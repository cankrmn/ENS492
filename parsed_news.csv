0,,Burgeoning Cranefly Hacking Group Has A New Intel Gathering Tool,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33985/Burgeoning-Cranefly-Hacking-Group-Has-A-New-Intel-Gathering-Tool.html,28/10/2022,"An undocumented dropper uses a new technique of reading commands from Internet Information Services (IIS) logs to carry out intelligence gathering and deliver backdoors, according to Symantec. Symantec’s blog post noted that the dropper, Trojan.Geppei, is linked to a threat actor Symantec calls Cranefly (aka UNC3524) to install undocumented malware and tools. Cranefly is a hacking group  that targets corporate networks to steal emails from employees that deal with larger financial transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions. “We have never seen this technique used to date in real-world attacks. It could, in theory, be used to deliver different types of malware if leveraged by threat actors with different goals,” Brigid O Gorman, senior intelligence analyst at Symantec threat hunter team, told SC Media. During the malicious activity, the dropper reads commands from a legitimate IIS log, which is meant to record data from IIS, including web pages and apps. “The attackers can send commands to a compromised web server by disguising them as web access requests. IIS logs them as normal, but the dropper can read them as commands if they contain the strings Wrde, Exco, or Cllo, which do not normally appear in IIS log files,” Gorman explained. “These appear to be used for malicious HTTP request parsing by Geppei; the presence of these strings prompts the dropper to carry out activity on a machine,” the post added.  Hacktool.Regeorg is a backdoor that is used by the dropper, and the  code is accessible to the public on GitHub. Therefore, although it has been previously adopted by many APT groups, its use provides no hints for attribution, and Symantec cannot connect this activity to any groups besides UNC3524. The dropper also deploys a previously unseen malware known as Trojan.Danfuan. Based on .NET dynamic compilation technology, it is a DynamicCodeCompiler that compiles and executes received C# code and acts as a backdoor on compromised systems. Researchers highlighted that the use of new techniques and custom tools indicates that Cranefly is “a fairly skilled threat actor.” Mandiant, which first uncovered the group in December 2019, said that while their targets of corporate transactions hint at financial motivation, their longer-than-average dwell time of 21 days in 2021 suggests there could also be an espionage mandate. Symantec’s findings drew a similar conclusion. “While we do not see data being exfiltrated from victim machines, the tools deployed and efforts taken to conceal this activity indicate that the most likely motivation for this group is intelligence gathering,” the post noted.",undocu dropper us new techniqu read command internet inform servic ii log carri intellig gather deliv backdoor accord symantec symantec blog post note dropper trojangeppei link threat actor symantec call cranefli aka unc instal undocu malwar tool cranefli hack group target corpor network steal email employe deal larger financi transact merger acquisit never seen techniqu use date realworld attack could theori use deliv differ type malwar leverag threat actor differ goal brigid gorman senior intellig analyst symantec threat hunter team told sc medium malici activ dropper read command legitim ii log meant record data ii includ web page app attack send command compromis web server disguis web access request ii log normal dropper read command contain string wrde exco cllo normal appear ii log file gorman explain appear use malici http request pars geppei presenc string prompt dropper carri activ machin post ad hacktoolregeorg backdoor use dropper code access public github therefor although previous adopt mani apt group use provid hint attribut symantec connect activ group besid unc dropper also deploy previous unseen malwar known trojandanfuan base net dynam compil technolog dynamiccodecompil compil execut receiv c code act backdoor compromis system research highlight use new techniqu custom tool indic cranefli fair skill threat actor mandiant first uncov group decemb said target corpor transact hint financi motiv longerthanaverag dwell time day suggest could also espionag mandat symantec find drew similar conclus see data exfiltr victim machin tool deploy effort taken conceal activ indic like motiv group intellig gather post note ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'malware', 'spyware']"
1,,High Severity Vulnerability In GitHub Was Susceptible To Repo Jacking,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33978/High-Severity-Vulnerability-In-GitHub-Was-Susceptible-To-Repo-Jacking.html,27/10/2022,"Researchers on Wednesday reported they found a “high-severity” vulnerability in GitHub that could have let an attacker take control over a GitHub repository and potentially infect all applications and other code relying on it with malicious code. In a blog post, researchers from the Checkmarx Supply Chain Security team said using a technique known as Repo Jacking, an attacker can take control of a GitHub repository by exploiting a logical “hidden” flaw in the architecture that makes renamed users susceptible to such an attack. The researchers said all renamed usernames on GitHub were vulnerable to this flaw, including more than 10,000 packages on the Go, Swift, and Packagist package managers. “The practical meaning of this is that thousands of packages can immediately be hijacked and start serving malicious code to millions of users and many applications,” wrote the researchers. This vulnerability was fixed by GitHub following Checkmarx’s report and it’s no longer exploitable, say the researchers. Aviad Gershon, security researcher and team leader at Checkmarx, explained that earlier this year his team witnessed attackers using the Repo Jacking technique, which demonstrates how malicious actors will continually evolve their methodologies to find the simplest ways to leverage trusted open-source packages for maximum impact. “The security community needs to be proactively working together to find and close these gaps before the attackers do,” said Gershon. “As time-to-delivery requirements relentlessly pressure AppSec and development teams, and as low-code development becomes more common, the potential attack surface for hidden malicious code like this will grow exponentially."" Thousands of projects with millions of end users rely on open-source libraries and code repositories, which makes the repositories a very attractive target for threat actors, said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber. Parkin said if they can take control of a GitHub repository and insert malicious code into a trusted and widely used project, they can potentially infect tens of thousands to potentially millions of hosts with little additional effort.  “This is especially true for older projects that may still be widely used, but are not as actively maintained, as there are fewer eyes on the code so a malicious insertion could go unnoticed,” Parkin said. “The issue reported here [involving GitHub] is potentially severe, and there have been previous examples of repositories being hijacked to spread malicious code.” In research from Blackberry also released Wednesday, more than 80% of U.S. and North American organizations reported being notified of a vulnerability or attack affecting their software supply chain in the past year, though just 10% cited open source as the biggest impact on the security of their code. As SC Media has reported, part of the issue is the sheer volume of open-source code powering the modern internet, with 98% of applications using them, according to a report from Synopsys. Dan Lorenc, CEO and co-founder of Chainguard, likened it to an iceberg, where a little bit of the internet is floating above the water, while the rest “is the massive amount of open source beneath.”  But further enticing cybercriminals is the open-source development model itself: the collaborative approach, defined by sharing and reuse of code. Sonatype found an average 700% jump in attacks against open source projected over the last three years, while the cybersecurity community learned firsthand about the implications of open-source vulnerabilities when a flaw in Log4j, the popular Java logging package distributed under the Apache software license, was exploited. Checkmarx's Gershon said that before the GitHub vulnerability was fixed: ""The ramifications regarding some package managers ... eventually could have ended up with millions of infected end-users poisoned with whichever malicious code the attackers could think of. Specifically for GitHub, this means that any vulnerable GitHub action could have also been poisoned by exploiting this vulnerability and infecting CI/CD pipelines running them.” Melissa Bischoping, director, endpoint security research at Tanium, added that the prevalence of open-source software as shared libraries, dependencies and integrations across enterprise tooling and custom built projects can lead to Repo Jacking attacks such as these, which could scale, rapidly if successful.   Bischoping said when developing software, it’s essential for dev teams to audit the code in those repositories, as well as create their own private fork to work, as opposed to pulling from the current public repository. Bischoping advised security teams to avoid pulling code “live” from sources such as GitHub repos that they don’t control and audit.  “Otherwise, it’s impossible to conduct proper security reviews on every single change,” Bischoping said. “If you’re a consumer of a third-party product, keep an accurate inventory via software bill of materials (SBOM) solutions to have insight into dependencies and risks. While we hope to see more software providers offer clear and transparent documentation of their dependencies and libraries, SBOMs serve as an essential tool to empower security team to understand if and when these vulnerabilities impact them.”  Tim Mackey, principal security strategist at the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center, said it’s important to understand that any GitHub attack first starts with compromising a GitHub account. Mackey said enabling two-factor authentication or the use of the GitHub Mobile registration are two important ways to reduce the potential for any GitHub account to be compromised. The next step, said Mackey, is for GitHub users to clearly define an end-of-life or transition plan for each repo that they are responsible for. “This includes having trusted individuals as owners or group accounts and defining a GitHub successor, in addition to publishing explicit end-of-life or deprecation statements,” Mackey said. “Of course, responsibility for the overall lifecycle of any open-source project includes the consumers of that code, so anyone choosing any new project shouldn’t be looking at the historical popularity of the project, but instead should be looking for evidence that the project is actively maintained and is healthy.”",research wednesday report found highsever vulner github could let attack take control github repositori potenti infect applic code reli malici code blog post research checkmarx suppli chain secur team said use techniqu known repo jack attack take control github repositori exploit logic hidden flaw architectur make renam user suscept attack research said renam usernam github vulner flaw includ packag go swift packagist packag manag practic mean thousand packag immedi hijack start serv malici code million user mani applic wrote research vulner fix github follow checkmarx report longer exploit say research aviad gershon secur research team leader checkmarx explain earlier year team wit attack use repo jack techniqu demonstr malici actor continu evolv methodolog find simplest way leverag trust opensourc packag maximum impact secur communiti need proactiv work togeth find close gap attack said gershon timetodeliveri requir relentless pressur appsec develop team lowcod develop becom common potenti attack surfac hidden malici code like grow exponenti thousand project million end user reli opensourc librari code repositori make repositori attract target threat actor said mike parkin senior technic engin vulcan cyber parkin said take control github repositori insert malici code trust wide use project potenti infect ten thousand potenti million host littl addit effort especi true older project may still wide use activ maintain fewer eye code malici insert could go unnot parkin said issu report involv github potenti sever previous exampl repositori hijack spread malici code research blackberri also releas wednesday u north american organ report notifi vulner attack affect softwar suppli chain past year though cite open sourc biggest impact secur code sc medium report part issu sheer volum opensourc code power modern internet applic use accord report synopsi dan lorenc ceo cofound chainguard liken iceberg littl bit internet float water rest massiv amount open sourc beneath entic cybercrimin opensourc develop model collabor approach defin share reus code sonatyp found averag jump attack open sourc project last three year cybersecur communiti learn firsthand implic opensourc vulner flaw logj popular java log packag distribut apach softwar licens exploit checkmarx s gershon said github vulner fix ramif regard packag manag eventu could end million infect endus poison whichev malici code attack could think specif github mean vulner github action could also poison exploit vulner infect cicd pipelin run them melissa bischop director endpoint secur research tanium ad preval opensourc softwar share librari depend integr across enterpris tool custom built project lead repo jack attack could scale rapid success bischop said develop softwar essenti dev team audit code repositori well creat privat fork work oppos pull current public repositori bischop advis secur team avoid pull code live sourc github repo control audit otherwis imposs conduct proper secur review everi singl chang bischop said consum thirdparti product keep accur inventori via softwar bill materi sbom solut insight depend risk hope see softwar provid offer clear transpar document depend librari sbom serv essenti tool empow secur team understand vulner impact them tim mackey princip secur strategist synopsi cybersecur research center said import understand github attack first start compromis github account mackey said enabl twofactor authent use github mobil registr two import way reduc potenti github account compromis next step said mackey github user clear defin endoflif transit plan repo respons includ trust individu owner group account defin github successor addit publish explicit endoflif deprec statement mackey said cours respons overal lifecycl opensourc project includ consum code anyon choos new project look histor popular project instead look evid project activ maintain healthi ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'microsoft', 'flaw']"
2,,"Researchers Uncover Cryptojacking Campaign Targeting Docker, Kubernetes Cloud Servers",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33975/Researchers-Uncover-Cryptojacking-Campaign-Targeting-Docker-Kubernetes-Cloud-Servers.html,26/10/2022,"Researchers at CrowdStrike have discovered a new hacking campaign that targets cloud infrastructure around the world in service of a cryptojacking scheme. The campaign – dubbed ""Kiss-A-Dog"" – dates back to at least September, when a CrowdStrike honeypot first began picking up signs of attacks targeting vulnerable Docker and Kubernetes instances. The name given to the campaign derives from the domain name used by attackers to fetch the Python-coded malware payload: kiss[.]a-dog[.]top. It leverages multiple command and control servers to escape containerized environments and gain root privileges, while using kernel and user rootkits for obfuscation, creating backdoors, lateral movement and persistence. The attackers also demonstrated the ability to detect and uninstall third-party cloud monitoring services. Once they gained a foothold within a compromised container, the threat actors sought to compile network scanning tools to look for additional cloud servers running Docker and Kubernetes. And there are plenty to find. According to Shodan, there are more than 68,000 vulnerable Kubernetes instances (16,915 in the U.S.) and 13,000 Docker instances (2,320 in the U.S.) exposed to the internet globally. According to researchers, the ultimate goal was to harness victims’ computing power to install XMRig and mine cryptocurrency. While these attacks have been happening for some time before they were first observed by CrowdStrike, a parallel crash of the cryptocurrency market over the summer likely “muffled” their visibility and impact at first. “The campaigns by cryptojacking groups last from days to months depending on the success rate,” wrote Manoj Ahuje, senior threat researcher for cloud security. “As cryptocurrency prices have dropped, these campaigns have been muffled in the past couple of months until multiple campaigns were launched in October to take advantage of a low competitive environment.” CrowdStrike doesn’t make a firm attribution around the campaign, but does note that multiple attacks emanated from command and control servers that were previously used by TeamTNT, a hacking group known to target cloud and container environments. Research from Trend Micro released Oct. 19 tracks a very similar-sounding cryptomining campaign from actors that also target cloud containers, use TeamTNT routines and install XMRig on victim servers. However, Trend Micro senior threat researcher Sunil Bharti wrote that “analysis of the attack patterns and other technical details of the code has also led us to believe that the routines are mimicking TeamTNT’s arsenal, but are likely deployed by another cryptocurrency mining group named WatchDog.”",research crowdstrik discov new hack campaign target cloud infrastructur around world servic cryptojack scheme campaign – dub kissadog – date back least septemb crowdstrik honeypot first began pick sign attack target vulner docker kubernet instanc name given campaign deriv domain name use attack fetch pythoncod malwar payload kiss adog top leverag multipl command control server escap container environ gain root privileg use kernel user rootkit obfusc creat backdoor later movement persist attack also demonstr abil detect uninstal thirdparti cloud monitor servic gain foothold within compromis contain threat actor sought compil network scan tool look addit cloud server run docker kubernet plenti find accord shodan vulner kubernet instanc u docker instanc u expos internet global accord research ultim goal har victim comput power instal xmrig mine cryptocurr attack happen time first observ crowdstrik parallel crash cryptocurr market summer like muffl visibl impact first campaign cryptojack group last day month depend success rate wrote manoj ahuj senior threat research cloud secur cryptocurr price drop campaign muffl past coupl month multipl campaign launch octob take advantag low competit environ crowdstrik make firm attribut around campaign note multipl attack eman command control server previous use teamtnt hack group known target cloud contain environ research trend micro releas oct track similarsound cryptomin campaign actor also target cloud contain use teamtnt routin instal xmrig victim server howev trend micro senior threat research sunil bharti wrote analysi attack pattern technic detail code also led u believ routin mimick teamtnt arsenal like deploy anoth cryptocurr mine group name watchdog ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'data loss', 'cryptography']"
3,,Senator Pushes Zuckerberg On How Facebook Collects Health Information,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33970/Senator-Pushes-Zuckerberg-On-How-Facebook-Collects-Health-Information.html,25/10/2022,"Following Advocate Aurora Health’s notice to 3 million patients of privacy violations due to its use of Facebook’s Pixel on its patient portal and applications, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., sent a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seeking information into the company’s practice of collecting consumer health information through its tracking tool. Warner asks: “Where required by law, does Meta always comply with any and all notification requirements when the Meta Pixel handles or transmits protected information, in the manner and time required by such laws?” The senator’s letter follows a WakeMed notification to 495,000 of its patients informing them of the impermissible disclosure of their information to third parties due to its use of Pixels. Novant Health ACE released a similar notice just one month after multiple reports revealed that hospital websites using Pixel were inadvertently sharing patient data with the social media giant. The scraped data shared with Facebook included medical conditions, reasons for the appointment, provider names, contact details, IPs, and information into the appointments. Some users have even shared that they've been targeted by advertisements on Meta platforms. The Meta Pixel is installed on an estimated 33 out of the 100 hospitals in the U.S., as well as patient portals used by seven health systems, which means the public may see more of these patient notifications into the foreseeable future. Parent company Meta is currently defending itself from multiple consumer-led lawsuits over these allegations. Warner, a staunch advocate for consumer privacy and cybersecurity, “is troubled by the recent revelations,” and his letter demands transparency into these practices given its violation of patient privacy — and the lack of user consent into these practices. The “last two years have shown us the importance of health care technology, with many relying on electronic health records, online appointment booking, and virtual patient portals to receive care during the pandemic,” Warner wrote. As healthcare increasingly moves online, strong safeguards are paramount for these platforms to protect sensitive health information. Referencing past issues with Pixel and its use on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid website and a report from the New York State Department of Financial Services that found similar data scraping practices, Warner fears “these continuing privacy violations and harmful uses of health data could become the new status quo in health care and public health.” What’s more, it appears Meta is violating its own business guidelines by enabling its tool to obtain personal data. As the senator observed, the policy states the company doesn’t “want websites or apps sending [Meta] sensitive information about people.” “Yet, in this most recent case and as we have seen previously, Meta is continuing to access this highly sensitive information,” Warner noted. “How does Meta handle sensitive information that it receives from third parties that violate its business guidelines?” Zuckerburg is asked to promptly provide Warner with information into the precise information Meta previously and currently has access to or receives directly from Pixel, as well as how it stores the information it receives through the tool. Warner also wants to understand how it’s protecting the health information it receives, “particularly with third-party vendors.” Warner also wants to know what Meta has done in the wake of the damning reports into the Pixel data scraping, as well as the report from the NYDFS that showed Meta’s “filtering system was ‘not yet operating with complete accuracy.” In short, Zuckerberg needs to explain how the company has improved the effectiveness of its filtering system, in addition to the testing and evaluation used to determine the ability to identify sensitive health information. Lastly, the senator wants to know whether the data Meta has received from Pixel has indeed been used to inform targeted advertisements on its platforms. “It is critical that technology companies like Meta take seriously their role in protecting user health data,” Warner concluded. Reports show the North Carolina Attorney General has launched its own investigation into these dubious practices.",follow advoc aurora health notic million patient privaci violat due use facebook pixel patient portal applic sen mark warner dva sent letter meta ceo mark zuckerberg seek inform compani practic collect consum health inform track tool warner ask requir law meta alway compli notif requir meta pixel handl transmit protect inform manner time requir law senat letter follow wakem notif patient inform impermiss disclosur inform third parti due use pixel novant health ace releas similar notic one month multipl report reveal hospit websit use pixel inadvert share patient data social medium giant scrape data share facebook includ medic condit reason appoint provid name contact detail ip inform appoint user even share ve target advertis meta platform meta pixel instal estim hospit u well patient portal use seven health system mean public may see patient notif forese futur parent compani meta current defend multipl consumerl lawsuit alleg warner staunch advoc consum privaci cybersecur troubl recent revel letter demand transpar practic given violat patient privaci — lack user consent practic last two year shown u import health care technolog mani reli electron health record onlin appoint book virtual patient portal receiv care pandem warner wrote healthcar increas move onlin strong safeguard paramount platform protect sensit health inform referenc past issu pixel use free applic feder student aid websit report new york state depart financi servic found similar data scrape practic warner fear continu privaci violat harm us health data could becom new status quo health care public health appear meta violat busi guidelin enabl tool obtain person data senat observ polici state compani want websit app send meta sensit inform peopl yet recent case seen previous meta continu access high sensit inform warner note meta handl sensit inform receiv third parti violat busi guidelin zuckerburg ask prompt provid warner inform precis inform meta previous current access receiv direct pixel well store inform receiv tool warner also want understand protect health inform receiv particular thirdparti vendor warner also want know meta done wake damn report pixel data scrape well report nydf show meta filter system ‘ yet oper complet accuraci short zuckerberg need explain compani improv effect filter system addit test evalu use determin abil identifi sensit health inform last senat want know whether data meta receiv pixel inde use inform target advertis platform critic technolog compani like meta take serious role protect user health data warner conclud report show north carolina attorney general launch investig dubious practic ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'facebook']"
4,,"New York Fines EyeMed $4.5 Million For 2020 Email Hack, Data Breach",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33956/New-York-Fines-EyeMed-4.5-Million-For-2020-Email-Hack-Data-Breach.html,20/10/2022,"The state of New York has slapped EyeMed Vision Care with yet another fine over its massive 2020 email hack and healthcare data breach. This time the vision benefits company will pay a $4.5 million penalty for multiple security violations that “contributed to” the data exposure. The state’s investigation into the insurer found “EyeMed’s lack of compliant cybersecurity risk assessment to evaluate and address the risks to its information systems and non-public information stored on its networks left EyeMed vulnerable to threat actors, including the threat actor who initiated the cyber event,” according to the report. The settlement was announced as part of New York’s Department of Financial Services’ cybersecurity regulation that mandates a set of responsible security standards for businesses. Drawn into effect in March 2017, it “served as a model for other regulators,” including the FTC, multiple states, and other security models. The law includes standards for industry compliance, consumer data protection, cybersecurity controls, and timely reporting of cybersecurity events. The DFS investigation into EyeMed found multiple violations of these requirements. “It is critically important that consumers’ non-public information is kept safe from potential criminal activity,” Superintendent of Financial Services Adrienne A. Harris said in the release. “This settlement demonstrates DFS’s ongoing commitment to protecting consumers while ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions from cyber threats.” DFS launched an investigation into EyeMed following its breach notification in December 2020 that reported an email hack first discovered five months earlier. A threat actor used the access to a single employee email account to send phishing emails to contacts within the address book. An earlier settlement with New York for $600,000 that followed a state investigation, revealed several discrepancies with EyeMed’s breach notification. First, EyeMed did not disclose that the attacker actually sent at least 2,000 phishing emails from the compromised account during the dwell time. The emails impersonated proposal requests that aimed to dupe victims into sharing their credentials. Further, the IT team received inquiries from clients and detected the suspicious transmissions on July 1. While EyeMed previously reported the account access was blocked and secured on the same day it was discovered, the previous investigation found the hack began a week before it was discovered. In total, the data of 2.1 million current and former vision benefits members of multiple insurance clients was compromised by the incident. The data included vision and health insurance account and identification numbers, Medicaid or Medicare numbers, driver’s licenses, government IDs, and birth or marriage certificates. Some members saw their Social Security numbers, financial data, diagnoses, health conditions, treatments, and other sensitive data. The findings of the DFS investigation into EyeMed found deeper security failings than previously disclosed. The audit revealed that EyeMed had violated the DFS’s cybersecurity regulation by failing to implement multi-factor authentication within its email environment. The state regulation requires MFA to be used for any users “accessing a covered entity’s internal network from an external network.” “At the time of the cyber event, EyeMed was in the process of rolling out MFA for its email environment, but did not yet have MFA implemented for the mailbox, as required by the cybersecurity regulation,” according to the report. In addition, EyeMed transitioned its email system to Microsoft Office 365 18 months before the hack. Although the regulation went into effect on March 1, 2018, the MFA implementation did not begin until March 2020, two years later. The O365 accessed the internal networks during the time MFA was not fully implemented. The MFA project was not completed until September 2020. DFS found that “the delay in MFA implementation left EyeMed’s information systems and its consumers’ non-public information vulnerable to threat actors.” Further, the investigation found the insurer failed to limit user access privileges. In fact, nine employees were allowed to share login credentials to the email account behind the weeklong hack. EyeMed also failed to implement sufficient data retention and disposal processes required by DFS. Namely, the hacked account contained “over six years’ worth of consumer non-public information, including that of minors.” To DFS, “had these controls been in place, the July 1, 2020, cybersecurity event could have been prevented or been limited in scope."" DFS also found EyeMed hadn’t conducted an adequate risk assessment between 2018 and 2021, which would have identified the access privilege and data disposal risks tied to its email accounts. Notably, had EyeMed conducted the risk assessment it could have avoided several of the violations found by DFC, including the requirement to leverage an adequate risk assessment to then build an effective cybersecurity program able to “address information security, access controls and identity management, and customer data privacy.” The finding also suggests that after discovering the email hack and conducting its investigation over the course of five months in 2020, EyeMed still didn’t perform a risk assessment for more than a year after the incident. A risk assessment is not only a core requirement of DFS, it’s also mandated by The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The report shows “to date, EyeMed has not conducted a risk assessment that complies with the requirements of the cybersecurity regulation.” Although the insurer has a third-party vendor conduct “periodic audits” of its IT controls and “enterprise risk management reviews,” it does not meet the regulatory standards. What’s more, these vendor assessments did not cover the email system where the hack occurred. DFS added that “as a result, EyeMed’s cybersecurity certifications for the calendar years 2018 through 2021 were improper.” Lastly, EyeMed was also found to have violated the DFS requirement to annually certify compliance with the cybersecurity regulation. The multi-million dollar settlement also requires EyeMed to “undertake significant remedial measures to better secure its data.” The insurance carrier must take on a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment, then develop a plan to address any risks identified during its audit. DFS will then review and approve the plan.",state new york slap eyem vision care yet anoth fine massiv email hack healthcar data breach time vision benefit compani pay million penalti multipl secur violat contribut data exposur state investig insur found eyem lack compliant cybersecur risk assess evalu address risk inform system nonpubl inform store network left eyem vulner threat actor includ threat actor initi cyber event accord report settlement announc part new york depart financi servic cybersecur regul mandat set respons secur standard busi drawn effect march serv model regul includ ftc multipl state secur model law includ standard industri complianc consum data protect cybersecur control time report cybersecur event dfs investig eyem found multipl violat requir critic import consum nonpubl inform kept safe potenti crimin activ superintend financi servic adrienn a harri said releas settlement demonstr dfs ongo commit protect consum ensur safeti sound financi institut cyber threat dfs launch investig eyem follow breach notif decemb report email hack first discov five month earlier threat actor use access singl employe email account send phish email contact within address book earlier settlement new york follow state investig reveal sever discrep eyem breach notif first eyem disclos attack actual sent least phish email compromis account dwell time email imperson propos request aim dupe victim share credenti team receiv inquiri client detect suspici transmiss juli eyem previous report account access block secur day discov previous investig found hack began week discov total data million current former vision benefit member multipl insur client compromis incid data includ vision health insur account identif number medicaid medicar number driver licens govern id birth marriag certif member saw social secur number financi data diagnosi health condit treatment sensit data find dfs investig eyem found deeper secur fail previous disclos audit reveal eyem violat dfs cybersecur regul fail implement multifactor authent within email environ state regul requir mfa use user access cover entiti intern network extern network time cyber event eyem process roll mfa email environ yet mfa implement mailbox requir cybersecur regul accord report addit eyem transit email system microsoft offic month hack although regul went effect march mfa implement begin march two year later o access intern network time mfa fulli implement mfa project complet septemb dfs found delay mfa implement left eyem inform system consum nonpubl inform vulner threat actor investig found insur fail limit user access privileg fact nine employe allow share login credenti email account behind weeklong hack eyem also fail implement suffici data retent dispos process requir dfs name hack account contain six year worth consum nonpubl inform includ minor dfs control place juli cybersecur event could prevent limit scope dfs also found eyem conduct adequ risk assess would identifi access privileg data dispos risk tie email account notabl eyem conduct risk assess could avoid sever violat found dfc includ requir leverag adequ risk assess build effect cybersecur program abl address inform secur access control ident manag custom data privaci find also suggest discov email hack conduct investig cours five month eyem still perform risk assess year incid risk assess core requir dfs also mandat health insur portabl account act report show date eyem conduct risk assess compli requir cybersecur regul although insur thirdparti vendor conduct period audit control enterpris risk manag review meet regulatori standard vendor assess cover email system hack occur dfs ad result eyem cybersecur certif calendar year improp last eyem also found violat dfs requir annual certifi complianc cybersecur regul multimillion dollar settlement also requir eyem undertak signific remedi measur better secur data insur carrier must take comprehens cybersecur risk assess develop plan address risk identifi audit dfs review approv plan ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
5,,"Ransomware Targets Transportation Sectors In Ukraine, Poland",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33948/Ransomware-Targets-Transportation-Sectors-In-Ukraine-Poland.html,19/10/2022,"A new ransomware campaign has been targeting transportation and logistics organizations in Ukraine and Poland, according to Microsoft. The novel ransomware, labeled ""Prestige ransomware,"" was first identified October 11 and targeted numerous victims within the same one-hour window, according to Microsoft's Threat Intelligence Center. Researchers were not able to tie the strain to any of the 94 active ransomware groups they are currently tracking. The victim profiles share similarity to recent Russian state-aligned activity and overlap with previous victims of HermeticWiper malware, but researchers noted that the campaign is separate from those destructive attacks, which have been targeting Ukrainian organizations since before the Russian invasion began in February. Russia is also one of the global epicenters of ransomware, where many of the top criminal hacking groups are based and maintain an ambiguous and symbiotic relationship with the Kremlin and intelligence agencies.   Microsoft is continuing its investigation and is temporarily tracking the campaign as DEV-0960. The company is also working to notify affected users who have not yet paid a ransom. Researchers noted that the campaign used three different methods to deploy the payloads across the victims’ network, which is uncommon for ransomware attacks. “Most ransomware operators develop a preferred set of tradecrafts for their payload deployment and execution, and this tradecraft tends to be consistent across victims, unless a security configuration prevents their preferred method,” MSTIC explained. “For this DEV-0960 activity, the methods used to deploy the ransomware varied across the victim environments, but it does not appear to be due to security configurations preventing the attacker from using the same techniques.” In one method, the ransomware payload is copied to the ADMIN$ share of a remote system, and an Impacket is used to remotely create a Windows Scheduled Task on target systems to execute the payload. In another, the payload is copied to the ADMIN$ share of a remote system, and Impacket is used to remotely invoke an encoded PowerShell command on target systems. Researchers also found cases where the ransomware payload is copied to an Active Directory Domain Controller and deployed to systems through the Default Domain Group Policy Object. In response to the complexity of the threat actors, Microsoft recommended several actions to help organizations defend against potential attacks. The mitigation advice includes blocking process creations that originate from PSExec and WMI commands to stop lateral movement, enabling Taper protection to prevent attacks from stopping or interfering with Microsoft Defender, turning on cloud-delivered protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus, and enabling multi-factor authentication to enforce any remote connectivity. “Targeting countries that are assisting Ukraine is a possible next step for Russian cyber actors and represents an escalation of the conflict in this sphere. Neighboring countries are the most likely to be affected,"" Dick O'Brien, principle intelligent analyst at Symantec's Threat Hunter Team, told SC Media in an email.",new ransomwar campaign target transport logist organ ukrain poland accord microsoft novel ransomwar label prestig ransomwar first identifi octob target numer victim within onehour window accord microsoft s threat intellig center research abl tie strain activ ransomwar group current track victim profil share similar recent russian statealign activ overlap previous victim hermeticwip malwar research note campaign separ destruct attack target ukrainian organ sinc russian invas began februari russia also one global epicent ransomwar mani top crimin hack group base maintain ambigu symbiot relationship kremlin intellig agenc microsoft continu investig temporarili track campaign dev compani also work notifi affect user yet paid ransom research note campaign use three differ method deploy payload across victim network uncommon ransomwar attack ransomwar oper develop prefer set tradecraft payload deploy execut tradecraft tend consist across victim unless secur configur prevent prefer method mstic explain dev activ method use deploy ransomwar vari across victim environ appear due secur configur prevent attack use techniqu one method ransomwar payload copi admin share remot system impacket use remot creat window schedul task target system execut payload anoth payload copi admin share remot system impacket use remot invok encod powershel command target system research also found case ransomwar payload copi activ directori domain control deploy system default domain group polici object respons complex threat actor microsoft recommend sever action help organ defend potenti attack mitig advic includ block process creation origin psexec wmi command stop later movement enabl taper protect prevent attack stop interf microsoft defend turn clouddeliv protect microsoft defend antivirus enabl multifactor authent enforc remot connect target countri assist ukrain possibl next step russian cyber actor repres escal conflict sphere neighbor countri like affect dick obrien principl intellig analyst symantec s threat hunter team told sc medium email ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'cyberwar', 'cryptography']"
6,,Army Cloud Plan Keys-In On Creating A Zero Trust Architecture,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33946/Army-Cloud-Plan-Keys-In-On-Creating-A-Zero-Trust-Architecture.html,18/10/2022,"Like other parts of the federal government, the Army’s cloud plan and data plan put a big focus on zero-trust. The Army’s cloud plan, announced last week at the Association of the US Army Conference, said it will take advantage of a zero-trust architecture to create a global cloud network without routing all traffic to a boundary cloud access point, while providing touch points to the Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN) only where necessary. As per the DOD’s zero-trust strategy, protecting Army data while at rest, in motion, and in use is a “minimum barrier-to-entry” for future combat and weapon systems. The data plan emphasizes a disciplined approach to protecting sensitive information, leveraging concepts like attribute-based access control across the enterprise to allow DOD maximize the use of data while also employing more stringent security standards. The Army is planning fulfill its own definition of a zero-trust architecture by relying on a mix of newly purchased solutions and legacy software. That set up will be configured and modified where necessary to lay the groundwork for more advanced tools like security, orchestration automation and response, as well as new data analytic capabilities. Other lines of effort include establishing training programs and culture around cloud computing, extending a suite of shared services to the Army’s private cloud that can operate even in a disconnected state and developing an enterprise cloud portal to integrate cloud initiatives across the Army, DoD, industry, and academia. On the broader cloud front, the Army also announced its $1 billion Enterprise Application Modernization and Migration (EAMM) contract, which aims to offer a more convenient way for Army IT teams to purchase cloud services. The service plans to structure the contract as an indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract with slots for multiple cloud vendors. Army spokesperson Bryce S. Dubee told SC Media that the contract will require vendors to provide application modernization services in a standard architecture that is based on zero trust for cybersecurity, while tools such as the Army's DevSecOps platform (called CReATE) will also be provided to vendors to enable a continuous Authority to Operate. ""The goal of the contract is to modernize and migrate enduring applications currently residing in Army on-premises data centers to the cARMY commercial cloud. This will enable the Army to close a number of on-premises data centers while at the same time help modernize the enduring applications to become cloud-native,"" Dubee said in an email. The push is part of a broader effort by Army CIO, Raj Iyer, to implement a zero-trust architecture across the entire Army in the next five years. At AUSA, Iyer cast the new contract as a means to simplify the Army's procurement environment, cutting down on the kind of contract shopping and bureaucratic delays that have made it difficult to carry out broad cloud migration mandates in the past. Under the new contract, offices could potentially award task orders from the contract in a month, far quicker than the status quo. ""This is going to become the easy button for the Army to actually move to the cloud, because right now what’s happening is even when we have commands that want to move to the cloud, today there’s not one contract that they can go to...so they are doing a lot of shopping,"" Iver said. ""They got to go to multiple contracting centers to go find the right vehicle and then when they go there it takes them nine months before they can actually get on contract."" The plans received mostly positive reviews from members of industry. These latest moves to the cloud based on centralized contracts are ""spot on"" when it comes to the way the DOD and other government agencies should look at cloud and data security, said Tony D’Angelo, vice president for North America Public Sector at Lookout. “Ideally these contracts aren't one-size-fits-all. Instead, they offer various types of clouds, services, and security solutions to meet the varied needs of a multitude of missions,""  D’Angelo said. ""The complexity of cloud migration and sorting through the broad landscape of solutions from the vendor community is best served under a centralized contract — but one with pre-vetted options that can  address the needs of the entire community.” Mohit Tiwari, co-founder and CEO at Symmetry Systems, added  that the Army’s move to the cloud presents an opportunity to build scalable security solutions. “With cloud expertise and skills -- particularly in security -- in high demand, this strategic contract is essential to speed up the contractual engagement of third parties and ensure appropriate and scalable security requirements are considered,” Tiwari said. Jerrod Piker, competitive intelligence analyst at Deep Instinct, told SC Media he likes the Army's plans on paper, but expressed concern that the initiative has been set with a tight timeline. “This plan will serve two roles,” Piker said. “First, it will allow the Army to perfect their model within an environment that’s under their own complete control to begin. Secondly, it will give them the chance to better classify their data and systems before moving to the public cloud.”  Creating a zero-trust architecture has been a major priority for DOD IT teams over the last two years. Earlier this year the military’s IT and communications arm said it will partner with contractor Booz Allen Hamilton on a six-month $6.8 million project to prototype a new security model based on zero-trust principles. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) said the project was designed to align with the May 2021 cybersecurity executive order issued by President Joe Biden. The new zero-trust focus will put a greater emphasis on protecting data and incorporate technologies and concepts — like secure access service edge (SASE) and SD-WANs — that were recommended in a zero-trust plan developed by DISA in 2020.",like part feder govern armi cloud plan data plan put big focus zerotrust armi cloud plan announc last week associ u armi confer said take advantag zerotrust architectur creat global cloud network without rout traffic boundari cloud access point provid touch point depart defens inform network dodin necessari per dod zerotrust strategi protect armi data rest motion use minimum barriertoentri futur combat weapon system data plan emphas disciplin approach protect sensit inform leverag concept like attributebas access control across enterpris allow dod maxim use data also employ stringent secur standard armi plan fulfil definit zerotrust architectur reli mix newli purchas solut legaci softwar set configur modifi necessari lay groundwork advanc tool like secur orchestr autom respons well new data analyt capabl line effort includ establish train program cultur around cloud comput extend suit share servic armi privat cloud oper even disconnect state develop enterpris cloud portal integr cloud initi across armi dod industri academia broader cloud front armi also announc billion enterpris applic modern migrat eamm contract aim offer conveni way armi team purchas cloud servic servic plan structur contract indefinitedeliveryindefinitequant idiq contract slot multipl cloud vendor armi spokesperson bryce s dube told sc medium contract requir vendor provid applic modern servic standard architectur base zero trust cybersecur tool armi s devsecop platform call creat also provid vendor enabl continu author oper goal contract modern migrat endur applic current resid armi onpremis data center carmi commerci cloud enabl armi close number onpremis data center time help modern endur applic becom cloudnat dube said email push part broader effort armi cio raj iyer implement zerotrust architectur across entir armi next five year ausa iyer cast new contract mean simplifi armi s procur environ cut kind contract shop bureaucrat delay made difficult carri broad cloud migrat mandat past new contract offic could potenti award task order contract month far quicker status quo go becom easi button armi actual move cloud right happen even command want move cloud today one contract go lot shop iver said got go multipl contract center go find right vehicl go take nine month actual get contract plan receiv most posit review member industri latest move cloud base central contract spot come way dod govern agenc look cloud data secur said toni angelo vice presid north america public sector lookout ideal contract nt onesizefitsal instead offer various type cloud servic secur solut meet vari need multitud mission angelo said complex cloud migrat sort broad landscap solut vendor communiti best serv central contract — one prevet option address need entir communiti mohit tiwari cofound ceo symmetri system ad armi move cloud present opportun build scalabl secur solut cloud expertis skill particular secur high demand strateg contract essenti speed contractu engag third parti ensur appropri scalabl secur requir consid tiwari said jerrod piker competit intellig analyst deep instinct told sc medium like armi s plan paper express concern initi set tight timelin plan serv two role piker said first allow armi perfect model within environ complet control begin second give chanc better classifi data system move public cloud creat zerotrust architectur major prioriti dod team last two year earlier year militari communic arm said partner contractor booz allen hamilton sixmonth million project prototyp new secur model base zerotrust principl defens inform system agenc disa said project design align may cybersecur execut order issu presid joe biden new zerotrust focus put greater emphasi protect data incorpor technolog concept — like secur access servic edg sase sdwan — recommend zerotrust plan develop disa ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'military']"
7,,Ransomware Attack Impacted Some CommonSpirit Sites,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33945/Ransomware-Attack-Impacted-Some-CommonSpirit-Sites.html,18/10/2022,"Now into its third week of care disruptions, a new update from CommonSpirit Health confirms that only a portion of its 700 care sites and 142 hospitals in 21 states have been impacted by the ransomware attack and subsequent IT and network outages. “There is no impact to clinic, patient care and associated systems at Dignity Health, Virginia Mason Medical Center, TriHealth or Centura Health facilities,” officials said in a statement. “Patients continue to receive the highest quality of care, and we are providing relevant updates on the ongoing situation to our patients, employees, and caregivers. Patient care remains our utmost priority.” Patient safety has been “central to our decision-making,” CommonSpirit officials stated. The care team is continuing to “carry out our mission in a manner that is safe and effective to those we serve.” Dignity Health is made up of 12 hospital or care facilities and 125 provider offices; TriHealth has 400 care sites and 39 hospitals; and Centura Health has 19 hospitals and what appears to be 488 provider offices. As such, it appears the bulk of the impact is concentrated in CHI Health facilities and Virginia Mason Franciscan Health, outside of VMMC. It appears that the impact is much smaller than sensationalized reports note. However, as Carter Groome, First Health Advisory CEO recently explained: “Patients suffer when their care is delayed, disrupted, and otherwise diverted,” with “indisputable” consequences. Even if just one hospital was hit, “a breach to one organization is a breach to our entire critical infrastructure of healthcare.” To better understand what may be going on behind the scenes and possible reasons for communication gaps, SC Media tuned in to a Critical Insights webcast and spoke with Jon Moore, Clearwater’s chief risk officer and senior vice president of services and customer success. “You want to be really careful throwing stones in glass houses,” Moore stressed. It’s truly the conundrum of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Security rule, where providers are victims of an attack launched by a nation-state or criminal actor, “which is not a trivial foe to be attacked by,” and then “we end up blaming the victim,"" he continued. As a bystander, it’s easy to watch the attack unfurl and immediately cast blame, but nothing is necessarily clear yet and all finger-pointing stems from conjecture. Until the facts are revealed about the incident, it will be impossible to know if they took HIPAA-required measures, or were negligent. As previously reported by SC Media, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a ransomware attack struck the network of hospitals on or around Oct. 3, prompting the response team to take the electronic health record and other systems offline to prevent the spread, at CommonHealth subsidiaries and hospitals across the country.  Until its latest notice, CommonSpirit had remained tight-lipped about the scope of the incident, which has caused outcry among nurses, patients, and even one security leader at an impacted hospital — all noting how the massive health system should be communicating its progress. But, if CommonSpirit is in direct communication with HHS leaders and has been working with law enforcement on its investigation, have they done their due diligence? “They're not being completely forthcoming yet, but they don't have to,” Fred Langston, Critical Insights’ founder and chief product officer, recently said during a webcast. But there’s likely a lot of negotiating going on at the moment, as the FBI and the insurance company are involved, in partnership with the team working to bring the systems back online to reduce the impact on hospitals that rely on CommonSpirit for their EHR. Communication might also be stymied by the number of parties involved, as well as coordination with law enforcement, Moore explained. And it’s likely CommonSpirit’s cyber liability insurance carrier is also involved with its legal team. “There's a lot of other people weighing in on what information is being communicated, and to whom.”  CommonSpirit is in “a bit of a challenging situation,” he added. The incident response group is probably being briefed regularly on the status, with a lot of information, including a lot of unknowns. The team is “probably being very careful to make sure what they say is factual.” As Moore put it, if you've ever been in some of these crisis situations in organizations, some people take the approach of being “as open, truthful, and honest, as we can.” Other individuals may align with the ideology that sharing each step may create “more ammunition for people to poke at us.” “It becomes more of marketing, political/legal conversation than anything else,” he added. The publicized information is likely sensitive to any possible class-action lawsuits that may come from the incident, as well as possible reporting obligations and any care disruptions that could impact their ability to safely provide care. HIPAA outlines precise reporting guidelines as they relate to a security incident and whether there’s been a breach of protected health information. But that is not needed until 60 days later, and that timer does not start until the breach has been discovered. As the Department of Health and Human Services is in direct contact with CommonSpirit, they appear to be following regulations. As Moore notes, typically in these kinds of outages there’s a lot going on behind the scenes that can range from “chaos, to the execution of a well-laid plan.” It’s currently unclear where CommonSpirit is on that spectrum. Given its size, “we can speculate they're probably not in chaos, but probably not as efficient as they could be in the execution of the incident response plans they may or may not have in place.” CommonSpirit is likely in the middle of a technical track, working to understand the nature of the attack, the variant used, the details of the attack itself, and its efforts to contain it, before moving to eradication. Moore explains they’re likely in the containment mode, actively shutting off systems to prevent the spread of the ransomware. Some systems may be down because of a direct infection, while others were likely turned off to prevent the spread of the infection. Once they move past that stage, they’ll move into the “eradication mode,” which will depend, to a certain extent, on whether they've identified the variant of ransomware used by looking for those indicators within their systems and try to remove those, Moore explained. However, “they need to be careful doing that because if they're on that parallel track, potentially negotiating with the attackers themselves, and begin eradicating things, and that can, to a certain extent, remove their ability to pay the ransom, because you've taken down the pieces that would facilitate that,” he added. Hopefully, the provider previously conducted a business impact analysis that would have created “tier systems” that dictate the order of technical recovery based on the impact to necessary business processes, said Moore. As such, they may be steadily working through those tiers to get mission critical systems back online as soon as possible. CommonSpirit could also be dealing with impacts to its backup systems or files, which could impact recovery, as well. But what’s clear is that they’re still working through these processes. The EHRs were not accessible, so while the responsibility may not fall on one particular entity’s shoulders, “as a hospital, if you still can't access your EHR, that's catastrophic,” Langston noted. “Because right now, if you go to a hospital, and you had a chemo session scheduled, they're having to reschedule,” said Michael Hamilton, Critical Insights CISO. “There's no record now that says, here are the antibiotics I'm allergic to.” CommonSpirit is an “interesting juxtaposition of things,” the day before the cyberattack and IT outage was reported, the provider “posted a billion dollar operating loss, which is common in the health sector,” explained Hamilton. “The health sector is on the ropes between its revenue down and margins down, and having to pay traveling nurses instead of staff nurses — hospitals are having a real hard time,” he continued. They posted an operating loss, and a day later, issued a $1.5 million bond. “I don't know if the event that's going on right now is going to impede their ability to raise funds because they certainly need to raise funds.” However, CommonSpirit is a parent company of hundreds of care sites and hospitals, as well as a provider of a lot of shared services like EHRs, which means the full impact of the event could be far greater than expected. What’s clear is that only a portion of CommonSpirit subsidiaries have been impacted, which indicates that only some care sites are sharing the IT and systems impacted by the ransomware attack. It could be that they were able to segment off their systems. As Moore noted, it’s the complexity of these disparate systems that may have reduced the impact, but it simultaneously increases the CommonSpirit footprint and likelihood of an unpatched vulnerability. As theories and patient safety concerns, continue to be shared, “the bottom line is, you're out of your EHR,” said Langston. “Affixing blame is ultimately down the road when the law dogs get involved. But this is really about, does your chief medical officer understand what to do if there's a breach that isn't even yours, preventing you from giving care?” “Moving to pencil and paper is viable, but you cannot handle the volume of clients, especially if we're in the middle of a pandemic, we're heading into the the flu season, and kids are back in school…all these things are gonna start impacting the volume of patients they can see. And if you slow down and pencil on paper, you're probably going to be diverting patients or canceling elective surgeries,” he added.",third week care disrupt new updat commonspirit health confirm

8,,Samsung Brings Blockchain Based Security To Smart Devices,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33942/Samsung-Brings-Blockchain-Based-Security-To-Smart-Devices.html,17/10/2022,"Samsung's new security solution Knox Matrix will work as a user's own private blockchain system and strengthen security through multi-layered mutual monitoring across connected devices, from smartphones to smart homes.   ""Today's connected world needs a connected security approach too — after all, if just one device is compromised, all others are at risk,” Shin Baik, principal engineer of the security team at the South Korean tech giant said during Samsung Developer Conference Wednesday. “Multi-device protection is the next battlefront for security and privacy.”   To safeguard users’ smart home from malicious access and simplify the login process, Knox Matrix will “share credentials device-to-device” and “protect sensitive information even between trusted devices,” according to a blog post from the company.   “Whether your Samsung devices are based on Android, Tizen, or other OS, Samsung Knox Matrix will be able to provide a unified security SDK,” the post read.   Samsung did not disclose technical details for the blockchain technology or when it plans to release Knox Matrix, besides saying in its post to “stay tuned.”   The adoption of blockchain technology has soared over the past few years within the financial technology industry (fintech), with researchers predicting the global fintech blockchain market to reach $8.7 billion by 2026, according to Research and Markets.   While this modern technology has gained popularity in the fintech industry, Patrick Moorhead, founder and CEO of Moor Insights & Strategy said in a blog post that there are more blockchain-related frauds than there are practical applications and innovative solutions. “This statement goes without saying, many incredible technologies within fintech and cryptocurrency have yet to change the world,” Moorhead noted. “I believe Samsung does have a real-word use case here with blockchain that does address the need for more security within IoT.”   Samsung has been identified as the most active investor in the blockchain and crypto space, participating in 13 funding rounds within the industry from September 2021 to mid-June 2022, according to Blockdata.   The company announced Friday that Samsung Wallet will expand to 13 new markets this year since it first launched in June 2022. Besides organizing and accessing essential documents and identifications, users can also monitor their cryptocurrency portfolio across various exchanges via the Wallet.   The Wallet is safeguarded by the company’s Samsung Knox security platform. It also stores sensitive documents in an isolated environment to add an extra layer of security protection.  ",samsung s new secur solut knox matrix work user s privat blockchain system strengthen secur multilay mutual monitor across connect devic smartphon smart home today s connect world need connect secur approach — one devic compromis other risk shin baik princip engin secur team south korean tech giant said samsung develop confer wednesday multidevic protect next battlefront secur privaci safeguard user smart home malici access simplifi login process knox matrix share credenti devicetodevic protect sensit inform even trust devic accord blog post compani whether samsung devic base android tizen o samsung knox matrix abl provid unifi secur sdk post read samsung disclos technic detail blockchain technolog plan releas knox matrix besid say post stay tune adopt blockchain technolog soar past year within financi technolog industri fintech research predict global fintech blockchain market reach billion accord research market modern technolog gain popular fintech industri patrick moorhead founder ceo moor insight strategi said blog post blockchainrel fraud practic applic innov solut statement go without say mani incred technolog within fintech cryptocurr yet chang world moorhead note believ samsung realword use case blockchain address need secur within iot samsung identifi activ investor blockchain crypto space particip fund round within industri septemb midjun accord blockdata compani announc friday samsung wallet expand new market year sinc first launch june besid organ access essenti document identif user also monitor cryptocurr portfolio across various exchang via wallet wallet safeguard compani samsung knox secur platform also store sensit document isol environ add extra layer secur protect ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'cryptography', 'samsung']"
9,,Data Of 380K Patients Compromised In Hack Of 13 Anesthesia Practices,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33939/Data-Of-380K-Patients-Compromised-In-Hack-Of-13-Anesthesia-Practices.html,13/10/2022,"The Department of Health and Human Services breach reporting tool recently added 13 separate filings from anesthesia practices across the U.S., stemming from a “data security incident” at the covered entities’ management company. In total, the compromise involved the protected health information of 380,104 patients. The HHS tool appears to center on entities tied to New York-based Resource Anesthesiology Associates and Anesthesia Associates, including sites in El Paso, California, Washington, Palm Springs, Lynbrook, Hazleton, Fredericksburg, Bronx, San Joaquin, and Maryland. Upstate Anesthesia Services is also listed. It’s currently unclear the name of the management company. A dive into how, or whether, these providers are connected found just one breach notice from Anesthesia Associates of El Paso PA, “an anesthesia provider to a local healthcare facility.” The breach notification shows the incident occurred on July 15, 2022 at “its management company.” No further details are shared as to the entity behind the incident, or the threat behind the compromise. However the incident occurred, it appears that protected health information stored in the management company’s system was impacted during the event, which included patient names, contact details, health insurance policy numbers, Social Security numbers, payment data, and health information, such as treatments and diagnoses.  The entities involved have since improved security controls to better “secure the system and protect patient information.” Three weeks after falling victim to a ransomware attack and data exfiltration incident, OakBend Medical Center reported the recovery team restored its network and clinical systems brought offline in the wake of the attack. OakBend brought the systems back online on Sept. 30, with some replacement processes being utilized as it finished recovering the impacted systems. One week later, the Texas provider began warning patients that third-party actors were targeting individuals with email schemes, with themes tied to the ransomware incident. As SC Media previously reported, OakBend Medical took its network offline and launched electronic health record downtime procedures in response to a ransomware incident deployed on Sept. 1. Two weeks later, the systems remained down as the team worked to rebuild the affected systems.  Officials quickly confirmed that the Daixin threat group claimed responsibility for the attack, posting data proofs on the dark web that contained more than 1 million records allegedly stolen from the hospital prior to the ransomware deployment. But now patients are facing further risks, as an Oct. 7 notice shows patients are receiving emails designed to appear as if sent from OakBend in regards to the data and system impacts. Hospital officials are warning patients that “all verified information regarding system updates, investigative findings, and next steps will continue to come directly from the office through email updates and website postings.” On Oct. 11, officials added that the forensic investigation is ongoing and has not determined the extent of the data theft, nor who was affected. Patients have been asked to send the hospital the fraudulent emails for analysis. OakBend is offering all patients 18 months of credit monitoring to support fraud prevention. Nearly 245,000 patients with ties to CSI Laboratories were recently notified that their data was compromised after a phishing incident gave a threat actor access to a single employee email account. The notice comes just six months after the Georgia-based cancer testing and diagnostics laboratory reported falling victim to a February cyberattack that led to IT disruptions and the exfiltration of data tied to 312,000 patients, such as names, patient case numbers, dates of birth, addresses, medical record numbers, and health insurance information. The latest security incident was discovered on July 8, which led the security team to promptly isolate the affected email account and launch an investigation. The forensic evidence shows the phishing attack appeared designed to commit financial fraud on other entities by redirecting customer payments from health providers to an account controlled by the actors using a fictitious email address. “The invoices were not directly billed to patients. Thus, we believe that the malicious actor was seeking to divert invoice payments,” rather than to access patient data, according to the notice. However, the investigation determined on July 15 that the hacker indeed acquired “certain files from the affected employee mailbox, including documents that may have contained patient information.” The discovery prompted a new analysis to determine the scope and impact on patient information. The exfiltrated data was found to involve invoices sent to CSI healthcare provider customers, which varied by invoice. The information “generally” contained patient names and numbers, as well as dates of birth and health insurance information. No patient financial data was compromised. CSI stressed that the incident was limited to a single email inbox, and its network and IT systems were not impacted by the event. Employees have since received additional phishing-related awareness and training, as CSI works to improve its enterprise security to prevent a recurrence. The personal and protected health information of 33,793 Aesthetic Dermatology Associates patients was accessed during a systems’ hack in August. It should be noted that an industry advisory shows the BianLian threat group has posted a data listing allegedly tied to Aesthetic Dermatology Associates. However, the provider’s notice purports there’s been no evidence of data misuse. The official notification shows that suspicious activity was discovered on Aug. 15, which prompted an investigation with support from a computer forensics specialist. The analysis discovered an attacker accessed its network systems, some of which contained personal information.  A review of those files confirmed PHI was accessed during the hack, which included patient names, diagnosis codes, dates of birth, contact details, and health insurance information. SSNs were not involved. Aesthetic Dermatology has since secured the affected systems and plan to implement additional safeguards to prevent another incident. Magellan Rx Management recently informed 13,663 TennCare patients, who leverage MRx for pharmacy benefit services, that their data was compromised after the hack of an email account belonging to its former auditing vendor NorthStar. MRx provides healthcare delivery and pharmacy management services to managed care entities, health plans, and and other third-party administrators. NorthStar previously disclosed its April email hack in early September, where a threat actor gained access to a single employee email account and accessed or stole Medicaid data tied to the Georgia Department of Community Health. About 18,354 members were affected by the incident. The incident was first detected on April 20, but MRx was not notified by NorthStar until July 25. The investigation determined the attacker had access to the account for more than two months between February 5, 2022 and April 17, 2022. During the dwell time, the actor accessed the account, but the investigators could not verify what, if any, data was accessed or acquired. For MRx, the account contained the personal data of patients enrolled in health plans serviced by MRx. The notice suggests NorthStar’s investigation is ongoing, which could account for the delay in notifying patients. And “although NorthStar is no longer an MRx vendor, MRx has processes in place to ensure that its vendors safeguard personal information within their possession.” The incident joins an earlier email compromise reported by MRx’s parent company Magellan Health in the last three years. Several weeks ago, Magellan Health settled a breach lawsuit for $1.43 million with the 270,000 patients whose data was compromised during a months-long hack of an employee email account in the Spring of 2019. An undisclosed number of patients tied to Cardiac Imaging Associates are just now learning that their data was compromised after the hack of an internal email account in April. CIA is a medical imaging services vendor for healthcare providers. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, breach notices should be sent to patients within 60 days of discovery and not at the close of an investigation. According to its notice, it appears that CIA’s delay was due to its investigation only recently being closed. Upon discovering the email intrusion, the account was secured. A subsequent investigation determined the threat actor had access to the account for a week between March 30 and April 6. The forensic analysis could not determine whether the actor viewed the emails or attachments within the accounts, which prompted a “thorough and time-intensive review of the contents of the email accounts.” The compromised data varied by patient and could include names, SSNs, dates of birth, driver's licenses, financial account and payment card information, medical diagnoses, conditions, lab results, treatments, and prescriptions. It’s possible the data was accessed or acquired.  CIA has since enhanced its security, as it reviews its existing policies and procedures and implements internal training protocols to mitigate possible risks.",depart health human servic breach report tool recent ad separ file anesthesia practic across u stem data secur incid cover entiti manag compani total compromis involv protect health

10,,Google Makes Major Play For Cloud Security Market,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33931/Google-Makes-Major-Play-For-Cloud-Security-Market.html,11/10/2022,"Google rolled out a new, consolidated, cloud-based suite of software security solutions Tuesday, merging existing cloud security offerings and integrating threat intelligence and detection tools and services gained through acquisitions of companies like Mandiant and Siemplify. The move crystalizes what many in the security market hypothesized during the last six months: A plan by Google to create a cloud offering more suitable for the enterprise, harnessing the vast resources and scale that the company dedicates to securing its own environment to deliver a managed service to smaller entities around the globe. “Nation state actors are increasingly spending more time not just on governments but on enterprises of all sizes, from big banks to the small credit unions,” said Sunil Potti, general manager and vice president of cloud security at Google Cloud. “Ultimately when you take a step back, only companies like Google or maybe an Amazon or Apple who have invested in protecting themselves at scale can maybe thwart that; but if there’s an opportunity for companies of all sizes to inhale the capabilities that Google has built to protect themselves, to protect their own customers, then there’s a real opportunity to structurally solve this problem.” The suite, called Chronicle Security Operations, will combine security capabilities from Google Cloud, Chronicle’s security information and event management (SIEM) technology and software gained through Google’s $500 million purchase of Israeli security orchestration, automation and response firm Siemplify. It will also place much of that data under a consolidated display, pulling information and context in from other sources like VirusTotal and Google Cloud Threat Intelligence. At the head of processing all that security data will be Mandiant, another recent acquisition.   Google is also introducing two new security products. The first, Confidential Space, is a trusted execution environment that uses a container optimized operating system to offer a secure, controlled place for multiple organizations to collaborate on projects and share sensitive data with each other. It builds off previous efforts by Google like Confidential Computing and Confidential Virtual Machines and is meant to support things like joint data analysis, machine learning modeling and projects where organizations wish to collaborate and share data but maintain control of the information and prevent appropriation or misuse.   The use cases Google offered include scenarios like banks and insurance agencies sharing joint customer data to root out fraud, healthcare and medical technology companies sharing information to speed up drug development cycles without exposing patient data and Web3 companies using remote attestation to buy or exchange assets. The second, called Software Security Shield, is a managed security solution that offers managed software development environments via Google Cloud, approved lists of open source software code packages that are regularly vetted for security by Google through scanning, fuzz-testing, analysis and other forms of curation, managed platforms for continuous development/continuous integration of applications and a policy engine for verifying the integrity of software code throughout the development and production lifecycle. Sunil Potti, general manager and vice president of cloud security at Google Cloud, said the moves represent an effort to harness the vast resources and scale that Google dedicates to securing its own enterprise and push them out to smaller organizations as a managed service. “Fundamentally we’re in this accelerating cyber situation where nation state actors, for example, are increasingly spending more time not just on governments but on enterprises of all sizes, from big banks to the small credit unions,” said Potti. “Ultimately when you take a step back, only companies like Google or maybe an Amazon or Apple who have invested in protecting themselves at scale can maybe thwart that; but if there’s an opportunity for most of these companies of all sizes to inhale the capabilities that Google has built to protect themselves, to protect their own customers, then there’s a real opportunity to structurally solve this problem.” The announcements also doubled as an opportunity to discuss the $5.4 billion acquisition of Mandiant, which Google finalized in September. Google chief information security officer Phil Venables said the pairing of Mandiant with Google Cloud “combines what we’re both good at”: Google’s SIEM and SOAR tech focusing on reactive defensive security tasks like event monitoring, logging analysis and digital forensics, and Mandiant’s offerings providing more “proactive” capabilities, that provide visibility into an organization’s overall attack surface and validate their existing security tools and processes. “We’ve already got excellent security information and event management and SOAR capabilities with things like Chronicle and Siemplify. With Mandiant, we can take all of that threat intelligence and incident response capability and align it with that and so it’s a really great natural and complimentary combination,” Venables told reporters. Google will retain Mandiant’s name and brand, and founder Kevin Mandia said his organization is “still do[ing] the work we’ve always done.” He predicted the integration of Mandiant into Google Cloud will “amplify” the impact of Mandiant intelligence by leveraging Google’s vast ecosystem of software and integration partners to reach a wider audience. Google’s purchase of Mandiant came a little more than a year after the threat intelligence firm split with FireEye (now Trellix) after seven years of partnership. At the time, Mandia spoke about the need to decouple Mandiant’s intelligence from FireEye security controls and products in order to present insights and analysis free from bias. Now the company will be tied to Google and its products, but Mandia told SC Media that he does not view the two situations as analogous. While part of FireEye, Mandiant’s analysis was restricted to telemetry from FireEye endpoints, firewalls and network security monitoring tools. Google’s portfolio is not reliant on those products or controls, and maintains integration partnerships with other threat intelligence firms like CrowdStrike, Cybereason and Fortinet that will still allow Mandiant to incorporate telemetry from a wide variety of sources. “As we respond to breaches and get to a mastery of here’s is what bad looks on a network, this is what unauthorized or unlawful or simply unacceptable behavior looks like and all this different telemetry, Google is best suited to bring that to market,” Mandia said. “So when I said we needed to be controls agnostic, that’s what I meant. At Mandiant we know what bad looks like, whether you’re using [endpoints from] Sentinel One, CrowdStrike’s, Symanetc, McAfee, Carbon Black…we want to work with Microsoft Defender, we want to work with all of them and impose security automation on top of all these control products that create the telemetry, so it’s still a perfect fit.” He analogized Mandiant’s role in the Google Cloud security ecosystem to that of a higher intelligence sitting on top of a broader security operation, culling and organizing data from disparate technologies and sources and then using them to inform strategy and decision-making. “When I think about it, I think of a physical world analogy: there’s going to be a thousand companies that make cameras, but there would need a brain for all the cameras to say there’s an intruder coming in the house or there’s something else happening…I see one of the things we can do best at Mandiant combined with Google is be that brain, be the hub for all the spokes,” he said. The moves announced by Google represent an attempt to stitch together many of the company’s core security offerings – some developed in-house, others added via acquisition – into a unified, cohesive managed service that is relevant to customers large and small as it seeks to compete with Amazon and other major cloud security providers. But experts told SC Media it will take more than throwing cash around to make Google a major player in the security space. Allie Mellen, an analyst at Forrester, called the news the most significant move for Google’s security analytics portfolio since the merging Google Cloud and Chronicle in 2019. Up until now, she said Chronicle has lacked critical enterprise features, like SOAR, that are often a requirement in a security analytics platform market that is trending towards consolidated toolsets. The unification of Google’s Chronicle’s SIEM with Siemplify’s SOAR and Mandiant's threat intelligence helps in “bridging the gap for Google to an enterprise offering.” “Mandiant’s quality security services on top of Chronicle’s storage, querying, and SOAR capabilities are a powerful combination, especially since very few competitors in the Security Analytics Platform market can offer the same with the same level of cohesion and partnership,” “However, some of the features need to mature before the product alone will be a robust SIEM offering, such as the analytics capabilities,” said Mellen.   Google’s success may also depend as much on how successfully it leverages the human expertise it has inherited as it does the technology. Mellen cited the addition of a known and trusted security brand in Mandiant as a real difference maker, a question that others raised as well. Adrian Sanabria, director of product management at Tenchi Security and host of the Enterprise Security Weekly Podcast, told SC Media that while Google has thrown a lot of money and resources into its cloud security program and brought in smart people like Mandia, it’s not yet clear how influential they will be in steering the company’s decision-making. For example, lessons gleaned from incident response engagements carried out by Mandiant can offer a “strong feedback loop” to Google’s product team that will allow them to adjust and keep their technologies relevant for the latest threats. He compared the situation to Cisco purchasing SourceFire in 2013 and giving founder Martin Roesch wide latitude to reshape their broader security program. Google’s success in this area may depend on taking a similar tack by empowering experts like Mandia. “Like Cisco in the early 2010s, Google currently isn't taken seriously as a security company,"" Sanabria said. The company ""clearly has the resources to build an impressive security offering and has a ton of smart people. They keep getting in their own way, need to collaborate more internally, and are sorely in need of effective leadership and marketing.”",googl roll new consolid cloudbas suit softwar secur solut

11,,Meta Uncovers 400 Malicious Apps On Android And iOS,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33928/Meta-Uncovers-400-Malicious-Apps-On-Android-And-iOS.html,11/10/2022,"Fraudsters are stealing Facebook users' information through malicious apps downloaded from Apple and Google's software stores, according to Facebook's parent company Meta.   The company announced Friday that it uncovered more than 400 malicious Android and iOS apps this year that target Facebook users to steal their login information. Meta said it reported findings to Apple and Google and the applications have been removed.   Meta's Director of Threat Disruption, David Agranovich, said that many of the apps are advertised as having ""fun or useful functionality,"" including photo editors, virtual private networks, mobile games, and health trackers. In reality, most have limited features, sometimes asking users to log in with their Facebook accounts to unlock additional capabilities. This is a way for fraudsters to obtain Facebook users' information. ""Many of the apps provided little to no functionality before you logged in, and most provided no functionality even after a person agreed to login,"" Agranovich said during a press briefing.   He also noted that this type of fraudulent activity does not target specific geographic regions, instead, it operates as a ""spray and pray"" tactic to get as many login credentials as possible.   Apple told SC Media that 45 of 400 malicious apps were on iOS and have already been removed from the App Store. ""The App Store was designed to be a safe and trusted place for users to download apps, and we have zero tolerance for fraud or apps designed with malicious intent,"" An Apple spokesperson said in an email.   SC Media reached out to Google today to confirm the number of malicious apps on Android and has not heard back from the company.  Alon Nachmany, Field CISO at AppViewX, told SC Media that it is rumored that Google has only checked the original version of apps but not continuously performed checks when apps are updated. On the contrary, he noted that Apple’s security checks are stricter, and app permissions are not as easy or open as they are on Android.   “It is critical to acknowledge that there is a balance between availability and security,” Nachmany said.   Tzachi Zornstain, head of supply chain security at Checkmarx, noted that in this case between Apple and Google, it is difficult to say one company’s security checks are more effective than the other.  “Both of them have devoted lots of efforts to improve their application security, and it is not as easy as many people think,” Zornstain said during an interview with SC Media.   Indeed, both Apple and Google have struggled for years to detect and remove malicious apps, with numerous vendors reporting malware disguised as legitimate software in both stores.   One of the most recent examples is the discovery of a new ad fraud campaign 'Scylla' by HUMAN‘s Satori Threat Intelligence & Research team last month. The apps targeted several advertising software development kits, featuring more than 75 Android apps and 10 iOS apps with 13 million total downloads before they were taken down.   The researchers noted that ‘Scylla’ is the third wave of an attack that dated back to August 2019. The second wave which they named ‘Charybdis’ was uncovered in late 2020.   Bitdefender also identified 35 malicious apps representing more than 2 million downloads on Google Play in August this year. The security vendor found that these apps concealed their presence by renaming themselves after installation to make detection and removal difficult.   As the US midterm elections are coming up, Agranovich told Bloomberg during an interview that Meta will stay vigilant and continue monitoring security threats on its platform.  ",fraudster steal facebook user inform malici app download appl googl s softwar store accord facebook s parent compani meta compani announc friday uncov malici android io app year target facebook user steal login inform meta said report find appl googl applic remov meta s director threat disrupt david agranovich said mani app advertis fun use function includ photo editor virtual privat network mobil game health tracker realiti limit featur sometim ask user log facebook account unlock addit capabl way fraudster obtain facebook user inform mani app provid littl function log provid function even person agre login agranovich said press brief also note type fraudul activ target specif geograph region instead oper spray pray tactic get mani login credenti possibl appl told sc medium malici app io alreadi remov app store app store design safe trust place user download app zero toler fraud app design malici intent appl spokesperson said email sc medium reach googl today confirm number malici app android heard back compani alon nachmani field ciso appviewx told sc medium rumor googl check origin version app continu perform check app updat contrari note appl secur check stricter app permiss easi open android critic acknowledg balanc avail secur nachmani said tzachi zornstain head suppli chain secur checkmarx note case appl googl difficult say one compani secur check effect devot lot effort improv applic secur easi mani peopl think zornstain said interview sc medium inde appl googl struggl year detect remov malici app numer vendor report malwar disguis legitim softwar store one recent exampl discoveri new ad fraud campaign scylla human ‘ satori threat intellig research team last month app target sever advertis softwar develop kit featur android app io app million total download taken research note ‘ scylla third wave attack date back august second wave name ‘ charybdi uncov late bitdefend also identifi malici app repres million download googl play august year secur vendor found app conceal presenc renam instal make detect remov difficult u midterm elect come agranovich told bloomberg interview meta stay vigil continu monitor secur threat platform ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'data loss', 'fraud', 'google', 'password', 'phish', 'apple', 'facebook']"
12,,New macOS Vuln Lets Malicious Apps Bypass Security Checks,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33925/New-macOS-Vuln-Lets-Malicious-Apps-Bypass-Security-Checks.html,10/10/2022,"Security researchers have released details about a new macOS vulnerability in Archive Utility that could be exploited to execute malicious applications in a way that bypasses Apple’s security checks.   The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2002-32910, was discovered in macOS Monterey 12.5 by Jamf Threat Labs, an Apple device management firm. Jamf noted this new flaw “could lead to the execution of an unsigned and unnotarized application without displaying security prompts to the user, by using a specifically crafted archive” in its recent blog post.   Jamf reported its findings to Apple on May 31, 2022. Apple said it patched the issue in macOS Big Sur 11.6.8 and Monterey 12.5 in July 2022. The tech giant also revised the advisories released on October 4 to add an entry for the vulnerability.   Jamf said the problem began when its researchers found a flaw in Safari that could go around Mac endpoint security by leveraging a crafted ZIP archive vulnerability, tracked under CVE-2022-22616. After reporting this vulnerability to Apple, researchers tested other archiving features and found the macOS Archive Utility flaw.   “We discovered that creating an Apple Archive with a similar command will also result in bypassing Gatekeeper and all security checks upon execution,” Jamf noted in the post.   Although the command looks like the ZIP command that could be used to attack CVE-2022-22616, this flaw is different as it does not exist with the Bill of Materials (BOM), according to Jamf.   An Apple Archive is the company’s proprietary format that allows for multithreaded lossless compression, with files having an extension “.aar” when shown in the finder. However, the vulnerability is not limited to Apple Archives.   Jamf explained that an archive will have an extended attribute titled “com.apple.quarantine” when it is downloaded from the internet. This attribute informs macOS that the file is downloaded from a remote source and needs to be checked before it is allowed to run. When Archive Utility extracts an archive, it applies the quarantine attribute to all the extracted items to ensure that any opened executable files will be checked by Gatekeeper.   But researchers found that in certain cases, Archive Utility fails to give some of the unarchive files the quarantine attribute. Therefore, the gatekeeper cannot check the files before they run. This flaw could lead to malicious applications automatically running, without users ever getting notified.   Aaron Kiemele, chief information security officer at Jamf, told SC Media that the risk of emerging vulnerability can be reduced with a focus on the fundamentals.   “Operating systems and applications need to be patched regularly, and anti-malware software will help in those instances where a patch isn’t applied,” Kiemele said. “These two controls, effective device management and anti-malware, support each other to reduce the security and privacy risks.”",secur research releas detail new maco vulner archiv util could exploit execut malici applic way bypass appl secur check vulner track cve discov maco monterey jamf threat lab appl devic manag firm jamf note new flaw could lead execut unsign unnotar applic without display secur prompt user use specif craft archiv recent blog post jamf report find appl may appl said patch issu maco big sur monterey juli tech giant also revis advisori releas octob add entri vulner jamf said problem began research found flaw safari could go around mac endpoint secur leverag craft zip archiv vulner track cve report vulner appl research test archiv featur found maco archiv util flaw discov creat appl archiv similar command also result bypass gatekeep secur check upon execut jamf note post although command look like zip command could use attack cve flaw differ exist bill materi bom accord jamf appl archiv compani proprietari format allow multithread lossless compress file extens aar shown finder howev vulner limit appl archiv jamf explain archiv extend attribut titl comapplequarantin download internet attribut inform maco file download remot sourc need check allow run archiv util extract archiv appli quarantin attribut extract item ensur open execut file check gatekeep research found certain case archiv util fail give unarch file quarantin attribut therefor gatekeep check file run flaw could lead malici applic automat run without user ever get notifi aaron kiemel chief inform secur offic jamf told sc medium risk emerg vulner reduc focus fundament oper system applic need patch regular antimalwar softwar help instanc patch appli kiemel said two control effect devic manag antimalwar support reduc secur privaci risk ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'flaw', 'apple', 'cryptography']"

The contract, which was awarded through the General Services Administration and could be worth up to $26 million, will give DoD component agencies access to the vendor’s proprietary deception platform in order to detect and monitor network traffic produced by malicious hackers targeting defense networks. According to federal procurement records, the contract is designed to serve three purposes: provide deception capabilities that can detect unauthorized breaches or access to U.S. government networks, alert agencies and study attackers; support integration of the solution into U.S. government networks with the ability to add new components or scale the platform over time; and train agencies on how to set up and deploy the platform to bolster threat intelligence on the tactics, techniques and procedures of different threat actors. The deception tech is needed, the government claims, because DoD cybersecurity officials “currently lack the technological platform and capabilities to withstand and gather intelligence from an ongoing cyber-attack."" The current response involves turning off connected systems, something that prevents them from learning more about the behaviors of adversaries targeting defense networks. “The current preferred defensive action is to disconnect an internet or network connected system during an attack. Disconnecting stops the ability of network operators from being able to gather telemetry data and characteristics of the attack,” the award justification states. “Cyber operations must leverage purpose-built and shaped terrain – decoy endpoints, networks, and artifacts – to deceive, disorient, and disrupt malicious cyber actors and impose cost and risk on our adversaries. CCSI’s software/licenses are intended to leverage cyber deception methodologies and capabilities to address these concerns.” The contract is an outgrowth of a project that initially began under the Defense Innovation Unit, an office housed within DoD that acts as an incubator for emerging IT and cybersecurity technologies for the government and partners with Silicon Valley startups and other nontraditional contractors. The underlying technology was part of a $679,000 prototype platform developed by CounterCraft and DIU for the Air Force in 2021, creating sophisticated deception environments that detect malicious cyber activity. According to DIU, it was tested in military wargames with national and NATO-level red teams. Patrick Gould, deputy director of the DIU’s cyber portfolio, told SC Media earlier this year that the office is often able to shepherd prototype technologies from the design stage to broader adoption throughout federal agencies in such a short time largely due to a unique acquisition process that eschews many of the traditional bureaucratic requirements that dominate contracting in other parts of the federal government. “We try to make it as commercially friendly as possible, so we try to mirror what those vendors are seeing specifically in the security realm, like if any other CISO was coming to them and saying ‘hey I want to use your capability,’” said Gould. The contact was awarded on a sole-source basis, meaning it was not competitively bid. The GSA claims that the government conducted extensive research and no other vendor is capable of providing these services, largely because CounterCraft’s platform is proprietary, has already been highly modified and other vendors would be restricted to operating the commercial-off-the-shelf version of the software. The agency also said they published a pre-solicitation synopsis of the requirements on federal contracting sites in August but have not received any responses from other vendors indicating they can meet the requirements.",feder govern award contract countercraft new decept platform deploy throughout depart defens contract award general servic administr could worth million give dod compon agenc access vendor proprietari decept platform order detect monitor network traffic produc malici hacker target defens network accord feder procur record contract design serv three purpos provid decept capabl detect unauthor breach access u govern network alert agenc studi attack support integr solut u govern network abil add new compon scale platform time train agenc set deploy platform bolster threat intellig tactic techniqu procedur differ threat actor decept tech need govern claim dod cybersecur offici current lack technolog platform capabl withstand gather intellig ongo cyberattack current respons involv turn connect system someth prevent learn behavior adversari target defens network current prefer defens action disconnect internet network connect system attack disconnect stop abil network oper abl gather telemetri data characterist attack award justif state cyber oper must leverag purposebuilt shape terrain – decoy endpoint network artifact – deceiv disori disrupt malici cyber actor impos cost risk adversari ccsi softwarelicens intend leverag cyber decept methodolog capabl address concern contract outgrowth project initi began defens innov unit offic hous within dod act incub emerg cybersecur technolog govern partner silicon valley startup nontradit contractor under technolog part prototyp platform develop countercraft diu air forc creat sophist decept environ detect malici cyber activ accord diu test militari wargam nation natolevel red team patrick gould deputi director diu cyber portfolio told sc medium earlier year offic often abl shepherd prototyp technolog design stage broader adopt throughout feder agenc short time larg due uniqu acquisit process eschew mani tradit bureaucrat requir domin contract part feder govern tri make commerci friend possibl tri mirror vendor see specif secur realm like ciso come say ‘ hey want use capabl said gould contact award solesourc basi mean competit bid gsa claim govern conduct extens research vendor capabl provid servic larg countercraft platform proprietari alreadi high modifi vendor would restrict oper commercialofftheshelf version softwar agenc also said publish presolicit synopsi requir feder contract site august receiv respons vendor indic meet requir ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'cyberwar', 'military']"
14,,Microsoft Says Fix For Two Exchange Zero Days On Accelerated Timeline,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33902/Microsoft-Says-Fix-For-Two-Exchange-Zero-Days-On-Accelerated-Timeline.html,"/10/1,","Microsoft late Thursday reported that it was investigating two reported zero-day vulnerabilities affecting on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange. In a blog where it issued customer guidance, Microsoft said it was working on an “accelerated schedule” to release a fix. The two zero-day vulnerabilities affect Microsoft Exchange Server 2013, 2016 and 2019. The vulnerabilities were first reported Thursday by Vietnamese security firm GTSC, which  warned of an attack campaign using the zero-days could lead to remote code execution. Microsoft said the first vulnerability, identified as CVE-2022-41040, is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The second vulnerability – CVE-2022-41082 – allows remote code execution (RCE) when PowerShell is accessible to the attacker.   As of Thursday, Microsoft said it was aware of limited targeted attacks using the two vulnerabilities to get into users’ systems. In these attacks, Microsoft said CVE-2022-41040 can let an authenticated attacker remotely trigger CVE-2022-41082. Microsoft pointed out in its guidance that authenticated access to the vulnerable Exchange Server is necessary to successfully exploit either of the two vulnerabilities. To mitigate potential attacks, Microsoft advised on-premises Microsoft Exchange customers to review and apply the URL Rewrite Instructions it issued in the guidance and block exposed Remote PowerShell ports.  Over the years, Microsoft has become better at responding quickly to serious vulnerabilities, releasing patches outside their usual patch cycle when there’s a severe issue, said Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber. Parkin said hopefully, we’ll see a fast response to these newly revealed vulnerabilities. “They don’t appear to be widespread, yet there are a lot of Exchange servers out there that could be targeted,” Parkin said. “Fortunately, there are workarounds that can blunt the exploit until a patch comes out. Also, this vulnerability only appears to be an issue for the on-premises versions of Exchange and does not affect Exchange Online.” Microsoft has typically responded quickly to these types of events, and in this case, stated they are actively working on a fix, said Travis Smith, vice president of malware threat research at Qualys. Smith said it’s worth noting that we now know that authenticated access to the Exchange server is needed to exploit this vulnerability. He said this reduces the risk, but does not eliminate it.   “Taking a closer look at the information behind the original IPs listed shows that most are from VPN systems,” Smith said. “Only one is from an IP associated with TOR and has malware relationships in VirusTotal. From a security analysis perspective, organizations should first review the malicious TOR IP after searching IIS logs. This is crucial to understanding if you have been compromised.” In a blog post on Friday, GrayNoise lists the information behind the original IPs in greater detail.",microsoft late thursday report investig two report zeroday vulner affect onpremis version microsoft exchang blog issu custom guidanc microsoft said work acceler schedul releas fix two zeroday vulner affect microsoft exchang server vulner first report thursday vietnames secur firm gtsc warn attack campaign use zeroday could lead remot code execut microsoft said first vulner identifi cve serversid request forgeri ssrf vulner second vulner – cve – allow remot code execut rce powershel access attack thursday microsoft said awar limit target attack use two vulner get user system attack microsoft said cve let authent attack remot trigger cve microsoft point guidanc authent access vulner exchang server necessari success exploit either two vulner mitig potenti attack microsoft advis onpremis microsoft exchang custom review appli url rewrit instruct issu guidanc block expos remot powershel port year microsoft becom better respond quick serious vulner releas patch outsid usual patch cycl sever issu said mike parkin senior technic engin vulcan cyber parkin said hope see fast respons newli reveal vulner appear widespread yet lot exchang server could target parkin said fortun workaround blunt exploit patch come also vulner appear issu onpremis version exchang affect exchang onlin microsoft typic respond quick type event case state activ work fix said travi smith vice presid malwar threat research quali smith said worth note know authent access exchang server need exploit vulner said reduc risk elimin take closer look inform behind origin ip list show vpn system smith said one ip associ tor malwar relationship virustot secur analysi perspect organ first review malici tor ip search ii log crucial understand compromis blog post friday graynois list inform behind origin ip greater detail ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'microsoft', 'email', 'data loss', 'flaw']"
15,,Akamai Finds 13 Million Malicious Newly Observed Domains A Month,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33887/Akamai-Finds-13-Million-Malicious-Newly-Observed-Domains-A-Month.html,29/09/2022,"Akamai researchers on Wednesday reported that based on a newly observed domain (NOD) dataset, they have flagged almost 79 million domains as malicious in the first half of 2022. The researchers say this equals approximately 13 million malicious domains per month, representing 20.1% of all the NODs that successfully resolved. In a blog post, the Akamai researchers explained that whenever a domain name is queried for the first time in the last 60 days, the researchers consider it an NOD. The NOD dataset lets the researchers zoom in on the “long tail” of DNS queries. This dataset is where to find freshly registered domain names, typos, and domains that are only very rarely queried on a global scale. NOD data lets Akamai classify a new domain very early in the threat lifecycle. All of its NOD-based detection systems and rules are fully automated. The researchers say that once a new NOD gets identified, the time needed for Akamai to classify it as malicious is measured in minutes — not hours or days. All of this gets done with no human intervention, which lets Akamai mitigate the new DNS threats quickly, according to the researchers. “To put these numbers into context, every month we intercept 13 million domains that are created with malicious purposes that resolve or go somewhere,” said Stijn Tilborghs, a senior data scientist at Akamai. “Based on the data that we see, and with our current heuristic detection system, this equates to 1 in 5 new domains being created for malicious purposes. From a defense perspective, Akamai was able to flag these domains as malicious because of this NOD-based detection system. This allows carriers and ISP's to block these domains."" Matthew Fulmer, manager of cyber intelligence engineering at Deep Instinct, said the data shows a trend that has been increasing exponentially over the past few years: domains are created with the intent of spreading or being used in malicious activities. Fulmer said these activities are often leveraged as a part of code telling a machine where to pull a malicious payload from, developed into a phishing site with the intent of stealing credentials, or even used as a contact point for a command-and-control beacon to report back around connectivity. “These numbers are extremely significant, as looking at the domains in question are random number-letter combinations which amounts to almost a ‘burner’ domain,” Fulmer said. “They are created with the intent of malicious activity, and once they are compromised or classified as malicious, threat actors can just dump them and move to a new domain. For this reason alone, you need to ensure that you have adequate layering in place for your defenses, especially as the rate of false positives was 0.00042% (329 sites out of 79 million).” Muralidharan Palanisamy, chief solutions officer at AppViewX, said Akamai’s detection is based on NODs, which are essentially new DNS domains that appear on the internet. Palanisamy said with existing domains having some history and reputation, identifying whether or not they are secure requires minimal effort. That being said, Palanisamy said there’s a challenge in figuring out whether the new domains are malicious or not. “Akamai’s NOD-based automated detection is a novel approach, where they address and mitigate threats in the DNS layer, way before the connection gets established to impact applications,” Palanisamy said. “Because security is multi-faceted, we have to rely on all weapons in our arsenal to identify the bad actors. Another related approach is Google’s Certificate transparency initiative, which was able to identify and address compromised certificates, domains and certificate authorities. However, with regulatory authorities being compromised and state actors setting up their own regulations, bad actors are able to bypass checks. This is where NODs will help in identifying the new domains that pop up by monitoring and tracking them.” Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at Vulcan Cyber, he’s not surprised that Akamai found so many throwaway malicious domains. Parkin said threat actors are constantly having to create new ones as the old ones are identified and either eliminated from the DNS system or blocked by security gateways. “Ultimately, some form of secure and validated DNS system should become the standard, though there are already a number of tools that will at least provide warnings when a user tries to connect to a suspect domain,” Parkin said.",akamai research wednesday report base newli observ domain nod dataset flag almost million domain malici first half research say equal approxim million malici domain per month repres nod success resolv blog post akamai research explain whenev domain name queri first time last day research consid nod nod dataset let research zoom long tail dns queri dataset find fresh regist domain name typo domain rare queri global scale nod data let akamai classifi new domain earli threat lifecycl nodbas detect system rule fulli autom research say new nod get identifi time need akamai classifi malici measur minut — hour day get done human intervent let akamai mitig new dns threat quick accord research put number context everi month intercept million domain creat malici purpos resolv go somewher said stijn tilborgh senior data scientist akamai base data see current heurist detect system equat new domain creat malici purpos defens perspect akamai abl flag domain malici nodbas detect system allow carrier isp s block domain matthew fulmer manag cyber intellig engin deep instinct said data show trend increas exponenti past year domain creat intent spread use malici activ fulmer said activ often leverag part code tell machin pull malici payload develop phish site intent steal credenti even use contact point commandandcontrol beacon report back around connect number extrem signific look domain question random numberlett combin amount almost ‘ burner domain fulmer said creat intent malici activ compromis classifi malici threat actor dump move new domain reason alon need ensur adequ layer place defens especi rate fals posit site million muralidharan palanisami chief solut offic appviewx said akamai detect base nod essenti new dns domain appear internet palanisami said exist domain histori reput identifi whether secur requir minim effort said palanisami said challeng figur whether new domain malici akamai nodbas autom detect novel approach address mitig threat dns layer way connect get establish impact applic palanisami said secur multifacet reli weapon arsenal identifi bad actor anoth relat approach googl certif transpar initi abl identifi address compromis certif domain certif author howev regulatori author compromis state actor set regul bad actor abl bypass check nod help identifi new domain pop monitor track them mike parkin senior technic engin vulcan cyber surpris akamai found mani throwaway malici domain parkin said threat actor constant creat new one old one identifi either elimin dns system block secur gateway ultim form secur valid dns system becom standard though alreadi number tool least provid warn user tri connect suspect domain parkin said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'dns', 'cybercrime', 'fraud']"
16,,National Data Privacy Proposal May Shape Health Data Not Covered By HIPAA,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33881/National-Data-Privacy-Proposal-May-Shape-Health-Data-Not-Covered-By-HIPAA.html,27/09/2022,"Healthcare stakeholders have long warned of the need for better privacy protection for health data that falls outside the purview of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. If it passes Congress, the American Data Privacy and Protection Act may narrow some of those existing gaps. The ADPA advanced the House Energy and Commerce Committee in July by a vote of 53-2 by and was lauded as a “major step forward” for national data privacy protections. The legislation was advanced aside two other bills seeking stronger federal ransomware reporting and requirements for IoT vendors on surveillance used in consumers’ connected devices. Congressional efforts to create a unified privacy law stalled during the pandemic. But unlike past iterations that were held up by party differences, Deven McGraw, data stewardship & data sharing for Invitae, is hopeful the support from the business community will give the legislation some legs. The legislation is “very comprehensive,” said McGraw. “It’s clearly a serious effort to address privacy issues that arise in what are currently under-regulated spaces. In a healthcare context, we have the HIPAA protections for data but they only apply to data in the hands of certain entities, doctors, hospitals, health plans, and their contracted vendors.” “You have this robust digital health data economy that we're trying to create for the benefit of all of us,” she continued. “And yet, we leave the data largely unprotected, or subject to the commitments made by private companies when we are outside of the HIPAA space.” That means the current environment is rife with confusion for consumers of when data is or isn’t protected outside of HIPAA. Industry groups have long bemoaned gaps in the privacy regulation for health data generated by consumers or through health apps, but the onus for securing data falls on Congress, not the Department of Health and Human Services. The proposed legislation would take major strides in closing these gaps, while giving federal agencies the resources and authority to better regulate data privacy, especially health information. As noted in a recent Politico report, the HHS Office for Civil Rights’ resource challenges makes it difficult to pursue every violation of HIPAA. Few people could understand those challenges better than McGraw, the former deputy director of health information privacy for OCR. On the regulatory side, OCR struggles with “making a dent” in tackling all of the complaints filed against providers and business associates over alleged HIPAA violations and potential cases that could be brought when a clear violation has been found because the agency’s resources “resources are always so constrained.” For example, as HHS nears the enforcement period for its interoperability push to help patients access their own data, a federal privacy bill could ensure consumers aren’t inadvertently storing their data on a platform unregulated by HIPAA or storing it on a social networking site without rigorous privacy protections. The ADPA could give the agency a much needed boost as it gives the Federal Trade Commission more resources and “frankly, more overt and obvious authority to regulate in certain spaces where the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] has struggled a little bit to stretch their existing Section Five authority,” McGraw explained. The concern, however, is that sometimes the authority is challenged and then subjected to potential court rulings that “say they went further than they were supposed to do,” she added. The bill does considerably strengthen the agency’s authority, and it’s “certainly welcomed for the FTC to become more active in the privacy space.” But McGraw warns they can only go as far as their existing authorities allow them to, and “even if they're pushing that envelope a little bit, then there's a possibility they can be overturned.” Overall, arming the FTC with more resources and more authority is a serious win for health data privacy and a “significant step forward.” McGraw is also concerned about how the bill would continue to facilitate the use of health data for research purposes. There is incredibly important medical research that happens with HIPAA’s de-identified data, but “there's a lot of uncertainty about how it could move forward under the bill.”  “HIPAA has long had standards for how data gets de-identified, which, quite frankly, makes it unusual in privacy law,” said McGraw. “They actually have a legal standard to ensure there’s no reasonable basis to believe that the data in the hands of the recipient can be used to re-identify the patient.” There are even two methodologies entities can “use to get data to the point of being deidentified: one requiring the removal of static identifiers and no knowledge that the data can be re-identified. The other is using an X: if you want to leave in data fields that increase the risk of re-identification, then you have to use other techniques to make the data less susceptible to being re-identified,” she explained. These rules have long been understood, which allow data to be linked across datasets, as long the entity couldn’t determine who the patient was. But discrepancies between HIPAA and the ADPA may disrupt these standards, McGraw noted. But there’s hope these elements are “fixable.” It’s important Congress addresses the concerns before the bill is brought to a final vote because it is unlikely to take up the issues again, if passed. “When Congress acts in a really big way, they're often reluctant to go back,” she said. Data privacy challenges exist in all industries, but healthcare’s app challenges have left a largely unregulated space. McGraw notes that data brokers and geolocation data generated by apps are especially problematic. As previously examined, after the upheaval of Roe v. Wade, those privacy gray areas will become an even greater risk to patients. These issues are rooted in the “various aspects of the online universe that we live in today, where you're leaving breadcrumb trails of all the things that you're doing all over the place, and it's very under- regulated,” said McGraw. “In some respects, these categories of sensitive data would receive even further protection that would be put into place by the proposed bill.” “All of that is helpful. Is it sufficient in the post-Dobbs era?” she added. For example, a recent study published in JAMA found that nearly all abortion clinic webpages use third-party trackers that transfer user data. The Dobbs opinion shines a spotlight on the need for this particular bill, but also on another critical issue: Any attempt to create a set of privacy rules primarily based on patient consent won’t necessarily hold up as well when there are law enforcement access exceptions and court-ordered exceptions. “You'll get a better environment, but you won't get the perfect environment,” she added. “Even if the Dobbs’ decision just ratchets up the level of concern to a degree that even HIPAA, frankly, doesn't cover,” particularly in circumstances where the intent of the gathering of the data, or the or a particular use of the data is going to harm someone. In short, we shouldn’t be pinning privacy protections on the patients themselves to protect data. McGraw stressed that infrastructure rules that govern when data can be shared with law enforcement will be most effective. In 2019, Congress made numerous attempts to create a unified federal privacy law focused on giving consumers more control over data, penalizing companies for misusing or under-securing the data in their protection, and, perhaps most importantly, protecting troves of data currently unregulated by HIPAA. At the time, there was a unified consensus that a federal privacy law was needed due to the increase in the patchwork of inconsistent state laws, known to be inefficient in protecting consumers. But the parties were divided on whether the law should supersede state laws. As it stands, in healthcare and across all sectors, businesses must crosswalk a range of state laws and federal regulations to ensure compliance. It’s a hefty task and one that often leaves gaps. By preempting state laws, a federal privacy law like the ADPA would reduce these hurdles and make it easier for businesses to comply. Although the latest privacy push would indeed preempt state laws, McGraw said she believes the prior sticking point won’t be problematic given the support from the business community. The one outlier may be California, as it wants its own statute. The state’s privacy law is well known to be one of the strictest in the country, on par with the EU’s GDPR. However, it’s “not a slam dunk that California is universally stronger across the board.” And even if California has the strongest privacy law in the country, “it doesn’t help the rest of us,” she added. “California's law was passed with a very chaotic, haphazard process in which we have very little enforcement experience to help inform what the challenges are, what works well, what doesn't work so well.” “It does sort of strike me as weakening the argument, in my opinion, for California to be arguing that its law needs to be preserved,” said McGraw. “Take one for the team, sacrifice for the rest of the nation.” Particularly as the concessions would be relatively minute in comparison for what the rest of the country would gain with the proposed legislation.",healthcar stakehold long

17,,Insider Threats Play A Larger Role In Security Incidents,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33871/Insider-Threats-Play-A-Larger-Role-In-Security-Incidents.html,23/09/2022,"Insider threats are becoming an increasingly common part of the attack chain, with malicious insiders and unwitting assets playing critical roles in incidents over the past year, according to Cisco Talos research released Thursday. In a blog post, Cisco Talos researchers said organizations can mitigate these types of risks via education, user-access control, and ensuring proper processes and procedures are in place when and if employees leave the organization. “There are a variety of reasons a user may choose to become a malicious insider, and unfortunately many of them are occurring today,” said the researchers. “Let’s start with the most obvious: financial distress. When a user has a lot of debt, selling the ability to infect their employer can be a tempting avenue. We’ve seen examples of users trying to sell access into employer networks for more than a decade, having spotted them on dark web forums. The current climate, [with the economy tilting toward recession] is ripe for this type of abuse.” Michael DeBolt, chief intelligence officer at Intel 471, said the cybercrime underground remains a hot spot for insider threat recruitment efforts because of the relative anonymity, accessibility, and low barrier of entry it affords. DeBolt said malicious actors use forums and instant messaging platforms to advertise their insider services or, vice versa, to recruit accomplices for specific schemes that require insider access or knowledge. “By far, the most popular motivation for insider threats is financial gain,” DeBolt said. “We have seen examples of financially-motivated threat actors seeking employees at companies to provide data and access to sell in the underground or leverage against the organization or its customers. We also have noted instances where individuals turn to underground forums and instant messaging platforms claiming to be employees at notable organizations to sell company information.”  Dave Gerry, chief operating officer at Bugcrowd, added that while security technology has gotten more sophisticated at attempting to foil attacks, attackers have continued to find the weak link in the security stack. Gerry said this weak link can often be the employees who operate business critical software as they are increasingly under pressure to do more, faster, with fewer resources. “As a security industry, we often see the fundamentals as obvious. However, focusing on training, empowering and encouraging employees to ‘get back to the basics’ is something that continues to be increasingly important,” Gerry said. “Urgent, unusual, or unknown requests for employee records, financial data, or any other type of sensitive information should be flagged with the appropriate security teams for investigation. The simplest way to prevent these types of attacks from being successful is encouraging employees to slow down and ask questions before providing any sort of information that could be used immediately or used in the future to garner more information from someone else.” Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions at Lookout, said insider threats have always been an issue, and with the rapid expansion of corporate infrastructure as reliance on the cloud increases the problem has only gotten more complex. Schless said historically, traditional data loss prevention solutions would sit at a defined security perimeter and monitor all inbound and outbound traffic. The difficulty, explained Schless, is that these tools didn’t have any visibility into how users were interacting with data inside that perimeter, so if a user downloaded a file locally or made certain modifications, the security team might not be alerted.  “Some organizations implemented file integrity monitoring solutions that would keep an eye out for file-level changes, but there were even ways to circumvent that,” Schless said. “While the cloud has enabled us to take massive leaps and bounds in collaboration, scalability, and data access from anywhere it has also introduced more risk. Insiders often have access to far more resources than they actually need to get their job done, which is why attackers have focused so much on phishing employee credentials to kick off their attacks.” Also of note: September is Insider Threat Awareness Month.

18,,ChromeLoader Can Overload Systems With Malware,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33859/ChromeLoader-Can-Overload-Systems-With-Malware.html,20/09/2022,"While initially thought of as a credential-stealing browser hijacker, researchers have found that ChromeLoader has been seen in its newest variants to deliver more malicious malware and used for other nefarious purposes. In a Monday blog post, VMware researchers reported that as recent as late August, ZipBombs have been seen being dropped onto infected systems. A ZipBomb gets dropped with the initial infection in the archive the user downloads and the user must double-click for the ZipBomb to run. The researchers said once run, the malware destroys the user’s system by overloading it with data. The VMware researchers first observed the Windows variants of ChromeLoader in the wild in January 2022 and the macOS version in March 2022. The researchers said there are some variants known to ChromeLoader, including ChromeBack and Choziosi Loader. Unit 42 researchers found evidence of The Real First Windows Variant using the AutoHotKey (AHK) tool to compile a malicious executable and drop version 1.0 of the malware. Although this sort of malware gets created with an intent to feed adware to the user, the researchers also pointed out that ChromeLoader, a browser hijacker that manifests itself as a browser extension, increases the attack surface of an infected system, which can eventually lead to much more devastating attacks, such as ransomware. Browser extensions are a tried-and-true method of attack, as compromising a user's browser can get leveraged by attackers in several ways as evidenced by ChromeLoader's capabilities, said Ryan Kennedy, cybersecurity consultant at nVisium. Kennedy said the malware campaign is still ongoing and continues to present a threat beyond injecting ads into a user's browser. Attackers can leverage it to steal credentials, obtain users' browser history, and potentially take down their system. “Security teams can protect their users by auditing what software users download, and managing users' browsers,” Kennedy said. “Ideally, users should be prevented from downloading untrusted browser extensions, especially those which request access to users' browsing history or other sensitive data in the browser.” Timothy Morris, technology strategist at Tanium, added that browsers have become “endpoints” in their own right. As such, Morris said browser extensions are popular among malware developers. “Users should inspect what extensions are in place and remove those that are not recognized or not used,” Morris said. “Only use those that are absolutely necessary and are trusted. As with all endpoints, make sure your security controls are present and working. Keep browsers up-to-date by patching as quickly as possible once available.”",initi thought credentialst browser hijack research found chromeload seen newest variant deliv malici malwar use nefari purpos monday blog post vmware research report recent late august zipbomb seen drop onto infect system zipbomb get drop initi infect archiv user download user must doubleclick zipbomb run research said run malwar destroy user system overload data vmware research first observ window variant chromeload wild januari maco version march research said variant known chromeload includ chromeback choziosi loader unit research found evid real first window variant use autohotkey ahk tool compil malici execut drop version malwar although sort malwar get creat intent feed adwar user research also point chromeload browser hijack manifest browser extens increas attack surfac infect system eventu lead much devast attack ransomwar browser extens triedandtru method attack compromis user s browser get leverag attack sever way evidenc chromeload s capabl said ryan kennedi cybersecur consult nvisium kennedi said malwar campaign still ongo continu present threat beyond inject ad user s browser attack leverag steal credenti obtain user browser histori potenti take system secur team protect user audit softwar user download manag user browser kennedi said ideal user prevent download untrust browser extens especi request access user brows histori sensit data browser timothi morri technolog strategist tanium ad browser becom endpoint right morri said browser extens popular among malwar develop user inspect extens place remov recogn use morri said use absolut necessari trust endpoint make sure secur control present work keep browser uptod patch quick possibl avail ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'chrome', 'cryptography']"
19,,Shareholders File Suit Against Twitter Following Former CISO's Warnings,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33857/Shareholders-File-Suit-Against-Twitter-Following-Former-CISOs-Warnings.html,20/09/2022,"Shareholders are suing Twitter following a whistleblower complaint and public testimony from former chief information security officer Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, claiming the company deceived investors in public disclosures about the state of their security. The lawsuit, filed Sept. 13, the same day Zatko testified about the security problems in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, names Twitter along with former chief executive officer Jack Dorsey, current CEO Parag Agrawal and chief financial officer Ned Segal as defendants. According to the complaint, the shareholders argue that Twitter knew its security practices were deficient, putting user and advertiser information at risk and cite filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission between 2020 and 2022 that note “security incidents … may expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, increased security costs and potential liability.”  Such a breach — whether actual or perceived — could have a negative impact on the market’s perception of the company’s security posture, harm users and advertisers and decrease trust in the overall product. “Twitter knew about security concerns on their platform; Twitter actively worked to hide the security concerns from the board, the investing public, and regulators; contrary to representations in SEC filings, Twitter did not take steps to improve security; Twitter’s active refusal to address security issues increased the risk of loss of public goodwill; and as a result, Defendants’ statements about Twitter’s business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times,” the complaint states. The bulk of the evidence put forth by the plaintiffs are drawn from Zatko’s whistleblower complaint, which alleged that Twitter’s leadership misled its own board about security vulnerabilities, could not locate much of the data they collected and stored around users and, as a result, needed to provide broad administrative access to software engineers and developers. That left that data exposed to phishing and other credential-based attacks, like the kind that took place in 2020 when teenage hackers were able to hijack an administrative account and take control of high-profile Twitter accounts to advertise a cryptocurrency scam. Zakto also said that the company’s lack of data center redundancy put it at risk of disruptions and shutdowns. The day Zatko’s complaint was made public, Twitter’s stock price dropped by 7%. Further, the shareholders claim that prior to Zatko’s disclosures, Twitter should have already been on notice that its security practices were going to be under scrutiny due to a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission that required it to put a robust information security program around non-public user information and required the company to undergo biennial security audits. “As a result of Defendants’ wrongful acts and omissions, and the precipitous decline in the market value of the Company’s common shares, Plaintiff and other Class members have suffered significant losses and damages,” the complaint states. The core argument by the plaintiffs — that Twitter’s public statements to the SEC and investors demonstrate that they knew deficient security would be bad for business and led to shareholders paying for artificially inflated stock prices — is similar to what SolarWinds shareholders have claimed in their own lawsuit following the massive Orion software supply chain breach that compromised at least nine federal agencies and at least 100 private companies. Earlier this year, a judge declined a request by SolarWinds and its private equity owners to dismiss the suit, saying shareholders had sufficiently demonstrated that CISO Tim Brown and the company acted with “at least, severe recklessness” when touting the company’s security environment in media interviews and public filings. Tyson Benson, an attorney with ZF Group, told SC Media that based on the complaint, the shareholders appear to be arguing that even as Twitter hired Zatko as head of security and were receiving new insights into the porous state of its cybersecurity, the substance in SEC disclosures remained the same, using language this year that was identical to previous years’ filings. One chief difference between this and the SolarWinds lawsuit: whereas SolarWinds argued that there was no proof that previous warnings about security holes made by a consultant prior to the Orion breach made it up to the CEO and other leadership, Zatko was Twitter’s chief security official and his complaint makes it clear his concerns were relayed to the highest levels of the company. “What has happened is because of the Zatko congressional hearing — it put a spotlight on … all of these filings and what the plaintiffs are alleging is, ‘Hey, none of this information found its way into these reportings that are required from SEC — and so because of this active neglect or behavior … that consumers and stock investors were not properly being brought up to date on the actual security environment at Twitter,’” said Benson.   The 2011 consent decree with the FTC may add to that argument and help “set the stage” for shareholders to demonstrate previous bad security, but ultimately Benson said the Twitter lawsuit will need to clear a similar bar, proving that company officials were aware that shortcomings listed in the whistleblower complaint made their previous SEC disclosures inaccurate and that they intended to deceive the government and public with identical statements this year. “What the plaintiffs would be saying is at each time they’re re-using the same statement, and even after Mudge came forward, nothing has changed in this statement,” said Benson. Correction: A previous version of this story misidentified Peiter Zatko as the chief information security officer at Twitter. Zatko was the company's security lead, reporting directly to the CEO.

20,,Vulnerability Allows Access To Credentials In Microsoft Teams,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33848/Vulnerability-Allows-Access-To-Credentials-In-Microsoft-Teams.html,16/09/2022,"Researchers on Tuesday reported that this past August they identified an attack path that lets malicious actors with file system access to steal credentials for any Microsoft Teams user who’s logged-on. In a Sept. 13 blog post, the Vectra Protect team said because attackers do not require elevated permissions to read these files, it exposes this potential concern to any attack that provides malicious actors with local or remote system access. The researchers said this vulnerability impacted all commercial and Government Community Cloud Desktop Team clients for Windows, Mac and Linux. Microsoft has been made aware of this issue and closed the case in late August, stating that it did not meet its bar for immediate servicing. The Vectra researchers said until Microsoft moves to update the Teams Desktop Application, they don’t recommend using the full Teams client and advise customers to consider using the web-based Teams application exclusively. The researchers said security teams should use the web-based Teams client inside Microsoft Edge, which has multiple OS-level controls to protect token leaks. They said the Teams web application is robust and supports most features enabled through the desktop client, keeping the organization’s productivity impacts to a minimum. For customers that must use the installed desktop application, the researchers said it’s critical to watch key application files for access by any processes other than the official Teams application. When asked Thursday if the situation had changed, Aaron Turner, CTO, SaaS Protect at Vectra, said to the Vectra team’s knowledge, Microsoft had not changed its stance. Turner said in Vectra’s interactions with customers, only those organizations with extreme exposure to sophisticated adversaries (defense contractors, critical infrastructure operators) are seriously considering eliminating the Teams.exe application on endpoints and forcing users to collaborate through Teams via a managed browser. Turner said most of the organizations he has talked to plan on implementing an endpoint detection and response monitoring policy to watch for any situations of unauthorized access by a system process to the file storage locations where the tokens are stored. “With hundreds of millions of monthly users, Microsoft Teams has become a significant part of today’s new remote work reality,” Turner said. “As a result of its market share, and the role that the platform plays in both commercial, non-profit and government collaboration, attackers will focus on the entire Teams ecosystem to find ways to compromise identities and gain unauthorized access to data shared through Teams.” Turner added that the work Vectra’s Connor Peoples spearheaded to discover this vulnerability and coordinate his findings with Microsoft is part of Vectra's efforts to help make the Microsoft 365 ecosystem a safer and fairer place for any organization to communicate and collaborate. As outlined in the research, Turner said there are some improvements that Microsoft can make to shore up the Electron application for Windows and MacOS. He said those improvements should also help prevent future vulnerabilities, such as other recently disclosed problems relating to XSS attacks and potential command and control activity using GIFs.  “We echo the guidance from other security researchers that until the Teams Electron application is significantly improved, it is safer to use Microsoft Teams through a managed browser,” said Turner. Sammy Migues, principal scientist at Synopsys Software Integrity Group, said like every application framework, Electron has its own idiosyncrasies related to authentication, secure file storage, and communications. Migues said development teams use frameworks for the same reason they use lots of other open source — it makes their jobs easier and faster. On the other hand, even security-aware teams might not understand what’s really going on in the depths of the framework they’re using. Migues said In this case, it appears that Electron might save some sensitive data in an insecure way. “Note that Electron is no stranger to security issues,” Migues said. “Last month saw another bug in Electron that could cause issues in apps from Microsoft, Discord, BaseCamp, and others. There was also a bug last year. As more people investigate Electron, there will almost certainly be more issues uncovered. Could Electron do more around security? Absolutely. Is it Electron’s fault that application teams use it in certain ways that exposes certain information despite Electron’s limitations? Well, not really.”",research tuesday report past august identifi attack path let malici actor file system access steal credenti microsoft team user loggedon sept blog post vectra protect team said attack requir elev permiss read file expos potenti concern attack provid malici actor local remot system access research said vulner impact commerci govern communiti cloud desktop team client window mac linux microsoft made awar issu close case late august state meet bar immedi servic vectra research said microsoft move updat team desktop applic recommend use full team client advis custom consid use webbas team applic exclus research said secur team use webbas team client insid microsoft edg multipl oslevel control protect token leak said team web applic robust support featur enabl desktop client keep organ product impact minimum custom must use instal desktop applic research said critic watch key applic file access process offici team applic ask thursday situat chang aaron turner cto saa protect vectra said vectra team knowledg microsoft chang stanc turner said vectra interact custom organ extrem exposur sophist adversari defens contractor critic infrastructur oper serious consid elimin teamsex applic endpoint forc user collabor team via manag browser turner said organ talk plan implement endpoint detect respons monitor polici watch situat unauthor access system process file storag locat token store hundr million month user microsoft team becom signific part today new remot work realiti turner said result market share role platform play commerci nonprofit govern collabor attack focus entir team ecosystem find way compromis ident gain unauthor access data share team turner ad work vectra connor peopl spearhead discov vulner coordin find microsoft part vectra s effort help make microsoft ecosystem safer fairer place organ communic collabor outlin research turner said improv microsoft make shore electron applic window maco said improv also help prevent futur vulner recent disclos problem relat x attack potenti command control activ use gif echo guidanc secur research team electron applic signific improv safer use microsoft team manag browser said turner sammi migu princip scientist synopsi softwar integr group said like everi applic framework electron idiosyncrasi relat authent secur file storag communic migu said develop team use framework reason use lot open sourc — make job easier faster hand even securityawar team might understand realli go depth framework use migu said case appear electron might save sensit data insecur way note electron stranger secur issu migu said last month saw anoth bug electron could caus issu app microsoft discord basecamp other also bug last year peopl investig electron almost certain issu uncov could electron around secur absolut electron fault applic team use certain way expos certain inform despit electron limit well realli ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'microsoft', 'flaw', 'password']"
21,,A Quarter Of Cloud Breaches Caused By Unpatched Vulnerabilities,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33843/A-Quarter-Of-Cloud-Breaches-Caused-By-Unpatched-Vulnerabilities.html,15/09/2022,"IBM Security X-Force on Wednesday reported that amid a sixfold increase in new cloud vulnerabilities over the past six years, 26% of cloud compromises that X-Force responded to were caused by attackers exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities. In a blog post, X-Force said the exploitation of unpatched vulnerabilities had become the most common entry point the IBM researchers observed. They also report that in 99% of pen tests, X-Force Red compromised IBM client cloud environments through users’ excess privileges and permissions. The researchers said this was significant because this type of access could let attackers pivot and move laterally across a victim’s environment. Organizations today find it very challenging to patch these new cloud vulnerabilities before they are exploited by attackers, said Claude Mandy, chief evangelist, data security at Symmetry Systems. Mandy said this requires organizations to prioritize which vulnerabilities get patched first, not only find them. “Prioritization of vulnerabilities should consider a number of factors including the severity, existence of public exploits, and accessibility of the vulnerability and the business criticality and sensitivity of the asset and data at risk,” Mandy said. “In the cloud, the complexity and scale quickly becomes unmanageable without use of vulnerability prioritization technology. However even within these technologies, they are unable to map what the impact of an exploited within the broader environment, because a lack of understanding of the data blast radius.""  John Yun, vice president, product strategy at ColorTokens, said it’s clear that organizations are struggling with addressing vulnerabilities in the cloud. Yun said with the rapid pace of adoption, he’s afraid fundamental security hygiene, such as assessing vulnerabilities and applying patches are not being followed with the same level of rigor as on-premises environments. “Cloud workloads with unpatched vulnerabilities are just as susceptible to exploitation as on-premises servers – possibly more so with attackers leveraging the benefits of the cloud ‘s anywhere access,” Yun said. “While many consider OS vulnerabilities the source of this challenge, vulnerabilities from third-party libraries relied on by many applications can pose an even bigger challenge. Regular analysis of the cloud workload for vulnerabilities and assessment in run-time is critical for organizations to identify vulnerabilities and rapidly address possible exploitation and attacks.”",ibm secur xforc wednesday report amid sixfold increas new cloud vulner past six year cloud compromis xforc respond caus attack exploit unpatch vulner blog post xforc said exploit unpatch vulner becom common entri point ibm research observ also report pen test xforc red compromis ibm client cloud environ user excess privileg permiss research said signific type access could let attack pivot move later across victim environ organ today find challeng patch new cloud vulner exploit attack said claud mandi chief evangelist data secur symmetri system mandi said requir organ priorit vulner get patch first find priorit vulner consid number factor includ sever exist public exploit access vulner busi critic sensit asset data risk mandi said cloud complex scale quick becom unmanag without use vulner priorit technolog howev even within technolog unabl map impact exploit within broader environ lack understand data blast radius john yun vice presid product strategi colortoken said clear organ struggl address vulner cloud yun said rapid pace adopt afraid fundament secur hygien assess vulner appli patch follow level rigor onpremis environ cloud workload unpatch vulner suscept exploit onpremis server – possibl attack leverag benefit cloud ‘ anywher access yun said mani consid o vulner sourc challeng vulner thirdparti librari reli mani applic pose even bigger challeng regular analysi cloud workload vulner assess runtim critic organ identifi vulner rapid address possibl exploit attack ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'data loss', 'flaw']"
22,,"FBI: Legacy Medical Devices Pose Risk Of Exploit, Patient Safety Impacts",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33840/FBI-Legacy-Medical-Devices-Pose-Risk-Of-Exploit-Patient-Safety-Impacts.html,14/09/2022,"Cyber threat actors are increasingly exploiting unpatched medical devices operating on outdated software and those with a lack of adequate security features, according to a new FBI private industry notification. An increasing number of vulnerabilities have been identified on these vulnerable devices, where an exploit could impact data integrity and confidentiality, in addition to causing disruptions in operational functions and impacting patient safety. For industry leaders, many of the listed medical device security risks may be familiar: hardware design and software management vulnerabilities, the use of standardized or specialized configurations, missing embedded security features, and the inability to upgrade those features.  Further, some devices leverage customized software that requires special upgrading or patching procedures, which only compounds existing delays with patching in the healthcare environment. There is also the ecosystem to consider, often complex with a substantial number of devices. “Medical device hardware often remains active for 10 to 30 years, however, underlying software life cycles are specified by the manufacturer, ranging from a couple months to maximum life expectancy per device allowing cyber threat actors time to discover and exploit vulnerabilities,” the alert reminds healthcare entities For the FBI, the leading concerns center around legacy devices and the reliance on outdated software due to the lack of support, patches, or updates from manufacturers. As such, many devices are particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Threat actors can easily exploit devices using default configurations and those not initially designed with security in mind. Citing several studies remarking on the prevalence of the targeting of devices, including insulin pumps, the FBI is urging healthcare providers to “actively secure medical devices, identify vulnerabilities, and increase employee awareness reporting.” For John Riggi, American Hospital Association’s national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, the alert reiterates the need for Congress to pass the PATCH Act, lauded by industry stakeholders as an effort that would ensure medical device manufacturers implement increased cybersecurity requirements for their products to address longstanding reliance on outdated legacy tech. Device vulnerabilities pose “a significant cyber risk to hospitals. In 2017, the FBI reported that the North Korean WannaCry global healthcare ransomware attack was fueled by vulnerabilities in medical devices,” Riggi said in a statement. The PATCH Act would address many of the risks and vulnerabilities outlined in the FBI alert, requiring manufacturers to “monitor and identify post-market vulnerabilities in a timely manner, develop a plan for coordinated vulnerability disclosure, provide lifetime cybersecurity support of the device and provide an accounting of all software contained in the device,” he added. While awaiting the progress from the proposed bill, healthcare entities should ensure their business associate agreements with medical device and tech vendors have bolstered cybersecurity requirements, explained Riggi. The Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council shared a guide to medical technology model contract language in March. The FBI recommendations outlined in its industry notice can support provider organizations with the needed policies and security measures to better defend against these common risks. The recommendations are broken down into endpoint protection, asset management, identity and access management, employee training, and vulnerability management.  Healthcare entities are also encouraged to provide the FBI with feedback on the medical device insights.",cyber threat actor increas exploit unpatch medic devic oper outdat softwar lack adequ secur featur accord new fbi privat industri notif increas number vulner identifi vulner devic exploit could impact data integr confidenti addit caus disrupt oper function impact patient safeti industri leader mani list medic devic secur risk may familiar hardwar design softwar manag vulner use standard special configur miss embed secur featur inabl upgrad featur devic leverag custom softwar requir special upgrad patch procedur compound exist delay patch healthcar environ also ecosystem consid often complex substanti number devic medic devic hardwar often remain activ year howev under softwar life cycl specifi manufactur rang coupl month maximum life expect per devic allow cyber threat actor time discov exploit vulner alert remind healthcar entiti fbi lead concern center around legaci devic relianc outdat softwar due lack support patch updat manufactur mani devic particular vulner cyberattack threat actor easili exploit devic use default configur initi design secur mind cite sever studi remark preval target devic includ insulin pump fbi urg healthcar provid activ secur medic devic identifi vulner increas employe awar report john riggi american hospit associ nation advisor cybersecur risk alert reiter need congress pas patch act laud industri stakehold effort would ensur medic devic manufactur implement increas cybersecur requir product address longstand relianc outdat legaci tech devic vulner pose signific cyber risk hospit fbi report north korean wannacri global healthcar ransomwar attack fuel vulner medic devic riggi said statement patch act would address mani risk vulner outlin fbi alert requir manufactur monitor identifi postmarket vulner time manner develop plan coordin vulner disclosur provid lifetim cybersecur support devic provid account softwar contain devic ad await progress propos bill healthcar entiti ensur busi associ agreement medic devic tech vendor bolster cybersecur requir explain riggi healthcar public health sector coordin council share guid medic technolog model contract languag march fbi recommend outlin industri notic support provid organ need polici secur measur better defend common risk recommend broken endpoint protect asset manag ident access manag employe train vulner manag healthcar entiti also encourag provid fbi feedback medic devic insight ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'flaw', 'fbi']"
23,,"Mudge: Lack Of Access, Data Controls Invite Twitter Exploitation",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33838/Mudge-Lack-Of-Access-Data-Controls-Invite-Twitter-Exploitation.html,14/09/2022,"Twitter’s logging, access and data controls are so poor that they practically invite exploitation by hackers, insider threats, disinformation agents and foreign spies, according to former chief information security officer and whistleblower Peiter “Mudge” Zatko. In testimony to Congress, Zatko, a well-respected information security professional with a decades-long record of advocating for better security policy in the public and private sectors, said Tuesday that after joining Twitter as its CISO in November 2020 and speaking to engineers and employees, he realized the company was “more than a decade behind industry security standards.” In particular, Twitter’s data infrastructure is so decentralized that not even leadership knows all the data the company collects or where it’s stored. When he brought those concerns to Twitter’s leadership, he claimed their incentive structure led them to prioritize “profits over security.” “First, they don’t know what data they have, where it lives, or where it came from and so unsurprisingly, they can’t protect it. That leads to the second problem: employees need to have too much access to too much data on too many systems,” Zatko told the Senate Judiciary Committee. Additionally, Twitter has repeatedly dealt with foreign governments bribing or enticing employees to hand over user data. In 2019, two employees were charged with acting as illegal foreign agents of Saudi Arabia, passing over sensitive user data on critics and dissidents of the royal family in exchange for money, and Zatko said the company’s also dealt with at least one Chinese foreign agent inside the company. He also said in his time as CISO, he observed at least one instance where a likely foreign agent from India was placed inside the company to gain access to information related to Twitter’s ongoing negotiations with Indian government officials over requests to ban certain accounts and content. He also recalled routinely seeing Twitter account credentials listed for sale on the dark web. But the status quo at Twitter and preoccupation of leadership with growth and managing other public crises meant the company “simply lacked the fundamental abilities to hunt for foreign intelligence agencies and expel them on their own.” In the case of the Indian agent, he said he had to task a small internal team to develop the protocols needed to track and monitor just that one individual, a solution that isn’t scalable to Twitter’s larger employee base. The value of such access is so great and easy to gain that he surmised any foreign country not attempting to place agents inside the company wasn’t doing its job. ""From my understanding from people in the [intelligence] community who focus on foreign intelligence organizations and assets, if you placed somebody in Twitter…it would be very difficult for Twitter to find them, they would probably be able to stay there for a long period of time and gain a significant amount of information to provide back on either targeting people or information as to Twitter's decisions and discussions and as to the direction of the company,"" said Zatko. When asked what data the company tends to collect on the average user, Zatko cited a user's phone numbers, their latest IP address, other IP addresses, their current email, prior emails, where they think the user lives, where they are currently connecting from, what language they speak, the type of device are they connected with, their web browser, and possibly their type of computer. Twitter executives have denied Zatko's claims, and after his whistleblower complaint was made public, a company spokesperson said he was fired in January for ""ineffective leadership and poor performance."" According to the Wall Street Journal, the company paid Zatko $7 million in a settlement prior to his submission of the complaint. Questions and a request for comment sent to Twitter's press office were not immediately returned. Committee chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., made the case that Twitter’s infrastructure is too important to leave user data unsecured, likening it to customers giving their money to a bank who then leaves the vault “wide open.” He referenced a widely reported 2020 incident where two young hackers spear phished Twitter employees over the phone, posing as IT support to gain administrative access that allowed them to take over a number of high-profile accounts, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden, former President Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Michael Bloomberg and others. The potential for damage, Durbin argued, could have been far greater. “We’ve already seen what can happen when small-time hackers break into Twitter accounts belonging to government officials, but what if next time it isn’t two teenagers trying to pull a crypto scam?” said Durbin. “Imagine if it’s a malicious hacker or a hostile foreign government breaking into the President’s twitter account, or sending out false information claiming there as a terrorist attack on one of our cities? We could see widespread panic.” The failure to safeguard user information was already the subject of a 2011 consent decree the company agreed to with the Federal Trade Commission. However, Zatko said that FTC enforcement (usually in the form of one time fines) are viewed as toothless compared to regulation from other countries, like France, and his testimony indicated that the company hasn’t introduced the necessary safeguards to prevent a similar attack from succeeding in the future. “It’s not far-fetched to say that an employee at the company could take over the accounts of all of the senators in this room,” he said. “Given the real harm to users and national security I determined it was necessary to take on the professional and personal risk to myself and my family of becoming a whistleblower.”",twitter log access data control poor practic invit exploit hacker insid threat disinform agent foreign spi accord former chief inform secur offic whistleblow peiter mudg zatko testimoni congress zatko wellrespect inform secur profession decadeslong record advoc better secur polici public privat sector said tuesday join twitter ciso novemb speak engin employe realiz compani decad behind industri secur standard particular twitter data infrastructur decentr even leadership know data compani collect store brought concern twitter leadership claim incent structur led priorit profit secur first know data life came unsurpris protect lead second problem employe need much access much data mani system zatko told senat judiciari committe addit twitter repeat dealt foreign govern bribe entic employe hand user data two employe charg act illeg foreign agent saudi arabia pass sensit user data critic dissid royal famili exchang money zatko said compani also dealt least one chines foreign agent insid compani also said time ciso observ least one instanc like foreign agent india place insid compani gain access inform relat twitter ongo negoti indian govern offici request ban certain account content also recal routin see twitter account credenti list sale dark web status quo twitter preoccup leadership growth manag public crisi meant compani simpli lack fundament abil hunt foreign intellig agenc expel own case indian agent said task small intern team develop protocol need track monitor one individu solut scalabl twitter larger employe base valu access great easi gain surmis foreign countri attempt place agent insid compani job understand peopl intellig communiti focus foreign intellig organ asset place somebodi twitter…it would difficult twitter find would probabl abl stay long period time gain signific amount inform provid back either target peopl inform twitter s decis discuss direct compani said zatko ask data compani tend collect averag user zatko cite user s phone number latest ip address ip address current email prior email think user life current connect languag speak type devic connect web browser possibl type comput twitter execut deni zatko s claim whistleblow complaint made public compani spokesperson said fire januari ineffect leadership poor perform accord wall street journal compani paid zatko million settlement prior submiss complaint question request comment sent twitter s press offic immedi return committe chair dick durbin dill made case twitter infrastructur import leav user data unsecur liken custom give money bank leaf vault wide open referenc wide report incid two young hacker spear phish twitter employe phone pose support gain administr access allow take number highprofil account includ thenpresidenti candid joe biden former presid barack obama elon musk michael bloomberg other potenti damag durbin argu could far greater alreadi seen happen smalltim hacker break twitter account belong govern offici next time two teenag tri pull crypto scam said durbin imagin malici hacker hostil foreign govern break presid twitter account send fals inform claim terrorist attack one citi could see widespread panic failur safeguard user inform alreadi subject consent decre compani agre feder trade commiss howev zatko said ftc enforc usual form one time fine view toothless compar regul countri like franc testimoni indic compani introduc necessari safeguard prevent similar attack succeed futur farfetch say employe compani could take account senat room said given real harm user nation secur determin necessari take profession person risk famili becom whistleblow ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'twitter']"
24,,Lawsuit After KeyBank Breach Heralds Changes In Liability,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33831/Lawsuit-After-KeyBank-Breach-Heralds-Changes-In-Liability.html,13/09/2022,"Just days after KeyBank publicly announced late last Friday that an untold number of its mortgage customers had their information stolen, the Cleveland-based financial institution was slapped with a lawsuit that claims both the bank and a third-party service provider were negligent in monitoring and controlling potential IT security issues. If this federal court case proceeds, and gains class-action status that the litigants are seeking, it could further alter already evolving compliance and liability concerns for banks and other U.S. financial institutions that get hacked — putting more responsibility on them to be proactive and thorough in their IT security efforts. The lawsuit might also delve deeper into the legalities and compliance issues when bad actors attack a financial institution through an outside vendor, as was the apparent case with the recent KeyBank hack. While KeyBank would not verify the number of affected customers, the federal lawsuit claimed that it exceeded at least 100 people in various states and, by its accounting, damages already amount to more than $5 million for affected customers, not including interest and some other costs. With $187 billion in assets and operating in 15 states, KeyBank, the main subsidiary of KeyCorp, is one of the 25 largest banks in the country. “Unfortunately, instead of well thought out cyber-defense strategies, the driving force behind cybersecurity efforts may be negligence lawsuits,” said Jeff Williams, co-founder and chief technology officer at Contrast Security. According to the lawsuit citing the bank’s own annual report, the bank earned $131 million in consumer mortgage income last year, “suggesting a large number of loans [were] originated and/or serviced by the defendants,” the lawsuit alleged. The lawsuit also claimed that despite recent notification of the potential compromise, many KeyBank customers “have already been subjected to violations of their privacy and have been exposed to a heightened and imminent risk of fraud and identity theft. Potentially impacted KeyBank customers were notified of the breach in a letter on Aug. 26. The Midwestern super-regional bank released a statement the Friday before the Labor Day weekend, verifying that an unnamed number of the bank’s home mortgage borrowers had their personal data compromised when the bank’s insurance service provider, Overby-Seawell Company (OSC), was hacked in early July. “We take this matter very seriously and have notified all affected individuals,” the bank’s recent statement said. The bank reported that vender OSC informed the FBI about the breach, and the insurance servicer had already brought in outside cybersecurity experts to investigate. In the late August letter, KeyBank said that OSC would cover expenses for the bank’s affected mortgage borrowers to have Equifax identity protection service for two years. The bank maintained in its recent statement that it was not made aware of the July 5 OSC breach until a month later, on Aug. 4. Compromised mortgage-holder data was said to potentially include property addresses, bank account numbers, insurance account policy numbers, insurance account information, phone numbers and the first eight digits of Social Security numbers. However, cybersecurity experts, the legal community and bank customers have questioned that handing out identity protection coverage to customers may be too little, too late. For its part, the lawsuit, which emerged quickly compared to other financial breach-related litigation, has claimed that KeyBank and its vendor OSC were negligent by not doing enough to monitor, inspect and control their own IT security. While Williams pointed out that “in the real world, it’s possible for banks to get robbed despite elaborate security defenses... [but] in cyberspace, at least according to the KeyBank lawsuit, any breach must mean that the defendant has 'unreasonably deficient data security measures and protocols.'” In the past couple of years, more financial companies are not only admitting to having been breached, but litigation and regulatory actions are emerging with greater frequency. And increasingly they have alleged that these financial institutions, and often their outside service providers, are not doing enough to stem the tide of financial cyber threats. Indeed, previous settlements in financial data-breach cases have included: Capital One, which paid out $190 million to affected customers and $80 million to settle regulatory actions; Morgan Stanley, which paid $120 million, including civil penalties paid to regulators; and Equifax, which was forced to pay $700 million to settle claims by customers and regulators. “We will continue to see negligence lawsuits decided by woefully unprepared judges for the foreseeable future,” Williams said. “The results are going to be wildly unpredictable… and lead to bad precedent.” The crux of the problem, Williams added, is that while there are “a litany of cybersecurity standards that definitely can be used by plaintiffs to establish a duty of care ...  there are virtually no companies that fully meet these standards.” Case in point: The OWASP Top Ten, written by Williams himself 20 years ago and “updated many times, was intended to establish a 'low-water mark' for application security. But [it] is almost never met.”",day keybank public announc late last friday untold number mortgag custom inform stolen clevelandbas financi institut slap lawsuit claim bank thirdparti servic provid neglig monitor control potenti secur issu feder court case proceed gain classact status litig seek could alter alreadi evolv complianc liabil concern bank u financi institut get hack — put respons proactiv thorough secur effort lawsuit might also delv deeper legal complianc issu bad actor attack financi institut outsid vendor appar case recent keybank hack keybank would verifi number affect custom feder lawsuit claim exceed least peopl various state account damag alreadi amount million affect custom includ interest cost billion asset oper state keybank main subsidiari keycorp one largest bank countri unfortun instead well thought cyberdefens strategi drive forc behind cybersecur effort may neglig lawsuit said jeff william cofound chief technolog offic contrast secur accord lawsuit cite bank annual report bank earn million consum mortgag incom last year suggest larg number loan origin andor servic defend lawsuit alleg lawsuit also claim despit recent notif potenti compromis mani keybank custom alreadi subject violat privaci expos heighten immin risk fraud ident theft potenti impact keybank custom notifi breach letter aug midwestern superregion bank releas statement friday labor day weekend verifi unnam number bank home mortgag borrow person data compromis bank insur servic provid overbyseawel compani osc hack earli juli take matter serious notifi affect individu bank recent statement said bank report vender osc inform fbi breach insur servic alreadi brought outsid cybersecur expert investig late august letter keybank said osc would cover expens bank affect mortgag borrow equifax ident protect servic two year bank maintain recent statement made awar juli osc breach month later aug compromis mortgagehold data said potenti includ properti address bank account number insur account polici number insur account inform phone number first eight digit social secur number howev cybersecur expert legal communiti bank custom question hand ident protect coverag custom may littl late part lawsuit emerg quick compar financi breachrel litig claim keybank vendor osc neglig enough monitor inspect control secur william point real world possibl bank get rob despit elabor secur defens cyberspac least accord keybank lawsuit breach must mean defend unreason defici data secur measur protocol past coupl year financi compani admit breach litig regulatori action emerg greater frequenc increas alleg financi institut often outsid servic provid enough stem tide financi cyber threat inde previous settlement financi databreach case includ capit one paid million affect custom million settl regulatori action morgan stanley paid million includ civil penalti paid regul equifax forc pay million settl claim custom regul continu see neglig lawsuit decid woefulli unprepar judg forese futur william said result go wild unpredictable… lead bad preced crux problem william ad litani cybersecur standard definit use plaintiff establish duti care virtual compani fulli meet standard case point owasp top ten written william year ago updat mani time intend establish lowwat mark applic secur almost never met ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'bank', 'data loss', 'fraud']"
25,,Who Owns Digital Health Data? HIPPA Privacy Myths May Put Women At Risk,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33828/Who-Owns-Digital-Health-Data-HIPPA-Privacy-Myths-May-Put-Women-At-Risk.html,12/09/2022,"For women, privacy and control over health information has never been more important, as the U.S. continues its abortion access fight and as some states criminalize the procedure. But beyond the political debate, knowledge gaps on the actual protections for and control of digital health data may lead to severe consequences. Several reports within the last few months have furthered these digital health privacy concerns, including two showing Facebook’s Pixel tool allegedly scraping hospital data. The Novant Health ACE breach notice that soon followed the report seemed to confirm the dubious practices as 1.4 million patients were told of an “unintended disclosure” via the Meta tool. During the same time period, reports out of Nebraska showed Facebook was issued a subpoena compelling it to release private communications with law enforcement over illegal abortion claims against a 41-year-old woman and her daughter. Kayte Spector-Bagdady, JD, an associate director at the University of Michigan Medical School’s Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine, says it’s the latter scenario that should be of prime concern to women under the current abortion climate, in combination with misconceptions about digital health control and privacy. Click here for full coverage of the 2022 Women in IT Security. Spector-Bagdady is a clinical ethicist and leads in other academic roles. She was also the former associate director for the Obama administration’s presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics. She mused, “this is the moment.” The Facebook scenarios bring up several different regulatory regimes. While Spector-Bagdady has no personal knowledge of the report on the company’s alleged data scraping, if appointment information, health concerns, and personal names were indeed pulled by the app, it could be a violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. HIPAA regulates identifying data like names combined with health information, like the kind of appointment you need. She added that in a traditional sense it “should indeed be protected by HIPAA.” In light of these reports, extensive nuances, and the criminalization of abortion in some states, SC Media spoke with Spector-Bagdady on the current state of digital health privacy and controls to disbunk key myths and find ways to protect providers, and their patients. Those in healthcare are keenly aware of the limitations of HIPAA: that it only applies to specific covered entities and business associates and its outdated nature limits its controls over consumer-generated data and health app developers. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 national emergency revealed the chasm between privacy perceptions around health data and actuality. Consumers tend to believe they have more control over their own health information than they actually do, said Spector-Bagdady. “Health information is only protected by federal law under very narrow and specific circumstances.” For example, when stores were asking people to present their vaccination card before entering, people were concerned about their HIPAA rights. But it clearly wasn’t a violation as the rule applies only to healthcare entities and not private businesses and no one else. In addition, if the health data lacks some very specific identifying information, like the full name or Social Security number, the information “can be shared pretty freely.” Spector-Bagdady stressed that HIPAA’s main protection is for clinical information.  “Even our de-identified clinical information doesn't have HIPAA protection,” she said. De-identified data is still defined by the regulation, which was drafted in the 1990s. As a result, it “doesn't at all govern commercial gathering or use of health information or health proxy information.  “There are almost no protections under HIPAA or any other data privacy regulation in the U.S. to protect against a state law enforcement, subpoenaing, or discovery requests or any other kind of law enforcement technique to gather information because there are huge exceptions in HIPAA for criminal law enforcement requests,” Spector-Bagdady continued. These myths around how health information is protected may lead consumers to share more information than they intended. These misconceptions and the gaps in HIPAA gaps raise numerous privacy and safety red flags and put women, and perhaps providers, at risk of legal action in states where the practice has been criminalized. To Spector-Bagdady, there are two big data issues people don’t understand: the data mosaic and how much health proxy data they're leaving behind as they go through their day-to-day activities.  For example, if someone visits their local pharmacy and uses their pharmacy discount card or credit card every time they check out, or buy tampons the same time every month, and one month, they buy a pregnancy test and no tampons. If they start buying tampons again two months later, that’s likely “health proxy information that can be discoverable and used against them in a criminal case.” The data mosaic refers to people feeling able to share their personal information on Facebook, professional information on Twitter, or information about who you want to date on Tinder. “People aren't thinking about these companies that are gathering all of those data together, which paints a much more complete picture of people,” she explained. People need to know not to “rely on private companies to protect information they feel is personal.” “You should never trust that a conversation you have on Facebook or a conversation that you have and the direct messages of Twitter to be ultimately completely private,” said Spector Bagdady. “Disconcertingly in the space, even when you're talking to your doctor, if what you're talking about is criminal in your state: they can still attempt to discover those conversations.” Further, it’s become increasingly clear that there are many ways to identify data that has been “de-identified” under the HIPAA standard. “For example, if somebody has my geolocation data, I am the only person on the face of the earth that goes from my house to my office and back every single day,” said Spector-Bagdady.  The combination of geolocation data to other kinds of data shared on the device, like weight tracking and adding it it other geolocation data, “like visiting an abortion clinic, you suddenly get a very vivid picture, not only of who I am as a person, but some health information about me.” This precise scenario has driven several congressional investigations and proposals, as well as legal actions by the FTC against data brokers allegedly selling health information. A classic example of this is period tracker apps. People put in information about when they have sexual intercourse, when they have their period, when they don't have their period, how they're feeling, she explained. There have been past exposes that show some of those period tracker apps, at least in some point in time, were sharing that data directly to Facebook. That kind of information and data sharing can reveal really personal information, like that kind of data sharing can reveal really personal information, like when you were not pregnant, when you stopped having your period and then when you started having your period again. “We haven't traditionally identified that as sort of HIPAA-protected, abortion care-related information. But states that are criminalizing performance of or access to an abortion can then use those data to support criminal allegations,” said Spector-Bagdady. The reports on the law enforcement actions in Nebraska spotlight data control concerns, where Facebook was compelled to share private messages between a mother and a daughter with criminal law enforcement. Spector-Bagdady notes it’s a completely different situation from simply scraping data or tracking geo-location data to build user profiles because it’s “in the world of commercial health information.” The reports centered on “health proxy information,” not records held by a doctor, but a person “talking about their health information in what an assumed private conversation.” “There are many exceptions to any sort of privacy when law enforcement requests those records,” said Spector-Bagdady. “To some extent, it's almost up to the private companies with how much they're going to fight against those subpoenas and requests for information.” While she does not have personal knowledge about Facebook’s relationship with law enforcement and what legally occurred, there are companies that have “been very clearly aggressive in pushing against that kind of warrant for information.” Similar issues arose years ago, when the FBI asked Apple to unlock a phone of the suspected San Bernadino killer. In more recent years, it’s an issue 23andme has been quite public about: sharing how frequently law enforcement requests data from them and how many times they've actually been forced to give the data to them after fighting.  Consumers need to be better aware of the current state of data, privacy, and control. As Spector-Bagdady notes, “people see things like Facebook and Twitter as a public forum or even a private place to have personal conversations, and they're owned by private companies.” “There are all these exceptions that people just don't even realize,” she added. A June JAMA article written by Spector-Bagdady and Michelle Mello, a leading empirical health law scholar with a joint appointment at the Stanford University School of Medicine in the Department of Medicine, outlines the importance of clinicians speaking with patients about online privacy, particularly when it comes to reproductive health and in the current climate. Although Spector-Bagdady stressed that “we always put so much on our first-line practitioners.” However, in states where abortion has been criminalized, “it's critical for clinicians to be having that discussion. It’s also time to remind clinicians not to record unnecessary medical information” as there is a lot of information shared, some of which could be extraneous. “This is a place we should revisit: what actually needs to be written down in the medical record, such that we can take good continuous care of a patient over the long term, versus what is speculation and potentially not necessary or helpful for that patient,” she added. For clinicians, currently stuck in this untenable situation, Spector-Bagdady stressed the importance of relying on phone calls for those complicated conversations, as they “can’t be discovered.” Email is one of those challenging areas, particularly as people may use work email as a private email, which is owned by their employer — including the information stored in the account. And “even if you're using personal devices or personal email, if you are subject to the Freedom of Information Act because you're a publicly funded institution, you are subject to state laws.” These are important elements for clinicians to consider around data, but there are obvious concerns held by Spector-Bagdady and others for states where abortion is now considered a crime. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) adds another complication for providers, where they must stabilize patients even if that includes abortion care and in a state where abortion is potentially criminalized.  “The hospital is looking at civil liability from the feds, and the clinician is looking at criminal liability from the state,” Spector-Bagdady. But unlike civil liability, my hospital can't go to jail for me. My hospital can say, ‘do the right thing, and if you get sued, we'll protect you and pay civil penalties’ but the hospital can’t go to jail for someone.” “Clinicians are being put in these horrific positions where they might actually be in a moment where they have to decide whether to potentially provide life saving abortion care when they might risk being charged with criminal effects,” Spector-Bagdady. “That's not our clinicians’ burden to bear. That is the fault of our court system and our legislators.”",woman privaci control health inform never import u continu abort access fight state crimin procedur beyond polit debat knowledg gap actual

26,,Effective Access Controls Key To Employing Zero Trust In Healthcare,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33824/Effective-Access-Controls-Key-To-Employing-Zero-Trust-In-Healthcare.html,"/09/9,","Zero trust, the process of narrowing defense perimeters to more individualized resources, is an ideal model for the modern threat landscape. But in healthcare, key challenges with expansive inventory and the need for ready access may inhibit the shift to stronger access controls. To Zach Martin, senior policy advisor for Venable, zero trust in healthcare can be achieved by foundational policies that maintain effective device and application security, along with addressing how the tech integrates with the existing identity and access management system. “Zero trust is difficult, no matter the market,” said Martin, who authored the Health-ISAC’s recent white paper delving into the nuances of zero trust in healthcare. “It’s the architecture and other elements that are different than people are used to.” Traditionally, the mindset was that firewalls were the pinnacle of security. But modern security requires a more nuanced approach. “It’s tough,” said Martin. ”You can get the most well-funded, well-resourced organization, and you'll still have challenges in implementing zero-trust architecture.” Martin has been working with the Health-ISAC’s identity committee for several months as an advisor. Provider organizations have been asking more about zero trust and how it applies to the healthcare environment, its feasibility, and some of the specific healthcare challenges. The white paper aims to address those key areas. “You’re not going to implement zero trust overnight,” said Martin. “It’s not the way this works. You have to take a phased approach” that begins with verifying the tech operating on the network, the policies to support identity and security, and the current authorizations and user privileges. In short, providers must ask “a lot of foundational questions” before talking with vendors or consultants to begin the key implementation elements outlined in the Health-ISAC paper. Only after the information is gathered around device inventory, applications, integration, and the role of multi-factor authentication can providers take the next step of discussing next steps with their identity and access management and clinical application vendors to examine the scope of options specific to their organization. Stakeholders often note the difficulties in employing MFA in healthcare due to the complexity of the environment, the sheer number of access points, and concerns about further burdening providers who need efficient access to ensure patient care. “It’s a complicated thing because you don't want to make caregivers jump through extra hoops in order to get access to bring care to patients,” said Martin. But there are other ways to employ strong authentication outside of traditional plug-in tech, OTP, or biometrics, he explained. There are other environmental or other attributes that can perform similar authentication controls, such as geolocation of the IP address or device information. And that’s where policy comes into play: Is the person caring for this patient actually in the hospital? Are they accessing the services from a Wi-Fi sensor located on the floor near the patient? Through risk engines and other environmental attributes to determine user profiles and authenticate, leaders can block access when a user is trying to access a patient health record from an IP address based in another country or at a time of day the user is typically off-work.  Without the right policies, these red flags can be overlooked. “There are all sorts of other things that can be used outside of traditional MFA when it can't be deployed,” said Martin. However, MFA can be achieved in a way “that’s seamless to the end user” that doesn't require users to bring out a phone, hit a button on their device, or take off their gloves to do biometric authentication. Provider organizations need to have the policies in place that backup or support whatever technology they plan to eventually deploy, such as MFA implementation or least privilege. Those elements begin on paper, and it’s a requirement for providers who want to begin the zero-trust journey long before implementing the technology. Modern identity and access management systems can support authorization and least privilege. As Martin noted: “It's just a matter of implementing the tech and putting the elements in place.” Healthcare has a number of different applications that are out there, so security leaders are tasked with ensuring the implemented tools “can integrate with a centralized management system” that can monitor and leverage fine-grained authorization, “so if there's something suspicious happening, it can be blocked out.” “Zero trust isn't necessarily going to work for every single market or every single organization, but it's something to consider,” said Martin. But even if a provider organization isn’t able to complete the full journey into the security model, bolstering access to various applications and tools is paramount. And there are elements to zero trust, particularly around access management, which can go a long way even when alternative processes can’t be achieved. For Martin, healthcare entities considering a zero-trust journey should first pilot the model in an office setting to determine whether it’s a feasible capability for a broad, more complex caregiver environment. A small pilot program can determine the possibilities, what works for the organization, and whether a broader program can be achieved. At the end of the day, key challenges with procurement and IoT devices may hinder the process. But that doesn’t mean security leaders shouldn’t begin to chip away at these issues. With IoT device security, it again boils down to policies. Providers need to strengthen and evaluate their inventory of devices on the network and ensure authentication is possible and that users are authorized. For example, “the wireless telecom device caregivers wear around their necks shouldn't be able to escalate their privileges to where they're able to access patient information,” he explained. The majority of attacks stem from elevated privileges, strong user profiles and policies can reduce those risks. Device procurement is another area with policy-based solutions. Martin stressed that entities should have a policy that requires all buying decisions for software and tools to meet established security requirements and ensure devices are procured from reputable vendors that can support a zero-trust architecture. “It's a matter of not buying something because it looks cool and could work. It's also making sure that it meets the security requirements on the back end,” said Martin. That way leaders don’t inadvertently open “a backdoor that enables somebody to do something they shouldn't be doing.” Organizations must talk to their current vendors and consultants to determine their current capabilities and then “figure out how to change” current policies and perhaps tech to improve the current state of authorization and access challenges. “Fine-grained authorization” is possible in healthcare. But it starts with policy. In a key example, it begins with user access and ensuring that clinicians and other workforce members only have access to the information needed to perform their role. It’s an issue often overlooked in the healthcare environment.",zero trust process narrow defens perimet individu resourc ideal model modern threat landscap healthcar key challeng expans inventori need readi access may inhibit shift stronger access control zach martin senior polici advisor venabl zero trust healthcar achiev foundat polici maintain effect devic applic secur along address tech integr exist ident access manag system zero trust difficult matter market said martin author healthisac recent white paper delv nuanc zero trust healthcar architectur element differ peopl use to tradit mindset firewal pinnacl secur modern secur requir nuanc approach tough said martin get wellfund wellresourc organ ll still challeng implement zerotrust architectur martin work healthisac ident committe sever month advisor provid organ ask zero trust appli healthcar environ feasibl specif healthcar challeng white paper aim address key area go implement zero trust overnight said martin way work take phase approach begin verifi tech oper network polici support ident secur current author user privileg short provid must ask lot foundat question talk vendor consult begin key implement element outlin healthisac paper inform gather around devic inventori applic integr role multifactor authent provid take next step discuss next step ident access manag clinic applic vendor examin scope option specif organ stakehold often note difficulti employ mfa healthcar due complex environ sheer number access point concern burden provid need effici access ensur patient care complic thing nt want make caregiv jump extra hoop order get access bring care patient said martin way employ strong authent outsid tradit plugin tech otp biometr explain environment attribut perform similar authent control geoloc ip address devic inform polici come play person care patient actual hospit access servic wifi sensor locat floor near patient risk engin environment attribut determin user profil authent leader block access user tri access patient health record ip address base anoth countri time day user typic offwork without right polici red flag overlook sort thing use outsid tradit mfa ca nt deploy said martin howev mfa achiev way seamless end user nt requir user bring phone hit button devic take glove biometr authent provid organ need polici place backup support whatev technolog plan eventu deploy mfa implement least privileg element begin paper requir provid want begin zerotrust journey long implement technolog modern ident access manag system support author least privileg martin note s matter implement tech put element place healthcar number differ applic secur leader task ensur implement tool integr central manag system monitor leverag finegrain author s someth suspici happen block out zero trust nt necessarili go work everi singl market everi singl organ s someth consid said martin even provid organ abl complet full journey secur model bolster access various applic tool paramount element zero trust particular around access manag go long way even altern process achiev martin healthcar entiti consid zerotrust journey first pilot model offic set determin whether feasibl capabl broad complex caregiv environ small pilot program determin possibl work organ whether broader program achiev end day key challeng procur iot devic may hinder process mean secur leader begin chip away issu iot devic secur boil polici provid need strengthen evalu inventori devic network ensur authent possibl user author exampl wireless telecom devic caregiv wear around neck nt abl escal privileg re abl access patient inform explain major attack stem elev privileg strong user profil polici reduc risk devic procur anoth area policybas solut martin stress entiti polici requir buy decis softwar tool meet establish secur requir ensur devic procur reput vendor support zerotrust architectur s matter buy someth look cool could work s also make sure meet secur requir back end said martin way leader inadvert open backdoor enabl somebodi someth nt do organ must talk current vendor consult determin current capabl figur chang current polici perhap tech improv current state author access challeng finegrain author possibl healthcar start polici key exampl begin user access ensur clinician workforc member access inform need perform role issu often overlook healthcar environ ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
27,,Concerns Emerge Over Proposed SEC Cyber Incident Disclosure Changes,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33803/Concerns-Emerge-Over-Proposed-SEC-Cyber-Incident-Disclosure-Changes.html,"/09/5,","Facing increased breaches on its systems and among its members, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering how it will better handle cyber threats. The SEC proposed new amendments in March to govern how investment firms and public companies under its purview should improve upon their IT security management and incident reporting. “Over the years, our disclosure regime has evolved to reflect evolving risks and investor needs,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a March release. “Today, cybersecurity is an emerging risk with which public issuers increasingly must contend. Investors want to know more about how issuers are managing those growing risks,” Gensler said. “A lot of issuers already provide cybersecurity disclosure to investors. I think companies and investors alike would benefit if this information were required in a consistent, comparable, and decision-useful manner.” In July, the SEC slammed JP Morgan Chase & Co, UBS and online stock-trader TradeStation with having deficient customer identity programs, each having violated the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule, or Regulation S-ID between January 2017 and October 2019. Regulation S-ID seeks to protect investors from the risk of identity theft. All three financial institutions agreed to cease and desist from future violations, to be censured, and to pay fines of $1.2 million, $925,000, and $425,000, respectively. Among other commitments, the SEC's proposed amendments would require that financial institutions offer current reporting about “material cybersecurity incidents and periodic reporting to provide updates about previously reported cybersecurity incidents. In March, the SEC issued that a “proposed rule defines a cybersecurity incident as an unauthorized occurrence on or conducted through a registrant’s information systems that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a registrant’s information systems or any information residing therein.” Within the new rule it viewed “information systems” very broadly, especially when the financial firm made use of a cloud- or host-based system. “The proposal also would require periodic reporting about a registrant’s policies and procedures to identify and manage cybersecurity risks. The registrant’s board of directors' oversight of cybersecurity risk,” said in the amendment, “and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing cybersecurity risk and implementing cybersecurity policies and procedures.” “The SEC proposal further would require annual reporting or certain proxy disclosure about the board of directors’ cybersecurity expertise, if any,” it said. “The proposed amendments are intended to better inform investors about a registrant's risk management, strategy, and governance and to provide timely notification to investors of material cybersecurity incidents.” In Deloitte's 2021 Future of Cyber Survey of financial industry cybersecurity, more than 72% of respondents indicated that their organizations had experienced between one and 10 cyber incidents or breaches in 2020 alone. And nearly three-quarters (74%) of so-called botnet attacks have hit the financial industry.",face increas breach system among member secur exchang commiss sec consid better handl cyber threat sec propos new amend march govern invest firm public compani purview improv upon secur manag incid report year disclosur regim evolv reflect evolv risk investor need said sec chair gari gensler march releas today cybersecur emerg risk public issuer increas must contend investor want know issuer manag grow risk gensler said lot issuer alreadi provid cybersecur disclosur investor think compani investor alik would benefit inform requir consist compar decisionus manner juli sec slam jp morgan chase co ub onlin stocktrad tradest defici custom ident program violat ident theft red flag rule regul sid januari octob regul sid seek protect investor risk ident theft three financi institut agre ceas desist futur violat censur pay fine million respect among commit sec s propos amend would requir financi institut offer current report materi cybersecur incid period report provid updat previous report cybersecur incid march sec issu propos rule defin cybersecur incid unauthor occurr conduct registr inform system jeopard confidenti integr avail registr inform system inform resid therein within new rule view inform system broad especi financi firm made use cloud hostbas system propos also would requir period report registr polici procedur identifi manag cybersecur risk registr board director oversight cybersecur risk said amend manag role expertis assess manag cybersecur risk implement cybersecur polici procedur sec propos would requir annual report certain proxi disclosur board director cybersecur expertis said propos amend intend better inform investor registr s risk manag strategi govern provid time notif investor materi cybersecur incid deloitt s futur cyber survey financi industri cybersecur respond indic organ experienc one cyber incid breach alon near threequart socal botnet attack hit financi industri ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
28,,"Credential Phishing Attack Targeted 16,000 Emails At Non-Profit Agency",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33802/Credential-Phishing-Attack-Targeted-16-000-Emails-At-Non-Profit-Agency.html,"/09/2,","Researchers have uncovered an effective recent phishing attack where the fraudster claims to be the prominent charge card brand American Express, and demands that cardholders open an attachment and contact the card company immediately regarding the cardholder’s account, according to a Thursday research post from Armorblox. “Attackers took advantage of the loyalty and trust victims have in the brand, American Express, in an attempt to steal confidential information,” according to the post, referencing the email spoofing of the well-regarded card brand. According to Armorblox, the email attack looked like a “legitimate notification email from American Express (AmEx) that included an attachment informing recipients that an account verification was mandatory; otherwise, the account would be suspended.” However, the main link, within the email attachment message, navigated to a fake American Express-branded landing page that prompted victims to sign in to verify the account, which of course puts cardholders right where scammers want them. “Credential phishing is the most prominent attack type we see against financial firms,” said DJ Sampath, co-founder and CEO of Armorblox. “This zero-day attack contained a malicious URL within the attachment, and protecting against this type of targeted attack is two-fold.” Attackers used a known domain to launch this attack, Sampath said. However, since legacy and native email security solutions predominantly stop mass phishing attacks that originate from known malicious domains, many companies do not have the capabilities to stop these sophisticated attacks, he pointed out. “Additionally, zero-day attacks require more advanced techniques such as computer vision-based website forensics,” Sampath added. So far, bypassing Google Workspace security, at least 16,000 email addresses for employees at a large international nonprofit agency have been targeted by this attack. Since American Express is popular with business users, who are often issued their charge card by their employer, this tactic plays to the cardholder’s fear that they might run afoul of their business’s rules regarding expenses and reimbursement. The scam utilizes social engineering, as well as brand impersonation, spoofed landing pages and malware, according to Armorblox, which altogether makes the ruse seem very realistic. The subject line of these fraudulent emails or texts typically read, “Important Notification About Your Account,” which Armorblox research pointed out, “creat[es] a sense of urgency within the victim that this email is important and should be opened immediately. Once opened, the email looked like a legitimate email communication from American Express, with the information within the email body including directions on how best to view the secure, encrypted message attached.” After opening the attachment, cardholders are asked to provide additional verification information for their charge card account. Bad actors create even greater urgency by saying to their victims: “This is your last chance to confirm it before we suspend it.” This often motivates cardholders, especially with bank cards issued by an employer, to walk through the authentication process. “Vendor compromise and supply chain attacks are the biggest threats to financial firms,” Sampath said. “And successful attackers can do extended damage to the organization’s reputation and financial standing.”",research uncov effect recent phish attack fraudster claim promin charg card brand american express demand cardhold open attach contact card compani immedi regard cardhold account accord thursday research post armorblox attack took advantag loyalti trust victim brand american express attempt steal confidenti inform accord post referenc email spoof wellregard card brand accord armorblox email attack look like legitim notif email american express amex includ attach inform recipi account verif mandatori otherwis account would suspend howev main link within email attach messag navig fake american expressbrand land page prompt victim sign verifi account cours put cardhold right scammer want credenti phish promin attack type see financi firm said dj sampath cofound ceo armorblox zeroday attack contain malici url within attach protect type target attack twofold attack use known domain launch attack sampath said howev sinc legaci nativ email secur solut predomin stop mass phish attack origin known malici domain mani compani capabl stop sophist attack point addit zeroday attack requir advanc techniqu comput visionbas websit forens sampath ad far bypass googl workspac secur least email address employe larg intern nonprofit agenc target attack sinc american express popular busi user often issu charg card employ tactic play cardhold fear might run afoul busi rule regard expens reimburs scam util social engin well brand imperson spoof land page malwar accord armorblox altogeth make ruse seem realist subject line fraudul email text typic read import notif account armorblox research point creat e sens urgenc within victim email import open immedi open email look like legitim email communic american express inform within email bodi includ direct best view secur encrypt messag attach open attach cardhold ask provid addit verif inform charg card account bad actor creat even greater urgenc say victim last chanc confirm suspend it often motiv cardhold especi bank card issu employ walk authent process vendor compromis suppli chain attack biggest threat financi firm sampath said success attack extend damag organ reput financi stand ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'password', 'phish']"
29,,How Will Meta Treat Personal Data After High Court's Abortion Ruling?,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33800/How-Will-Meta-Treat-Personal-Data-After-High-Courts-Abortion-Ruling.html,"/09/2,","Four Democratic members of Congress are seeking answers from Meta over a recent criminal report in Nebraska revealed Meta released consumer data, including private communications, with law enforcement over abortion allegations. In a letter to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Reps. Frank Pallone Jr., D-N.J., Anna Eshoo, D- Calif., Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., raise a host of privacy and safety concerns after claims the company shared private conversations and health data with law enforcement tied to a potential crime involving a pregnancy. The inquiry joins a growing list of others into big tech companies following the Roe v. Wade abortion ruling and several new state laws criminalizing abortion services, over privacy and safety concerns posed by hospital data scraping, location tracking, and other data-sharing. The Meta letter stems from reports that surfaced in early August about a 41-year-old Nebraska woman facing charges for allegedly helping her daughter illegally abort her pregnancy. Law enforcement was investigating the pair over claims of mishandling fetal remains and related charges. Police sent Facebook a warrant in June requesting access to private messages sent on the social media platform, which it provided. The actions drew ire across the board, appearing to confirm fears raised by privacy leaders: after the Supreme Court ruling, big tech and social media data-sharing and location tracking could put the safety and livelihood of women at risk. Facebook quickly refuted the media reports as “plain wrong.” Setting “the record straight,” a spokesperson noted that the “valid legal warrants from local law enforcement on June 7” were sent before the Dobbs v. Jackson Supreme Court decision and “did not mention abortion at all.” Regardless of the outcome of the case, the lawmakers are fearful that Facebook and other tech companies will see a growing number of similar requests from law enforcement in the future in light of the Roe v. Wade upheaval “for the purpose of criminalizing those who seek abortion services.” “The possibilities are endless and are endlessly troubling,” the lawmakers wrote. “Users rely on Facebook and your other platforms to communicate with each other about their personal lives, and therefore your company has access to highly sensitive information.”  The lawmakers are concerned that “it’s only a matter of time before Meta is asked by law enforcement to turn over personal data of users in which they specifically cite attempting or performing abortion as the crime being investigated.” It’s also foreseeable that the company is asked to turn over conversations of those assisting loved ones seeking abortion care. “Personal conversations about accessing health care services may now be considered evidence of crimes by law enforcement in certain jurisdictions,” they added. Given the sensitivity of the data, Facebook has been asked to shed light on how users’ sensitive data is protected on its site, while it complies with legal obligations. “In this environment, appropriately safeguarding personal information and communications on your platform is paramount,” the lawmakers wrote. Meta has been asked to provide a briefing to the committee by the end of the month to detail its treatment of personal data, along with its policies and procedures as it relates to sharing user data with law enforcement and other outside parties. Lawmakers also asked for insights into the possible steps the company is taking to improve data security for its users, as well as “greater clarity as to the circumstances under which Meta would release that data to a third party.”",four democrat member congress seek answer meta recent crimin report nebraska reveal meta releas consum data includ privat communic law enforc abort alleg letter meta platform ceo mark zuckerberg rep frank pallon jr dnj anna eshoo d calif diana degett dcolo jan schakowski dill rais host privaci safeti concern claim compani share privat convers health data law enforc tie potenti crime involv pregnanc inquiri join grow list other big tech compani follow roe v wade abort rule sever new state law crimin abort servic privaci safeti concern pose hospit data scrape locat track datashar meta letter stem report surfac earli august yearold nebraska woman face charg alleg help daughter illeg abort pregnanc law enforc investig pair claim mishandl fetal remain relat charg polic sent facebook warrant june request access privat messag sent social medium platform provid action drew ire across board appear confirm fear rais privaci leader suprem court rule big tech social medium datashar locat track could put safeti livelihood woman risk facebook quick refut medium report plain wrong set record straight spokesperson note valid legal warrant local law enforc june sent dobb v jackson suprem court decis mention abort all regardless outcom case lawmak fear facebook tech compani see grow number similar request law enforc futur light roe v wade upheav purpos crimin seek abort servic possibl endless endless troubl lawmak wrote user reli facebook platform communic person life therefor compani access high sensit inform lawmak concern matter time meta ask law enforc turn person data user specif cite attempt perform abort crime investig also forese compani ask turn convers assist love one seek abort care person convers access health care servic may consid evid crime law enforc certain jurisdict ad given sensit data facebook ask shed light user sensit data protect site compli legal oblig environ appropri safeguard person inform communic platform paramount lawmak wrote meta ask provid brief committe end month detail treatment person data along polici procedur relat share user data law enforc outsid parti lawmak also ask insight possibl step compani take improv data secur user well greater clariti circumst meta would releas data third parti ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss', 'facebook']"
30,,DoD Grants Fund Security Research For Maritime Industry,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33795/DoD-Grants-Fund-Security-Research-For-Maritime-Industry.html,"/09/1,","09/01/2022: This piece was updated with comment from the University of Rhode Island Research Foundation. The Department of Defense has opened up millions of dollars in grant funding to a research consortium in Rhode Island that will fund cybersecurity and supply chain research for the maritime industry. Earlier this month, the department designated six new Defense Manufacturing Communities across the country. The program, authorized through the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, is designed to fund long-term investments in local businesses that work on national security technologies or innovation. The money is awarded to joint ventures made up of academic institutions, defense contractors or associations, non-profits or state and local governments. One of the consortiums selected this year is led by the University of Rhode Island Research Foundation, which is proposing to use up to $5 million in federal grant funding “to address weaknesses in the maritime defense industrial base through strengthening workforce training or retraining or recruitment and retention, and expanding small business assistance to support automation and robotics and cyber resiliency.” “The project will provide a minimum of 50 small business assistance grants, educate and train 675 students and workers using Manufacturing Innovation Institute enhanced offerings, and launch an innovative Education to Assessment model to enhance assessment capability and supplier matching for DoD supply chain companies,” reads a project description on DoD’s website. In an email Erik Brine, director for defense research and development initiatives and operations at the university, told SC Media that one of the proposals, a pilot project between URI, Polaris MEP, MxD and ARM will enhance the capacity of programs offered by Polaris, including supply chain mapping, customer discovery, meeting DoD cybersecurity standards, and the use of automation and robotics.  ""We will do this by leveraging what any university has in abundance, human capital, and combining it with what MxD and ARM can provide, dramatic expertise,"" Brine said. ""We will leverage the expertise, programming, and curriculum of MxD and ARM to train URI students to provide these capabilities under the direction of Polaris MEP."" The funding will also give companies access to both assessments and recommendations while building out the larger program that will train students in badly needed cybersecurity and supply chain skillsets. ""Doing this will not only prepare these students with hands-on experience in the field, but it will also fill a void in capability and capacity that exists in our ecosystem,"" said Brine. According to DoD, the department has doled out $50 million in funding for the program over the last two years to 11 defense manufacturing communities, 1,350 businesses and 29,000 workers. The funding has gone to develop 11 new defense technologies, make improvements for 23 more and provide cybersecurity assistance to nearly 400 companies. In addition to the URI Research Foundation, the consortium partners include academic and research institutions like Polaris MEP, 401 Tech Bridge, Brown University and the Rhode Island Department of Education, defense contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat, Raytheon, and military institutions like the U.S. Naval Warfare College and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, among others. In a statement, Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., co-founder of the congressional cybersecurity caucus, said the grants would benefit both national security and his home state economy. “The University of Rhode Island Research Foundation’s designation as a Defense Manufacturing Community will attract millions of dollars in federal investments to advance our national security, develop our workforce, and drive Rhode Island’s economy forward,” said Langevin. “I can’t wait to see how this grant funding will help our defense manufacturing sector to expand its cutting-edge work on issues of robotics, cybersecurity and other emerging technologies.”",piec updat comment univers rhode island research foundat depart defens open million dollar grant fund research consortium rhode island fund cybersecur suppli chain research maritim industri earlier month depart design six new defens manufactur communiti across countri program author nation defens author act design fund longterm invest local busi work nation secur technolog innov money award joint ventur made academ institut defens contractor associ nonprofit state local govern one consortium select year led univers rhode island research foundat propos use million feder grant fund address weak maritim defens industri base strengthen workforc train retrain recruit retent expand small busi assist support autom robot cyber resili project provid minimum small busi assist grant educ train student worker use manufactur innov institut enhanc offer launch innov educ assess model enhanc assess capabl supplier match dod suppli chain compani read project descript dod websit email erik brine director defens research develop initi oper univers told sc medium one propos pilot project uri polari mep mxd arm enhanc capac program offer polari includ suppli chain map custom discoveri meet dod cybersecur standard use autom robot leverag univers abund human capit combin mxd arm provid dramat expertis brine said leverag expertis program curriculum mxd arm train uri student provid capabl direct polari mep fund also give compani access assess recommend build larger program train student bad need cybersecur suppli chain skillset prepar student handson experi field also fill void capabl capac exist ecosystem said brine accord dod depart dole million fund program last two year defens manufactur communiti busi worker fund gone develop new defens technolog make improv provid cybersecur assist near compani addit uri research foundat consortium partner includ academ research institut like polari mep tech bridg brown univers rhode island depart educ defens contractor general dynam electr boat raytheon militari institut like u naval warfar colleg naval undersea warfar center among other statement rep jim langevin dri cofound congression cybersecur caucus said grant would benefit nation secur home state economi univers rhode island research foundat design defens manufactur communiti attract million dollar feder invest advanc nation secur develop workforc drive rhode island economi forward said langevin wait see grant fund help defens manufactur sector expand cuttingedg work issu robot cybersecur emerg technolog ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'military']"
31,,Have 3rd Party Hacking Groups Lost Interest In The Russia Ukraine Conflict,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33783/Have-3rd-Party-Hacking-Groups-Lost-Interest-In-The-Russia-Ukraine-Conflict.html,30/08/2022,"Theories that the war between Russia and Ukraine is rewriting modern warfare with the involvement of third-party cybercriminal groups and hacktivists may be overblown, a new research paper claims. In a study released this month, six academic researchers from the universities of Cambridge, Strathclyde and Edinburgh argue that while the onset of the war saw notable involvement from groups like the IT Army of Ukraine and others defacing websites or conducting denial-of-service attacks against Russian websites, as well as threats from ransomware groups and other cybercriminals groups on behalf of Russia, that activity has tailed off significantly in the months after the start of the invasion as many participants got “bored” and moved on. “Our findings indicate that the conflict briefly but significantly caught the attention of the low-level cybercrime community, with notable shifts in the geographical distribution of both defacement and DDoS attacks. However, the role of these players in so-called cyberwarfare is minor, and they do not resemble the ‘hacktivists’ imagined in popular criminological accounts,” wrote authors Anh V. Vu, Daniel R. Thomas, Ben Collier, Alice Hutchings, Richard Clayton and Ross Anderson. To reach their conclusions, the researchers collected evidence of more than 281,000 web defacement attacks and 1.7 million reflected denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks executed in the two months before the invasion and the four months following, as well as announcements posted on volunteer hacker forums and interviews with unaffiliated pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine hackers who took part in the attacks. The beginning of the war did kick off intense interest from groups like the IT Army, Anonymous and other volunteer partisan hackers who swore to extend the conflict to the digital arena by shutting down Russian or Ukrainian businesses, governments and critical infrastructure. Further, ransomware hacking groups like Conti made public pronouncements in support of the Russian government while threatening to attack critical infrastructure in Western countries who were opposed to invasion and funneling arms to Ukraine. The reliance on civilian hackers in a hot war has caused some consternation among U.S. officials, with both NSA Cybersecurity Director Rob Joyce and National Cyber Director Chris Inglis saying in recent months that the U.S. does not endorse vigilante hacktivism, with Joyce saying he worried it could undercut international efforts to pressure countries like Russia to be more accountable for the actions of ransomware groups and other cybercriminals operating within their own borders. “I think all of us wanted to root for those folks. It was a little bit of a challenge that they were out there launching attacks on another country in an era where we’re trying to hold the Russians accountable for the attacks emanating out of their space, right?” said Joyce at the RSA Conference in San Francisco in June. However, the researchers argue that alarmist predictions of civilian-directed cyberwar “have not come to pass” and much of the activity they did track amounted to small nuisance attacks against unaffiliated websites and organizations. “Our analysis challenges ‘cyberwar’ narratives of a cybercrime underground producing organised, motivated, and technically skilled hacktivists. Instead, we find that most budding cyberwarriors used trivial attacks to take down meaningless minor targets and largely got bored after a couple of weeks,” the authors write. It should be noted that not everybody agrees with the view put forward by the researchers that non-governmental hackers have gone quiet. Intel 471, a threat intelligence company that tracks the infrastructure, communications and activities of cybercriminal groups, has not observed a drop off in interest around the Ukraine-Russia war from non-governmental hackers, with Michael DeBolt, chief intelligence officer, telling SC Media “we are not seeing signs of this interest waning” in recent months. “We are not seeing a meaningful decline in interest by activists who have aligned themselves to pro-Russian or pro-Ukrainian causes,” said DeBolt. “Since the start of the war, some threat actors operating in the cybercrime underground have pivoted their motivation from purely financial gain to geo-political ends leveraging their tools, infrastructure, and capabilities to advance the cause of whatever side they have chosen.” He did acknowledge that tracking this kind of activity and its impact can be difficult as it relies, in part, on corroboration from unreliable parties, and that on the whole the cybercrime underground has largely remained unaffected by the conflict and dominated by financially motivated actors who couldn’t care less about geopolitical or ideological goals. The war has also seen unprecedented involvement from legitimate businesses in the West and other regions, though this assistance has largely been defensive in nature. Still, some have backed up the notion that offensive campaigns carried out by volunteer groups or legitimate businesses and individuals have attempted to impose costs on Russian society without the visibility or ground-level intelligence that nation-states and militaries use to pick strategic and relevant targets. Oliver Tavakoli, chief technology officer for Vectra AI, which has offered free cybersecurity tooling and monitoring for organizations who may have their digital assets targeted in the fallout of the war, said the explosion of third-party hacks in the wake of the invasion has led to a diffusion of central control has led to “a weird situation where you’re worried about inbound vectors, [but] you’re also worried to a certain degree about becoming an outbound vector and becoming a legitimate target as part of that.” “What we’ve started seeing, interestingly enough, is within our customer base — which is not in Ukraine — seeing sympathetic parties, employees using the infrastructure of our customers’ environment to start to try to attack what they view to be Russian targets, and without a really high-quality targeting capabilities and a clear understanding of what they’re doing,” Tavakoli told SC Media earlier this month. “So for example, you’d see a Russian website being hosted in a German web hosting company being attacked by servers within a customer network.”",theori war russia ukrain rewrit modern warfar involv thirdparti cybercrimin group hacktivist may overblown

32,,Why The Pentagon Remains Both The Best And Worst Customer For Tech Innovators,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33757/Why-The-Pentagon-Remains-Both-The-Best-And-Worst-Customer-For-Tech-Innovators.html,22/08/2022,"The Pentagon does not lack for offices and programs that are designed to foster innovative technology and engage with cutting edge ideas, whether internally or in the private sector. And yet, the struggle to penetrate the Department of Defense with big ideas remains real. Consider a report issued last year by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, which found that despite the myriad of offices defense officials stood up over the years around innovation, efforts have largely been disconnected from DoD’s procurement operations, limiting scope and impact. In particular, the report concluded that the military’s engagement with smaller companies and nontraditional tech vendors rarely amounted to more than “innovation tourism.” Said authors Melissa Flagg and Jack Corrigan: “We find the military’s current approach to engaging with small tech companies, or nontraditional vendors, is more akin to innovation tourism — with the DoD sampling the local fare of the United States’ various tech hubs — than a bona fide strategy for bringing emerging technologies into the department."" So what might move the needle of innovation, most notably in the area of cybersecurity? SC Media examined the good and bad of selling to the the world's biggest buyer. Of course, it's difficult to speak about innovation in DoD without referencing the work of the Defense Advanced Research Protection Agency. DARPA brings a 50-year history of developing novel technological solutions to government problems. But newer agencies like the Defense Innovation Unit were explicitly set up to tap into Silicon Valley’s ecosystem of tech startups. Katherine Gronberg, head government services at NightDragon, a venture capital firm that invests in late-stage cybersecurity companies, said there is “a lot of nuance” to how the military approaches its innovation problem. Between entities like DARPA, DIU, In-Q-Tel and others, it’s clear that Pentagon leaders are on some level attuned to their innovation problem. At the same time, she said it’s not clear that these programs have been able to make a broader impact on existing obstacles across the military when it comes to adopting cutting-edge tech. “There has not been a comprehensive look at how we do rapid acquisition, speeding the way to adopt innovation,” Gronberg said in an interview. Congress has also been left to wonder at times why military leaders keep requesting new programs designed to bridge the innovation gap in procurement while previously funded efforts have been underutilized. In a report on the 2023 defense authorization process, the Senate Appropriations Committee questioned why a new, $100 million fund was needed to enhance the department’s access to commercial technologies in light of existing programs and continued reports from the private sector about difficulties engaging with the DoD bureaucracy. It also encouraged the undersecretary of defense for research and engineering to coordinate more closely with offices like DIU to ensure those efforts are synchronized across the department. “The Committee notes that the Department has existing outreach efforts designed to improve connectivity with the private sector and academia; however, the Committee continues to receive feedback from non-traditional and small businesses that barriers to entry remain high, and that the process for transitioning promising innovative commercial technologies to a program of record within the Department remains arduous and cumbersome,” the committee wrote this year. If repeating the same stale acquisition strategy over and over again while expecting new results is the definition of insanity, newer entities stood up within DoD have looked for ways to bypass the crazy. The DIU, which began as an experimental project in 2015 before being established as a permanent office, is meant to be one of the military’s most direct answers to this problem. Based in Silicon Valley, DIU is specifically set up to bypass many of the bureaucratic and acquisition roadblocks that have plagued other parts of the department. From the very beginning, DIU’s acquisition process is set up to be distinct from standard government or military buying protocols. Their solicitations are crafted more like problem statements that need solving, rather than the prescribed set of requirement and solutions that wind up in most federal bids. They typically stay open for two weeks, and companies that express interest are asked to submit a proposal that is no longer than five pages or 20 PowerPoint slides. Cherissa Tamayori, director of acquisition and senior contracting official at DIU, said it is in part a conscious effort to avoid alienating smaller or nontraditional companies who may be unfamiliar, intimidated or put off by the massive paperwork requirements that often come with federal contracting. “We’re really targeting the commercial market and the innovative ideas that come from that market space, so instead of telling you what we want and how we want you to do it, we basically propose a question and provide a lot of [space] for industry to come back to us with their best ideas,” said Tamayori in an interview. “Because of that, we really see a large response to a lot of our [procurements], where our process is highly competitive and that’s the intent. We really want to reach as many companies as we can because that basically opens up the opportunity for us to see that many more solutions.” After consulting with partner agencies, DIU then invites a select number of companies to come give an in-person or virtual “Shark Tank” pitch, with companies asked to provide a model or live demonstration of their technologies. In the final phase, a team of representatives from the government and the final selected companies will collaborate together on a statement of work for the project. This approach does bring an admirable number of new companies into the fold. According to figures provided by the agency, between June 2016 and September 2021, 33% of their contract awardees have been first-time DoD vendors; 86% are considered nontraditional and 73% are small businesses. “You’d be surprised how many of the companies that we’ve never heard about who respond to solicitations actually get the award on the back end,” said Patrick Gould, deputy director of the DIU’s cyber portfolio. The DIU has pushed out a slate of cybersecurity-related projects over the last year, and the cyber portfolio “specifically has gotten lucky” by tapping first time federal sellers. Gould told SC Media in an interview that U.S. Cyber Command and NSA “have essentially been the main and the lead customer” of projects under his purview. Because of that, many are designed to align with the broader strategic objectives laid out by Gen. Paul Nakasone, who leads both agencies. But other agencies have been able to tap the approximately 200-person strong organization for new security capabilities as well, including a $633,000 prototype software for asset inventory management developed by IntelliPeak Solutions for the Defense Information Systems Agency, and a $679,000 prototype platform developed by CounterCraft for the Air Force that creates sophisticated deception environments to detect malicious cyber activity and has already been tested in military wargames with national and NATO-level red teams. “We try to make it as commercially friendly as possible, so we try to mirror what those vendors are seeing specifically in the security realm, like if any other CISO was coming to them and saying hey I want to use your capability,’” said Gould. DIU is able to do this largely because of a once-obscure federal contracting process known as the other transaction authority. Originally designed engage with smaller, nontraditional companies on research and development projects, OTAs allow government agencies to establish contracts and other agreements with the private sector and universities that are not subject to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, or DFAR, which serve as the primary rules that dictate how contractors can be leveraged by DoD. All DIU prototype contracts are awarded under this authority, and Tamayori said this not only allows for more freedom to set terms with the vendor during the procurement phase but also over the life of the contract. Because of this, small startups and non-contractors don’t have to completely overhaul their internal structure or mission in order to do business with DoD the way they would when pursuing traditional contracts. “What this allows us to do is really be more flexible both throughout our process and while negotiating the final agreement. We are able to negotiate terms and conditions as well as data rates that could be more flexible than would otherwise be allowed if you were just issuing a solicitation"" subject to FAR, she said. While offices like DIU have been able to see success with this more nimble and nontraditional approach, it still represents a small pocket of the approximately $130 billion the military on research, development, testing and evaluation, the pot of money that encompasses much of the new software and innovation that DoD buys and develops. Indeed, while the work being done at places like DIU has found ways to break through the morass that is the status quo in defense procurement, these serve as anomalies. In order to fix DoD’s broader innovation problem, outside observers say those same processes must begin to permeate throughout the other branches and at the highest levels of leadership. Last year Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., chair of the House Armed Services Committee, compared the marginalized role DIU currently plays in the larger defense technology ecosystem to the way Special Operations Command was ignored by Pentagon leadership in the years prior to the 9/11 attacks. SOCOM is now a central piece of the military’s global counterterrorism strategy, and Smith said a similar recognition could empower its technology procurement and innovation offices. “We’ve got to start moving to get to the point where DIU and other organizations are as big as SOCOM,  in terms of really driving how the Pentagon does business,” Smith said in comments captured by Defense Daily.  But the procurement morass continues to get in the way. Time and again, critics both internal and external have questioned the Pentagon’s ability to purchase and implement innovative technologies fast enough to keep pace with industry standards and international competitors. Last year Nicolas Chaillan, the first chief software officer for the U.S. Air Force, publicly resigned from his position, describing it as “probably the most challenging and infuriating [job] of my entire career.” He called out the DoD for failing to empower its IT and cybersecurity leaders, falling behind China and other world powers on technologies like artificial intelligence and paying lip service when it comes to tapping the private sector for innovation. More recently Michael Brown, director of the Defense Innovation Unit, announced he will resign in September. In an interview with Breaking Defense, he cited similar concerns that his office and its mission has not received backing from key Pentagon leaders.“I just don’t feel that we’re making the kind of progress that I’d like to see made. So I’m frustrated that we’re not achieving more, we’re not supported more. There’s not the agreement by leadership that this is a priority,” Brown said. “And so if that is the case, then you can’t accomplish what you believe should be accomplished. It’s really that simple.” If DoD is going to successfully buy better technology and security tools, it will need to find similar ways to incorporate the approach offered by agencies like DIU. Gronberg said her company invests in later-stage security companies that are more mature than the average startup or small businesses, but even these companies are not set up to sell primarily to the government, and they can’t sustain or grow their business by dedicating the bulk of their resources and operations to contracting. To use them more effectively, she said the Pentagon must evolve to find quicker entry paths into doing business with DOD that don’t bog down ability of these businesses to sell to the commercial market. Otherwise many won’t be around for a second contract. “It kind of comes back to this problem: can companies grow up and cross that valley of death? Can they grow big enough that they can scale, where they can actually deploy in more than just a pilot way at the DoD? The way you do that is to make sure that there is promise and prospecting and market and pipeline on the commercial side,"" Gronberg said. ""They go hand in hand.”",pentagon lack offic program design foster innov technolog engag cut edg idea whether intern privat sector yet struggl penetr depart defens big idea remain real consid report

33,,Lawmakers Accuse DHS Watchdog Of Obstruction In Probe Of Secret Service Texts,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33739/Lawmakers-Accuse-DHS-Watchdog-Of-Obstruction-In-Probe-Of-Secret-Service-Texts.html,17/08/2022,"Two House committee chairs are accusing Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joe Cuffari of stonewalling Congress and potentially violating the law by not turning over documents and communications around the deletion of Secret Service texts in the days following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. In an Aug. 16 letter addressed to Cuffari, House Oversight and Governmental Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., and House Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said they’ve reached out three times in an effort to obtain further documentation and interviews with staff relating to DHS IG’s investigation of missing or deleted Secret Service texts and another detailing allegations of domestic abuse and sexual harassment by employees of USSS, Customs and Border Protection and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. In both cases, the committee leaders said they are investigating allegations that Cuffari sought to censor those reports while blocking relevant staffers from speaking with Congress. They characterized Cuffari’s refusals as a violation of the Inspector General Act which requires IGs to immediately notify the head of an agency when they become “aware of particularly serious or flagrant problems, abuses, or deficiencies,” who in turn must notify Congress within seven days. They threatened unspecified consequences if their demands aren't met. “Your obstruction of the Committees’ investigations is unacceptable, and your justifications for this noncompliance appear to reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of Congress’s authority and your duties as an Inspector General,” Maloney and Thompson wrote. “If you continue to refuse to comply with our requests, we will have no choice but to consider alternate measures to ensure your compliance.” Days after thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, brawled with police and attempted to disrupt the certification of incoming President Joe Biden, at least four congressional committees wrote to the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to instruct them to preserve records related to the riot. Less than two weeks later on Jan. 27, the Secret Service executed a phone and data migration plan that would wipe all data on existing phones and put the onus for backing up and preserving those records on individual employees. In July 2022, Cuffari notified Congress that certain text messages from Secret Service personnel over that period of time had been erased. Subsequent reporting by the Washington Post and the Project on Government Oversight revealed that Cuffari’s office knew about the deleted texts for more than a year but had failed to notify Congress. The committees also obtained a July 2021 email from DHS Deputy Inspector General Thomas Kait indicating that they were no longer interested in pursuing the records, telling a DHS representative that they are “no longer request[ing] phone records and text messages from USSS relating to the events on January 6.” Thompson and Maloney said these and other public reports strongly indicate a potential cover up on the part of DHS and the IG, and are seeking additional records that include “drafts, working papers, or communications” regarding the reports and any attempts by DHS IG to censor or remove relevant portions. In an Aug. 8 letter from DHS IG released by the committee, Cuffari claims to have to reported “various access issues” with DHS component agencies through a 2021 semiannual report to Congress. That report claims unnamed DHS agencies “significantly delayed OIG’s access to Department records, thereby impeding the progress of OIG’s review of the January 6 events at the Capitol” but does not mention the Secret Service or the erasure of text messages. Earlier this month, the Project on Government Oversight released a draft of an April 1 alert developed by DHS IG to inform Congress about the missing texts. It specifically names requirements in the Inspector General Act to report obstruction and reveals that Secret Service agents were unresponsive to some records requests related to the deleted texts, cited protocols not backed up in U.S. law for the delays and declined to identify reviewers processing the records requests. The alert, drafted on April 1, 2022, was never sent. In his Aug. 8 letter, Cuffari declined to comply with the additional document and interview requests, citing an unspecified, ongoing criminal investigation. “To protect the integrity of our work and preserve our independence, we do not share information about ongoing matters, like the information you requested in your letters,” Cuffari wrote. “Similarly, we do not authorize our staff to sit for transcribed interviews with your committee about these ongoing matters.” But Thompson and Maloney say U.S. law clearly gives Congress the right to conduct its own independent investigation and seek records, and testimony from witnesses. An earlier notification to Congress would have “provided Congress with a detailed explanation of Secret Service’s resistance to OIG’s oversight activities” and revealed the existence of the missing texts months earlier. They flatly rejected Cuffari’s explanation that his office could not comply with congressional records requests during an ongoing criminal investigation, citing Supreme Court precedent and prior parallel congressional investigations in 2015 around the alleged targeting of conservative groups by the IRS and in 2017 examining alleged collusion and coordination between the Trump campaign and a Russian election influence operation during the 2016 presidential elections. Additionally, they noted that the records and interviews are relevant and necessary because Congress is directly investigating potential misconduct by Cuffari and his office in conducting his duties. “The Committees are seeking to determine whether you censored findings of domestic abuse and sexual harassment by DHS employees, covered up the extent of missing records in your investigation of the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and failed to fulfill the requirements for Inspectors General to perform their work with independence and objectivity,” Thompson and Maloney wrote. “Full compliance with our requests is necessary, in part to determine whether legislative reforms are needed to ensure the duties of Inspectors General are carried out in an ‘independent and objective’ manner and that Congress is kept ‘fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies’ as required by law.”",two hous committe chair accus depart homeland secur inspector general joe cuffari stonewal

34,,FTC Kicks Off Potentially Massive New Regulation On Commercial Surveillance,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33729/FTC-Kicks-Off-Potentially-Massive-New-Regulation-On-Commercial-Surveillance.html,12/08/2022,"The Federal Trade Commission narrowly voted to explore new regulations on commercial data surveillance, saying the growing practice raises the risk of data breaches, manipulation of consumers and other harmful practices. In a 3-2 vote, the commission voted in favor of beginning a process that could result in some of the most stringent consumer privacy and data security protections ever. The agency filed an advance notice of proposed rulemaking this week laying out the rationale for new regulations, writing that modern consumers must essentially forfeit their privacy and personal data as the cost of entry into our modern technological society. Devices, applications, browsers and software programs now regularly and routinely collect data points that reveal their habits, hobbies, friendship circles, place of employment, religion and even things like pregnancy status and menstrual cycles. Meanwhile, industry at large has moved over the years to hoover up and sell as much of that data as possible to ad brokers, marketing shops and other providers. These are often preceded that expansive terms of service agreements that virtually no one reads but are required to access most major products and services that connect to the internet. “An elaborate and lucrative market for the collection, retention, aggregation, analysis, and onward disclosure of consumer data incentivizes many of the services and products on which people have come to rely. Businesses reportedly use this information to target services — namely, to set prices, curate newsfeeds, serve advertisements, and conduct research on people’s behavior, among other things,” the FTC said in the notice. “While, in theory, these personalization practices have the potential to benefit consumers, reports note that they have facilitated consumer harms that can be difficult if not impossible for any one person to avoid.” This data collection also means that when these companies are eventually breached, they are able to provide malicious hackers with massive treasure troves of data that can be sold on underground markets, used to craft advanced spearphishing techniques and facilitate fraud and other deceptive operations. Thus far the FTC’s enforcement of privacy and data security in this sector has been done on a case-by-case basis, but that experience “suggests that enforcement alone without rulemaking may be insufficient to protect consumers from significant harms.” Current rules limit the agency’s ability to punish or fine first-time offenders, nor does it undo the damage to consumer data if there is a breach. The agency also lacks the resources to conduct individual investigations and enforcement action against every violator and believes a proactive regulation would be more effective curbing these practices more broadly. In a statement, Chair Lina Khan said putting new rules in place was necessary to place meaningful limits on data collectors and give Americans a measure of control over their personal information. “The data practices of today’s surveillance economy can create and exacerbate deep asymmetries of information — exacerbating, in turn, imbalances of power. And the expanding contexts in which users’ personal data is used — from health care and housing to employment and education — mean that what’s at stake with unlawful collection, use, retention, or disclosure is not just one’s subjective preference for privacy, but one’s access to opportunities in our economy and society, as well as core civil liberties and civil rights,” Khan said. Underscoring the vast reach that these practices have on consumers, the notice includes an eye-popping 95 separate questions around how the FTC should go about regulating the sector, what kind of restrictions it should be considering to enhance data security and privacy, and what collateral effects they may have on the technology and industry landscape. Both of the commissioners who voted against the measure (Christine Wilson and Noah Joshua Phillips) were appointed by Republican President Donald Trump. In statements, both Phillips and Wilson said their vote was based, in part, on the belief that such rules should be implemented through legislation. The question is more than theoretical, as both the House and Senate have put forth their own versions of national privacy legislation that would address many of the underlying issues the FTC is considering. “National consumer privacy laws pose consequential questions, which is why I have said, repeatedly, that Congress — not the Federal Trade Commission … is where national privacy law should be enacted,” Phillips said. “I am heartened to see Congress considering just such a law today, and hope this commission process does nothing to upset that consideration.” The commission will also host a virtual public forum on commercial surveillance and data security on Sept. 8.",feder trade commiss narrowli vote explor new regul commerci data surveil say grow practic rais risk data breach manipul consum harm practic vote commiss vote favor begin process could result stringent consum privaci data secur protect ever agenc file advanc notic propos rulemak week lay rational new regul write modern consum must essenti forfeit privaci person data cost entri modern technolog societi devic applic browser softwar program regular routin collect data point reveal habit hobbi friendship circl place employ religion even thing like pregnanc status menstrual cycl meanwhil industri larg move year hoover sell much data possibl ad broker market shop provid often preced expans term servic agreement virtual one read requir access major product servic connect internet elabor lucrat market collect retent aggreg analysi onward disclosur consum data incentiv mani servic product peopl come reli busi report use inform target servic — name set price curat newsfe serv advertis conduct research peopl behavior among thing ftc said notic theori person practic potenti benefit consum report note facilit consum harm difficult imposs one person avoid data collect also mean compani eventu breach abl provid malici hacker massiv treasur trove data sold underground market use craft advanc spearphish techniqu facilit fraud decept oper thus far ftc enforc privaci data secur sector done casebycas basi experi suggest enforc alon without rulemak may insuffici protect consum signific harm current rule limit agenc abil punish fine firsttim offend undo damag consum data breach agenc also lack resourc conduct individu investig enforc action everi violat belief proactiv regul would effect curb practic broad statement chair lina khan said put new rule place necessari place meaning limit data collector give american measur control person inform data practic today surveil economi creat exacerb deep asymmetri inform — exacerb turn imbal power expand context user person data use — health care hous employ educ — mean stake unlaw collect use retent disclosur one subject prefer privaci one access opportun economi societi well core civil liberti civil right khan said underscor vast reach practic consum notic includ eyepop separ question around ftc go regul sector kind restrict consid enhanc data secur privaci collater effect may technolog industri landscap commission vote measur christin wilson noah joshua phillip appoint republican presid donald trump statement phillip wilson said vote base part belief rule implement legisl question theoret hous senat put forth version nation privaci legisl would address mani under issu ftc consid nation consum privaci law pose consequenti question said repeat congress — feder trade commiss … nation privaci law enact phillip said hearten see congress consid law today hope commiss process noth upset consider commiss also host virtual public forum commerci surveil data secur sept ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'spyware']"
35,,Stats Say Chinese Researchers Not Deterred By China's Vulnerability Law,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33720/Stats-Say-Chinese-Researchers-Not-Deterred-By-Chinas-Vulnerability-Law.html,11/08/2022,"Chinese researchers are significant contributors to vulnerability disclosure programs, both in volume and quality. When permitted by China’s government to compete in the vulnerability discovery competition Pwn2Own, for example, Chinese researchers dominated. But a recent change in Chinese laws put new burdens on researchers that could have disincentivized participation. A group from the Atlantic Council’s Cyber Statecraft Initiative sifted through the thanks-for-telling-us notes included with patches for five large vendors and found that, tentatively, there was no effect.  In July 2021, China implemented the Regulations on the Management of Network Product Security Vulnerabilities law, which included a provision saying all “network security” vulnerabilities needed to be reported to vendors and, within two days of that, the government’s own Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). The law has already felled one of the country’s largest companies: Alibaba. The government suspended an information-sharing agreement with its cloud subsidiary after it failed to alert the MIIT about a Log4j vulnerability it disclosed in Apache. “There’s some ambiguity about who the law covers, in certain cases, it refers to companies and vendors. In other cases, [it] refers to individuals, but it’s not consistent,” Stewart Scott, the lead researcher on the report, told SC Media before his unveiling the research at Black Hat.  But, with an asterix, the ambiguity and legal minefield do not appear to have caused a chilling effect on Chinese participation in disclosure. Scott and team went through the patch reports for F5, VMware, Apple, Microsoft and Red Hat, and tallied the company names associated with the researchers who discovered bugs. What they found was very little change. F5 and VMware had no Chinese companies before or after the law was announced, published or implemented. Apple and Red Hat generally trended to more Chinese disclosures. Microsoft, curiously, had a steep decline in July 2020, the month the law was announced: 59 vulnerabilities one month, 11 the next.  Scott said that may or may not be attributed to the Chinese law, noting that there were other changes going on at the time in China and, importantly, that there was no way to tell when a vulnerability was reported to Microsoft. Researcher-enforced deadlines are often 30 days to 90 days after reporting — all of which would be squarely before the July.  That difficulty in determining exactly when a vulnerability was submitted may be effecting the data overall.  “It might even be too early to tell if there is a significant supply shock from the law, let alone like what that might turn into,” Scott said.  The attributions in the patch reports are only intended to be a public thank you, and were not designed to be easily digestible as a data source. They are not standardized in any way (“There were many different spellings of the same four- to five-letter companies,” said Scott). In the future, the researchers said, there may be a lot of value in treating these like a formal data source.  “Bug reporting isn't ephemeral, anymore. It’s not enough of say there was a problem, we fixed it. The length of patch windows to get users to adopt patches, the time and quality it takes to build a patch — these are all really significant sources of information about how a vendor behaves, how significant a vulnerability is, how secure is that software product,” said Trey Herr,  director of the Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative, who worked on and presented the research with Scott. ",chines research signific contributor vulner disclosur program volum qualiti permit china govern compet vulner discoveri competit pwnown exampl chines research domin recent chang chines law put new burden research could disincentiv particip group atlant council cyber statecraft initi sift thanksfortellingus note includ patch five larg vendor found tentat effect juli china implement regul manag network product secur vulner law includ provis say network secur vulner need report vendor within two day govern ministri industri inform technolog miit law alreadi fell one countri largest compani alibaba govern suspend informationshar agreement cloud subsidiari fail alert miit logj vulner disclos apach ambigu law cover certain case refer compani vendor case refer individu consist stewart scott lead research report told sc medium unveil research black hat asterix ambigu legal minefield appear caus chill effect chines particip disclosur scott team went patch report f vmware appl microsoft red hat talli compani name associ research discov bug found littl chang f vmware chines compani law announc publish implement appl red hat general trend chines disclosur microsoft curious steep declin juli month law announc vulner one month next scott said may may attribut chines law note chang go time china import way tell vulner report microsoft researcherenforc deadlin often day day report — would squar juli difficulti determin exact vulner submit may effect data overal might even earli tell signific suppli shock law let alon like might turn scott said attribut patch report intend public thank design easili digest data sourc standard way mani differ spell four fivelett compani said scott futur research said may lot valu treat like formal data sourc bug report nt ephemer anymor enough say problem fix length patch window get user adopt patch time qualiti take build patch — realli signific sourc inform vendor behav signific vulner secur softwar product said trey herr director atlant council s cyber statecraft initi work present research scott ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'china', 'conference']"
36,,Senator Wants To Set Aside Millions For Small Biz Cybersecurity Training,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33703/Senator-Wants-To-Set-Aside-Millions-For-Small-Biz-Cybersecurity-Training.html,"/08/5,","A new Senate bill would send millions of dollars in grant funding to small business centers to train cybersecurity workers and conduct testing and review of business IT environments. The Small Business Cybersecurity Act, introduced this week by Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., would authorize $20 million in 2023 and every year thereafter to the Small Business Administration, which would in turn use it to award noncompetitive grants to small business development centers across the country in order to fund a range of cybersecurity programs and resources to small businesses, according to a copy of the bill obtained by SC Media. Those services could include things like cybersecurity trainings for workers, tabletop exercises, reviews of policies, plans or procedures, penetration testing services, or cybersecurity consultant services. In a statement, Hassan said the bill drew inspiration in part from the programs offered by the New Hampshire Small Business Development Center, which offers free cybersecurity reviews to businesses with 500 or fewer employees, web-based trainings based on National Institute for Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework and one-on-one consulting with business advisers around cybersecurity risks.   “I encourage my colleagues to pass this bill so that Small Business Development Centers in New Hampshire and across the country can keep working to protect small businesses from cyberattacks and help them thrive,” Hassan said. Small businesses are among the most vulnerable targets to malicious hackers, ransomware groups and other cybercriminal groups. A survey from Intuit of more than 2,000 small- and medium-sized businesses published in April found that 42% of reported their organization has already experienced a cybersecurity breach, while 1 in 5 listed cyberattacks as the biggest threat to their business. They make up critical parts of the technology supply chain but often lack the financial resources and expertise to dedicate to cybersecurity, two areas the bill is seeking to address. That reality can often throw a wrench into larger efforts by the federal government to raise the baseline level of cybersecurity across the nation, because many such programs require significant investments in human and technical capital. Hassan’s bill would cap the amount of grant funding that each individual state could draw from depending on their size as determined by the SBA administrator. Smaller states would receive a maximum of $200,000, medium states can receive up to $300,000 and funding to large states would be capped at $400,000.",new senat bill would send million dollar grant fund small busi center train cybersecur worker conduct test review busi environ small busi cybersecur act introduc week sen maggi hassan dnh would author million everi year thereaft small busi administr would turn use award noncompetit grant small busi develop center across countri order fund rang cybersecur program resourc small busi accord copi bill obtain sc medium servic could includ thing like cybersecur train worker tabletop exercis review polici plan procedur penetr test servic cybersecur consult servic statement hassan said bill drew inspir part program offer new hampshir small busi develop center offer free cybersecur review busi fewer employe webbas train base nation institut standard technolog cybersecur framework oneonon consult busi advis around cybersecur risk encourag colleagu pas bill small busi develop center new hampshir across countri keep work protect small busi cyberattack help thrive hassan said small busi among vulner target malici hacker ransomwar group cybercrimin group survey intuit small mediums busi publish april found report organ alreadi experienc cybersecur breach list cyberattack biggest threat busi make critic part technolog suppli chain often lack financi resourc expertis dedic cybersecur two area bill seek address realiti often throw wrench larger effort feder govern rais baselin level cybersecur across nation mani program requir signific invest human technic capit hassan bill would cap amount grant fund individu state could draw depend size determin sba administr smaller state would receiv maximum medium state receiv fund larg state would cap ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa']"
37,,Ransomware Task Force Releases SMB Blueprint For Defense And Mitigation,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33695/Ransomware-Task-Force-Releases-SMB-Blueprint-For-Defense-And-Mitigation.html,"/08/4,","The Institute for Security and Technology's Ransomware Task Force (RTF) released a blueprint for small and mid-sized enterprises to face ransomware Thursday, aiming to promote hygiene in less mature network environments. The RTF became a key resource in 2021 as governments started to take ransomware seriously as a homeland security problem. Its inaugural report, coincidentally released in April amid the chaos of Colonial Pipeline, offered recommendations for ransomware on geopolitical, federal, law enforcement, insurance and enterprise levels, and became a key document in crafting legislation. RTF sported an attractive multistakeholder membership ranging from security companies and insurers to highly targeted groups to governments and law enforcement at a time lawmakers were trying to understand the needs of the many players in the field. Many of their suggestions became policy, but the report was intended to provide solutions that did not require policy changes as well. One of those was creating a roadmap for SMBs to prevent, detect and recover from ransomware. ""The sense that we've heard from the community is that [existing frameworks] can be seen as a mismatch between the needs of small enterprises and the entities that serve them like MSPs and MSSPs,"" said Megan Stifel, chief strategy officer for the Institute for Security and Technology and a co-chair of the RTF. The blueprint includes recommendations for identity and asset management, testing and architecture, maintaining logs, and developing internal reporting practices and other recovery plans in advance. ""Rather than adding to the noise, what we wanted to do was to reiterate the importance of specific controls that through analysis have been shown to be effective in combating over 70% of ransomware attack methods,"" Stifel added. The structure of the blueprint borrows from the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls. CIS participated in contributing to the blueprint, alongside Stifel, the Global Cyber Alliance, Security Scorecard, Resilence insurance and ActZero. The ransomware space has moved quickly since the original RTF report was released. Stifel is cognizant of recent attacks resembling ransomware but using extortion without encrypting files, a la Lapsus$, and the blueprint is not tied to recovering from encrypted files.  There has been considerable movement in international commitments to fight ransomware as well as several domestic policies put into place. Stifel said that the RTF continues to view ransomware as a problem that can only be solved holistically, requiring action by each of enterprise, insurance, cryptocurrency market, and local and international government to solve. ""We didn't think that any one of these recommendations was a single bullet, rather it's ten 10% solutions,"" she said.",institut secur technolog s ransomwar task forc rtf releas blueprint small midsiz enterpris face ransomwar thursday aim promot hygien le matur network environ rtf becam key resourc govern start take ransomwar serious homeland secur problem inaugur report coincident releas april amid chao coloni pipelin offer recommend ransomwar geopolit feder law enforc insur enterpris level becam key document craft legisl rtf sport attract multistakehold membership rang secur compani insur high target group govern law enforc time lawmak tri understand need mani player field mani suggest becam polici report intend provid solut requir polici chang well one creat roadmap smbs prevent detect recov ransomwar sens ve heard communiti exist framework seen mismatch need small enterpris entiti serv like msps mssps said megan stifel chief strategi offic institut secur technolog cochair rtf blueprint includ recommend ident asset manag test architectur maintain log develop intern report practic recoveri plan advanc rather ad nois want reiter import specif control analysi shown effect combat ransomwar attack method stifel ad structur blueprint borrow center internet secur ci critic secur control ci particip contribut blueprint alongsid stifel global cyber allianc secur scorecard resil insur actzero ransomwar space move quick sinc origin rtf report releas stifel cogniz recent attack resembl ransomwar use extort without encrypt file la lapsus blueprint tie recov encrypt file consider movement intern commit fight ransomwar well sever domest polici put place stifel said rtf continu view ransomwar problem solv holist requir action enterpris insur cryptocurr market local intern govern solv nt think one recommend singl bullet rather s ten solut said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'cryptography']"
38,,Lawsuit Claims Facebook Scraping Data From Hospital Sites,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33690/Lawsuit-Claims-Facebook-Scraping-Data-From-Hospital-Sites.html,"/08/2,","A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern California last week accuses Meta, the University of California San Francisco Medical Center, and Dignity Health Medical Foundation, of allowing Facebook to scrape healthcare data from hospital websites with Meta’s Pixel tool without user consent. It’s the second proposed class-action against Meta alleging the social media giant is engaging in less-than-upstanding data privacy practices. Both follow a STAT News report detailing the alleged improper use of Meta’s Pixel tool on hospital websites. When Meta’s Pixel tool is embedded onto third-party websites, it tracks user activities, navigation patterns, and the specific information entered into the webpage. According to the lawsuit, Pixel harvests the data and sends it to Meta, which stores it on its servers. The benefits of this tactic to Meta are “far more sinister.” Particularly when the tool is incorporated onto a website without users’ consent, “Meta gains the ability to surreptitiously gather every user interaction with the website ranging from what a user clicks on to the personal information entered on a website,” according to the suit. “Meta aggregates this data against all websites,” the lawsuit explains. When incorporated onto medical websites and a user enters their health information into the hospital websites and patient portals, Pixel gathers appointments, treatments, medical conditions, diagnoses, procedures, test results, and provider information, among other healthcare data. The data is used by Meta, “as well as other parties, in connection with targeted advertising,” according to the suit. Pixel is embedded on 33 of the top 100 U.S. hospitals and on the patient portals of seven health systems, including UCSF Medical Center and Dignity Health Medical Foundation. The patient behind the suit claims her personal data and medical information that she entered into the Dignity Health and UCSF patient portals were harvested by the Pixel tool. The scraped data was used by Meta as part of the company’s advertising  business, for which the company profits from providing third parties with access to users most likely to be interested in their products or services. The patient alleges the company allowed pharmaceutical and other companies to target her with advertising tied to her medical conditions.  Further, the patient claims she received advertisements specifically tailored to her personal and health data which she entered into her patient portals. The ads were sent to her email and in text messages and appeared on her Facebook page. The lawsuit alleges that Meta is aware the user data collected by Pixel from Dignity Health and UCSF websites includes highly sensitive medical information, but continues to collect, use, and profit from the information “in reckless disregard for patient privacy.” Dignity Health and UCSF “knew by embedding Meta Pixel — a Meta advertising tool — they were sharing and permitting Meta to collect and use [patients’] data, including sensitive medical information,” according to the suit. As a result, their actions “constitute an extreme invasion of [patients’] right to privacy” and in violation of federal and state statutory and common law.  The lawsuit cites the Markup report detailing Pixel’s data scraping and its dubious use in targeted advertising against users, as well as views from industry stakeholders who call the practice “problematic” and a “likely Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act violation by the hospitals.” The lawsuit joins a growing number of Congressional inquiries examining the health data practices of Meta, health apps, and other platforms, as reports show patients increasingly want more control over their health data, especially after the upheaval of Roe. v.

39,,Founder Of Pro Russian Hacktivist Killnet Quitting Group,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33684/Founder-Of-Pro-Russian-Hacktivist-Killnet-Quitting-Group.html,"/08/1,","The founder and leader of the crowdsourced pro-Russian hacktivists Killnet announced his plans to leave the group after an upcoming hack and leak operation against Lockheed Martin. Killnet is part of a new breed of cyberwarfare that emerged during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While less surgical and less successful than their opposition equivalent, the I.T. Army of Ukraine, both are civilian groups disrupting non-combat organizations to pressure adversarial nations. Killnet is best known for DDoS attacks against a Connecticut airport, institutions in Lithuania and Norway and the official website of the U.S. Congress, which it took down for around two hours. ""Killnet has said in their statements on their Telegram channel and side channels the founder, KillMilk is moving on to protect the group, which I read as protecting them from law enforcement protection,"" said Bryce Webster-Jacobsen, director of intelligence operations at threat intel firm Groupsense. ""I don't buy that explanation."" The posts point Killnet members to new KillMilk channels where KillMilk claims to be starting a new group, so it does not appear that KillMilk is outright retiring. ""Most likely,"" said Webster-Jacobsen, ""This is an attempt to distance himself from international attention being paid to the group after the Lockheed operation — an attempt to distance themselves from the activity and C.Y.A., look out for yourself."" While Killnet is mostly known for DDoS attacks, the Lockheed Martin operation will, the group publically said, be a hack and leak operation. Webster-Jacobsen has not been able to assess that the group has its initial access, but he notes that Killnet leadership are not typically as confident as they seem to be about their potential success without genuine belief they can back it up. Killnet has announced its new leader will be ""BlackSide."" ""According to Killnet's official points of contact, BlackSide is the administrator of an unnamed cybercriminal special-access forum, which is allegedly hosted on the Tor network,"" said a private-sector analyst via email who asked to be kept anonymous to protect sourcing. ""They have announced that BlackSide is skilled in ransomware, phishing, and theft from European cryptocurrency exchanges."" ""'BlackSide',"" that analyst said, ""in the context of ransomware, is likely a tongue-in-cheek reference and portmanteau of the 'BlackMatter' and 'DarkSide' ransomware groups."" Because Killnet is crowdsourced from users of varying skill, experts believe there is a strong likelihood that the central strategy of DDoSes against perceived corporate and political infrastructure in nations aiding Ukraine. Killnet, said the analyst who asked to remain anonymous, very often claims responsibility for other groups attacks to create its own mythology. But, that analyst said, the expansive skillset Killnet claims BlackSide has could potentially mean new tactics for the group. ""We could see the integration of network intrusion, database exfiltration, and ransomware deployment tactics, techniques, and procedures into their operations. This is not out of the realm of possibility, as hacktivist and cybercriminal groups such as Network Battalion 65, Anonymous, XakNet, and others have been observed conducting similar activities,"" that analyst said. ""It is important to note that ransomware deployment is a complicated, multi-step, and time-consuming process. Due to Killnet's affinity for quick wins, it is unlikely that potential ransomware operations will be publicly discussed.""

40,,Ransomware Hit The American Dental Association,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33680/Ransomware-Hit-The-American-Dental-Association.html,29/07/2022,"The American Dental Association recently began notifying state regulators that the “cybersecurity incident” it reported in April was actually a ransomware attack, which led to the theft of member data. On April 23, ADA first reported to its members that a cybersecurity incident was causing technical issues and other disruptions for some of its clients, including the Texas and New York Dental Associations. In response, ADA shut down and isolated all of its systems, which affected the member-only access to the ADA and Texas Dental Association websites. TDA later confirmed the incident was definitely caused by a cyberattack deployed on April 21 and the groups were cooperating with federal authorities on a “vigorous investigation.” ADA later followed-up by stating it was also working with third-party cybersecurity specialists. At the time, ADA responded to rumors that data was stolen ahead of the hack by the Black Basta group by stressing that “a data breach has not occurred.” However, its recent notice confirms that data theft indeed occurred and includes additional details about the attack. The “sophisticated” ransomware attack disrupted only certain systems. On April 27, the investigation confirmed “certain information on ADA’s systems was accessed and/or acquired by an unauthorized actor.” The investigation into the extent of the breach did not conclude until June 10. The notice does not share the precise data impacted, just that it was personal information tied to member names. Impacted members will receive complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. ADA has since assessed its systems security and reset relevant account passwords, while it works to review and bolster its existing policies and procedures. The impact of the Eye Care Leaders data theft has now reached 3.03 million patients. Arkansas Retina recently reported 57,394 of its patients were affected by the December incident, and Sight Partners Physicians in Washington notified 86,101 patients. The ECL incident remains the largest healthcare data breach reported so far this year, impacting more than 35 eye care providers. The latest notices resemble the previously released notifications, including that the impacted providers weren’t notified of the December incident until April 15. Under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, business associates are required to inform covered entities of protected health information compromises within 60 days and without undue delay. The cyberattack began “on or about” Dec. 4, 2021, on some ECL databases where patient records were maintained. The subsequent investigation could not rule out whether the data was accessed or stolen by the attacker. The impacted providers ran reports on the practice management systems to identify the affected patient data, which included names, contact details, medical record numbers, treatments, diagnoses, prescriptions, and provider names, among other medical information. In response to the incident, Sight Partners ended its use of the ECL platforms, a response mirrored by about half of the impacted providers. All affected patients will receive free credit monitoring. As extensively reported, ECL is currently defending itself against a lawsuit filed by three providers that claim the vendor concealed multiple ransomware attacks and long periods of unscheduled downtime. An individual broke into a locked storage area at the Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center on May 20 and stole an iPad, as well as the password needed to access the device. As a result, 75,010 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Southern California patients are being notified that their data could be compromised. The stolen device was used at a COVID-19 testing site by employees and contained photos of COVID-19 lab specimen labels, which included patient names, dates of birth, medical record numbers, and the date and location of service. The iPad did not contain any photos of patients, lab results, Social Security numbers, or credit card numbers. The investigation didn’t find specific evidence the information was accessed or viewed by the thief, but are informing all patients whose data was stored on the stolen device. And Kaiser remotely erased all of the data from the stolen iPad including the photos. Kaiser has since relocated all its devices to a more secure location and strengthened its internal practices and procedures. Benson Health was hit by a cyberattack against its network on May 5, 2021, which led to the access of patient data for 28,913 patients. The North Carolina provider began issuing breach notices to patients beginning July 15, 2022, more than a year after the initial attack began. Upon discovering the incident, Benson Health launched an investigation with support from an outside third-party forensic specialist and a data mining firm to “perform an extensive and comprehensive review of the data set and identify individuals whose personal information was in that data set.” The investigation concluded June 7, 2022, which could explain the gap. But HIPAA is clear that notices must be sent to patients without undue delay and within 60 days after the breach was discovered — not at the close of an investigation. The forensics determined the accessed data included patient names, dates of birth, SSNs, and health or treatment information. All impacted patients will receive free credit monitoring services. In yet another apparent delayed notice, ATC Healthcare Services recently notified an undisclosed number of patients that their data was likely accessed or acquired during a December 2021 cyberattack. Notices were not sent until July 1, more than six months later. ATC first learned of the “criminal cyberattack” on Dec. 22, 2021, and promptly worked to secure its systems. The notification shows the attack impacted “email accounts.” The subsequent investigation could not conclusively rule out access or theft of patient data. ATC has since enhanced its systems security. The compromised information varied by patient and could include names, SSNs, driver's licenses, dates of birth, government-issued identification numbers, medical data, insurance information, employer-assigned identification number, and user credentials. Earlier this month, Associated Eye Care in Minnesota began notifying 40,793 patients that their data was compromised as far back as September 2020, after the hack of its cloud IT hosting, service, and solutions provider Netgain. The Netgain incident was one of the biggest healthcare data breaches reported in 2021, involving the theft of patient data that later returned to the vendor with “assurances that the data was deleted and destroyed.” At the time, the breach tally reached more than 865,000 individuals from multiple provider organizations. Entities first began notifying patients during the first half of 2021 of several Netgain security incidents that compromised patient data. In September last year, a hacker used stolen credentials to access the Netgain system and proliferated to a range of client environments that were connected to its system. During the dwell time, the attacker was able to steal a significant amount of patient information. The initial hack went undetected for several months before the attackers deployed ransomware onto the environment on Dec. 3, 2020, which was discovered soon after by Netgain. The investigation revealed the initial hacking and exfiltration of client and related patient data, which could include patient names, SSNs, dates of birth, contact details, driver’s licenses, and claims data that could reveal diagnoses and medical conditions. At the time, the hackers did demand a ransom payment from Netgain, which the vendor paid to regain patient data. The Associated Eye Care attributes the lengthy gap in reporting to “an extensive data mining project to identify all impacted individuals,” completed on May 16, 2022. AEC is currently reviewing and updating its server and systems security policies and procedures, in addition to its information life cycle management services. The incident led AEC to replace Netgain as its vendor and migrate the data and environment to another service provider. Earlier this month, Southwest Health Center in Wisconsin began notifying 46,142 patients that their data was possibly accessed and stolen during a “data security incident discovered on Jan. 11, 2022. Upon discovering the incident, the provider worked to secure the network and launched an investigation, which confirmed the possible exfiltration. Southwest Health then began “a comprehensive review of the data,” which concluded on May 27. Its unclear why the provider further delayed the notifications. The review found both personal and protected health information was likely stolen, which included names, SSNs, dates of birth, driver’s licenses, state identification card numbers, financial account numbers, medical data, and/or health insurance information. Southwest Health notified the FBI after the attack, which later informed the provider that the data servers involved in the incident were identified and confiscated. All affected patients will receive identity protection services for one to two years.",american dental associ recent began notifi state regul cybersecur incid report april actual ransomwar attack led

41,,Microsoft Exposes Tactics Of European Mercenary Spyware Broker,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33675/Microsoft-Exposes-Tactics-Of-European-Mercenary-Spyware-Broker.html,28/07/2022,"As a Congressional hearing meets Wednesday to discuss private contractors selling espionage spyware, and Reuters issued new reports such spyware was used to target the European Union's central lawmaking body, Microsoft is releasing details of a new campaign from an emerging contractor in the field. ""The NSO Group is the canonical example, but there are other companies included on the US Department of Commerce Entities List and a myriad of others that are selling these services that are not yet included on the List,"" Microsoft's Cristin Flynn Goodwin said in written testimony to the hearing. The new threat detailed by Microsoft in a blog post Wednesday is Austrian contractor DSIRF. DSIRF has marketed itself in the past as a threat intelligence operation with ""highly sophisticated techniques in gathering and analysing information, to support the decision-making"" of a tech, retail, financial and energy clientele. In practice, the company has been linked to sales of espionage malware, with media reports the group has marketed its ""Subzero"" malware to the Kremlin. The technical details behind Subzero had not been fully reported in the past. Microsoft says the group has been caught targeting ""law firms, banks, and strategic consultancies in countries such as Austria, the United Kingdom, and Panama."" Microsoft contacted a victim that confirmed it had not hired penetration testing services from DSIRF. ""It’s important to note that the identification of targets in a country doesn’t necessarily mean that a DSIRF customer resides in the same country, as international targeting is common,"" notes Microsoft's report. Microsoft tracks and investigates mercenary espionage actors nicknames using nicknames taken from plants. It has been referring to DSIRF as ""KNOTWEED."" Subzero appears to be distributed through a number of vectors, including vulnerabilities in Adobe and Windows products. Microsoft said it had patched at least four zero days being used by the group since 2021, with at least one zero day in Adobe used widely by the group.  In one case, a malicious DLL loaded in through a chain of zero days, was actually signed to DSIRF. DSIRF has also used VBA macros in Excel. The macros included obfuscation in the code by hiding commands in long passages of the Kama Sutra. Both the vulnerability chain and the Excel macro install downloader shellcode that uses an RC4 key hidden in a JPEG file – a meme depicting Kim Jung Un wondering if he can eat a guitar – to download CoreLump, an implant capable of keylogging, capturing screenshots, exfiltrating files, running a remote shell, and running arbitrary plugins. CoreLump installs JumpLump, a loader. CSIRF also utilizes a custom password stealer and ""Mex,"" software that wraps code from several common open source red team projects (Chisel, mimikatz , SharpHound3, Curl, Ping, Castle, SharpOxidResolver, Grouper2, Rubeus, PharpPrinter, Internal Monologue, SCShell, SpoolSample, Inveigh, Seatbelt, StandIn, Lockless and SharpExec) into a single tool. Beyond the code signing misstep linking the attacks to DSIRF, DSIRF also DNS infrastructure whose IPs resolved to its main corporate website and other DSIRF-linked sites. The Microsoft report recommends prioritizing patching the recent CVE-2022-22047, keeping antivirus up to date, and threat hunting using a full arsenal of methods it outlined.",congression hear meet wednesday discus privat contractor sell espionag spywar reuter issu new report spywar use target european union s central lawmak bodi microsoft releas detail new campaign emerg contractor field nso group canon exampl compani includ u depart commerc entiti list myriad other sell servic yet includ list microsoft s cristin flynn goodwin said written testimoni hear new threat detail microsoft blog post wednesday austrian contractor dsirf dsirf market past threat intellig oper high sophist techniqu gather analys inform support decisionmak tech retail financi energi clientel practic compani link sale espionag malwar medium report group market subzero malwar kremlin technic detail behind subzero fulli report past microsoft say group caught target law firm bank strateg consult countri austria unit kingdom panama microsoft contact victim confirm hire penetr test servic dsirf import note identif target countri necessarili mean dsirf custom resid countri intern target common note microsoft s report microsoft track investig mercenari espionag actor nicknam use nicknam taken plant refer dsirf knotwe subzero appear distribut number vector includ vulner adob window product microsoft said patch least four zero day use group sinc least one zero day adob use wide group one case malici dll load chain zero day actual sign dsirf dsirf also use vba macro excel macro includ obfusc code hide command long passag kama sutra vulner chain excel macro instal download shellcod us rc key hidden jpeg file – meme depict kim jung un wonder eat guitar – download corelump implant capabl keylog captur screenshot exfiltr file run remot shell run arbitrari plugin corelump instal jumplump loader csirf also util custom password stealer mex softwar wrap code sever common open sourc red team project chisel mimikatz sharphound curl ping castl sharpoxidresolv grouper rubeus pharpprint intern monologu scshell spoolsampl inveigh seatbelt standin lockless sharpexec singl tool beyond code sign misstep link attack dsirf dsirf also dns infrastructur whose ip resolv main corpor websit dsirflink site microsoft report recommend priorit patch recent cve keep antivirus date threat hunt use full arsenal method outlin ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'microsoft', 'spyware']"
42,,Inside The Energy Department's 10-Year Plan To Reshape Cybersecurity In The Sector,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33674/Inside-The-Energy-Departments-10-Year-Plan-To-Reshape-Cybersecurity-In-The-Sector.html,28/07/2022,"Everybody loves the idea of modernizing IT and cybersecurity. Few industries or sectors have the money, resources, patience or follow through to carry it out in more than a piecemeal fashion. Nowhere is that more true than in critical infrastructure and the energy sector, where the perpetual need to keep the lights and power running has locked the industry into insecure technologies and network architectures that were developed decades ago. Back in 2013, the Obama administration identified the energy sector as “uniquely critical due to the enabling functions they provide across all critical infrastructure sectors.” Meanwhile, state-backed and criminal hacking groups have gotten better, faster and more emboldened to target the networks and automated systems built on top of that infrastructure. Incidents such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack have reinforced longstanding fears in government that even individual hacks can cause widespread supply chain disruptions and shortages. Now, officials at the Department of Energy say they are looking to leverage billions of dollars in federal funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed last year in a bid to replace and reshape much of the underlying technologies and processes that underpin our national power system. “Any time you’re on the cusp of introducing new technology or on the cusp of significant spending [or] investing in infrastructure upgrades, that’s the time where you really want to think strategically,” Cheri Caddy, a senior advisor for cybersecurity policy and strategy at the Department of Energy, told SC Media in an interview. “How do I optimize my spending not just for efficiency…but use that occasion, that strategic opportunity to think about building secure?” Caddy and other Energy officials have described the infrastructure law as a “once in a generation opportunity” to overhaul and modernize large swaths of the energy sector’s IT and cybersecurity. In order to do so, experts say the department and its cyber wing CESER (the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response) will need to navigate a complex and competitive funding environment to ensure that states, local governments, private companies and utilities are following through on the strategy. Much of the public discussion from the White House and Congress around energy investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law has been focused not around cybersecurity or IT but rather clean energy, developing technologies with greater energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of a sector that the United Nations has classified as the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the world. In January, President Joe Biden touted the benefits of the law to the energy sector, mentioning renewable energy labs in Colorado, new and upgraded power transmission lines and towers and wind energy. In February, he gave a speech in Ohio touting the law and how it “helps us invest in a cleaner, stronger, more resilient electric grid, with 100% clean electric energy being generated by the year 2035.” Neither speech made mention of technology or cybersecurity upgrades. But the ground-level guidance the administration developed for state and local governments makes it clear that the White House sees billions of dollars in federal funding from the law that can be unlocked to make cybersecurity-specific upgrades to energy infrastructure. According to a guidebook the administration released in January, the law sets aside at least $1.3 billion to fund cybersecurity resilience measures. It also includes $1 billion for state and local cybersecurity grants, $250 million for energy sector cyber research and development, $250 million for rural and municipal utility cyber and technical assistance, $100 million for a cyber response and recovery fund overseen by the Department of Homeland Security, and $50 million for energy sector cyber resilience support. Beyond that, scores of individual project descriptions include specific language that allows the federal government or downstream recipients to use money allocated to grant funding for industrial research, port development and others for cybersecurity related purposes. The spending on cybersecurity “is spread across multiple programs to strengthen cyber systems and defense against future attacks, including funding for State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial grants for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, cyber response and recovery, and Research & Development in cyber,” the guidebook states. “We’re really looking to [ask] as we’re beginning to move all that infrastructure money and execute on it: how do we infuse security into those discussions?” said Caddy. “So, it’s less a specific technology or specific project that’s being advocated here but more how do we look across the board as we’re making investments across the department — at putting more renewables in place, at decarbonizing the grid, and updating outdated infrastructure. For any particular project that’s doing those things, let’s also put cybersecurity into the mix, into the qualifications, so we’re pursuing those multiple goals at once.”  The status quo has been decades in the making, the product of multiple factors, including the energy sector’s historical prioritization on reliability and physical safety over cybersecurity, a lack of human expertise and the increased reliance on newer automated technologies that have opened up new attack surfaces within energy utilities for malicious hackers to exploit. Malware designed to attack the machinery and networking that help to run modern essential services is still rare, but that’s starting to change. One of the latest examples happened in April, when cybersecurity firms Dragos and Mandiant announced they had discovered what is believed to be just the seventh piece of ICS-specific malware found in the wild, dubbed PIPEDREAM. While there was no evidence the tool was deployed before it was discovered, researchers said it targeted programmable logic controllers made by Schneider Electric and Omron, was capable of disrupting, degrading or even destroying data and leveraged vulnerabilities that are inherent in many other commercial controllers. Mandiant compared it to some of the most dangerous malware known to target industrial control systems, such as Triton, Industroyer and Stuxnet. Michael Dransfield, a senior technical executive for control systems cybersecurity at the NSA, said earlier this month that his agency is “seeing more and more capabilities that are available either open source or being developed by our adversaries” specifically designed to target critical infrastructure and industrial control systems. That’s in part because energy utilities, like other sectors, are facing a shortage of workers who understand both cybersecurity and the technical and business realities of operating critical infrastructure. While modernization of the underlying technology is one component of the plan for safer energy, any effective strategy for creating more secure electrical grids and other energy assets will need to account for the lack of human expertise that is increasingly being replaced with digital, remote systems. “Back in 2003, you had operators who really didn’t understand the cybersecurity problem and you had cybersecurity individuals who really worked in the IT world, but did not really understand what operational technology or control systems were,” said Dransfield. “We’ve made progress bringing those two groups together [but] the problem is a lot of the … seasoned veterans who work in the operational technology world have retired, and so within the U.S. we have begun to rely more and more on automated control systems.” Building security-native technologies and processes to better protect those systems is essential and need not conflict with broader goals around climate. According to CESER Director Puesh Kumar, the plan is to ensure that as states and energy companies go about replacing their equipment, machinery and operational technology with more climate-friendly alternatives, they are also working to undo some of the early design mistakes that have plagued industry cybersecurity for decades. The department “is going to be investing over $62 billion over the next five- to 10 years in the U.S. energy sector and specifically the electric grid, and so this is the time to do it.” “From my vantage point, we honestly have a strategic opportunity like we’ve never had before. We’re seeing this revolution of particularly clean energy systems that are going to be coming online and we have an opportunity to actually build in cybersecurity rather than trying to bolt it on that we’ve done in so many other sectors, including the energy sector, for too long,” said Kumar in July during an online event hosted by Nozomi Networks. With cybersecurity, the best laid plans set out by any government or industry are largely dependent on the ability to wrangle and persuade other stakeholders. Governments can regulate but don’t own most of the infrastructure or make any of the underlying technologies. Private industry can innovate and has the money, but has historically lacked the financial incentives to do so. Utilities often lack access to cybersecurity-specific funding and have a duty to keep operations running that complicate any widespread modernization plans. Trevor Rudolph, vice president for global digital public policy at Schneider Electric, told SC Media that while federal dollars can help with some of the biggest challenges to energy modernization, they wouldn't address other core issues — like service continuity — that are often the biggest roadblocks to modernization at scale. “A lot of the systems and infrastructure that Energy is talking about, there is zero tolerance for downtime. Utilities are having to deal with the challenge where, yes, they want to upgrade, yes they want to replace certain systems but they can’t afford even a second of downtime with their existing infrastructure,” said Rudolph, who also worked as chief of the cyber and national security unit at the Office of Management and Budget. Then there is the question of follow through. Rudolph said the process of getting that funding down to different stakeholders in the energy industry and used for cybersecurity specific investments is “more complicated” than anything he experienced while in government. Energy’s statutory authority to tell owners and operators what to do when prioritizing upgrades is “tenuous at best.” The money from the infrastructure law will flow down to states, local governments, utilities, and other stakeholders, often in the form of grant funding that can be spent in a variety of different ways. That means that in some cases, those entities must voluntarily follow through on the federal government’s plans.  There is already evidence of a split between Democrats and Republicans over how much control the White House and executive branch can wield over the money that will be spent by states and utilities. In February, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., sent a letter to governors around the country urging them to ignore the Biden administration’s guidance on how to utilize funding from the infrastructure law on road and highway investments, saying a December 2021 memorandum from the Federal Highway Administration outlining how states should allocate spending “attempts to implement a wish list of policies not reflected” in the law. Congress wrote the law to give states and localities ample flexibility to spend those dollars how they see fit and the senators stressed that guidance from the executive branch is not legally binding unless it’s backed up in the letter of the law. The administration’s guidance “is an internal document, has no effect of law, and states should treat it as such,” McConnell and Capito wrote. One area where that flexibility could ultimately benefit cybersecurity is around the “Buy America” provisions in the law. Heath Knakmuhs, vice president and policy counsel of the Global Energy Institute at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that money allocated to buy and install new climate-friendly parts and components within energy infrastructure may conflict with the law’s requirements that utilities buy domestically manufactured products. There is also still considerable uncertainty about how the administration intends to issue waivers that allow companies and utilities to bypass those rules. The Chamber and 11 other organizations have submitted at least 46 questions to OMB regarding how the “Buy America” provisions will be implemented. With the way climate supply chains are set up, it may conflict with the law’s broader Buy America rules, said Knakmuhs in an interview. If that money can’t be used for climate, it may wind up going to other priorities including cybersecurity. “Because a lot of those components that are necessary for solar and inverters and even in wind turbine technology and critical minerals … required for batteries and other modern technologies are all from overseas for the most part,” he said. “The Buy American guidance in that is probably the most impactful tool on the cyber side quite honestly. It is going to depend on how they interpret it, where do they like to grant waivers, where do they like not to grant waivers.” The project is expected to take a decade if not more, but officials at Energy believe it represents a singular chance to shore up the resilience of one of the most vital sectors in American society. Climate and green energy still appear to be the clear spending priorities for the administration, but officials at CESER say there is no reason that the sector can’t take advantage of the law to solve some of its other most enduring problems at the same time. “You have a lot of these trends coming together to make this an optimal point in time, and now of course with the infrastructure bill we’re beginning to make those investments,” said Caddy. ""So [the question is] how do we use the occasion of having a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest, to get more efficient from an economic standpoint, but also efficient from renewables and green technology standpoint, and also build secure? We can do all of these things together.”",everybodi love idea modern cybersecur industri sector money resourc patienc follow carri piecem fashion nowher true critic infrastructur energi sector perpetu

43,,"Microsoft Again Reverses Course, Will Block Macros By Default",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33662/Microsoft-Again-Reverses-Course-Will-Block-Macros-By-Default.html,25/07/2022,"Three weeks ago, Microsoft said it would pause its rollout of a new security feature loved by security experts but feared by smaller enterprises: Blocking VBA macros by default from all documents downloaded from the internet. The pause is over. A blog post released last week slates the rollout of the feature will begin for general users on July 27. VBA macros provide additional programming functionality for programs like Excel. But adding code that will run when an otherwise innocuous-looking document is opened has proved to be dangerous. Macros have been a top vector for attack since the Concept malware in 1995. ""By any measure, email continues to be the prevailing vector leveraged by adversaries for initial access, leading to a wide variety of damaging cyberattacks,"" Brian Donohue, principal security specialist at Red Canary, told SC Media via email when the pause was first announced. Microsoft's update will tag documents downloaded from the internet for additional user scrutiny before running macros. When such a file is opened, Microsoft will put a red banner at the top of the page saying that macros have been blocked with a link to an article explaining why they are dangerous and how to re-enable macros for the file if the user thinks they are safe. Some enterprises, particularly smaller enterprises, were concerned that this would jam workflows without giving enterprises time to adapt. ""You'll want to identify those macros and determine what steps to take to keep using those macros. You'll also want to work with independent software vendors (ISVs) that provide macros in Office files from those locations. For example, to see if they can digitally sign their code and you can treat them as a trusted publisher,"" Microsoft wrote in its latest blog. There is evidence that even just the specter of macros becoming a less effective vector has forced criminal groups to adapt.

44,,Authentication Weakness Responsible For 80% Of Financial Breaches,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33656/Authentication-Weakness-Responsible-For-80-Of-Financial-Breaches.html,21/07/2022,"Despite the ongoing move to multi-factor authentication (MFA), the financial sector still faces a significant problem when it comes to breaches related to identification compromise, according to one recent research report. Released July 13, the authentication in financial services study discovered that U.S. and European financial institutions experienced an average of 3.4 significant breaches within the past year, costing these banks, credit unions and investment firms on average $2.19 million annually in losses and remediation (which does not even account for so-called “intangible and hidden costs”). However, more troubling is that the report found that 8 in 10 of these breaches were related to a “weakness in authentication.” Hypr commissioned Vanson Bourne for the research included in ""The State of Authentication in the Finance Industry 2022."" The research alleges that at the heart of this problem, financial firms have become too “complacent” about authentication practices in the face of an exponential rise (in some cases) of cyberattacks and a rising level of sophistication from cybercriminals. “Findings uncover the burden that current authentication practices are leaving on financial organizations globally, specifically the high-risk cracks in security, strain on budgets and overall operational disruption,” according to a press release announcing the report. “More importantly,” it continued, “the results identify the discrepancies around 'perceived' and 'actual' authentication security.” An “alarming” (if not shocking — given recent headlines) 85% of the financial organization respondents faced a cyber breach in the past 12 months, according to findings. However, perhaps more astonishing, more than 7 out of 10 (72%) experienced multiple breaches within the same timeframe. And yet, 9 out of 10 of these breached enterprises still insist that their existing authentication approach is secure, “despite data proving otherwise.” Despite this seeming disconnect, financial services veterans in IT security still maintain that the industry can and will regain its edge in terms of improving authentication, and thereby reduce the success and impact of subsequent cyberattacks. “The finance industry is at the forefront of cybersecurity,” David Reilly, security and financial services strategic advisor and former CIO and CTO for Bank of America, said in Hypr’s prepared release. “As one of the most targeted sectors for attack, financial services companies have an impressive track record of adopting new, innovative defense technologies to deliver the protection that clients need.” The report’s additional major findings include: 36% of respondents reported phishing as the “most prevalent type of attack,” followed by malware and credential stuffing, which each accounted for 31% of breaches; and push notification attacks, which accounted for 29%. The study also uncovered that nearly one-third of these organizations “lost customers to their competitors,” while 29% lost at least one employee and roughly one-quarter (26%) of them have lost customer data after they were breached. More promising, nearly 9 out of 10 study respondents (89%) said that they“believe that passwordless MFA offers the highest level of authentication security.” “While improvements in perimeter, network and behavioral analytics have advanced, authentication security has not moved at the same pace,” Reilly added in his statement. “We now have the opportunity to make a step-function change and improve authentication security by removing the risk of static passwords and credentials which can be learned and leveraged by attackers. Eliminating the static password risk is the strategic path forward.” The report was based on interviews with 500 IT security decision-makers in the financial sector based in the United States, United Kingdom, France and Germany.",despit ongo move multifactor authent mfa financi sector still face signific problem come breach relat identif compromis accord one recent research report releas juli authent financi servic studi discov u european financi institut experienc averag signific breach within past year cost bank credit union invest firm averag million annual loss remedi even account socal intang hidden cost howev troubl report found breach relat weak authent hypr commiss vanson bourn research includ state authent financ industri research alleg heart problem financi firm becom complac authent practic face exponenti rise case cyberattack rise level sophist cybercrimin find uncov burden current authent practic leav financi organ global specif highrisk crack secur strain budget overal oper disrupt accord press releas announc report import continu result identifi discrep around perceiv actual authent secur alarm shock — given recent headlin financi organ respond face cyber breach past month accord find howev perhap astonish experienc multipl breach within timefram yet breach enterpris still insist exist authent approach secur despit data prove otherwis despit seem disconnect financi servic veteran secur still maintain industri regain edg term improv authent therebi reduc success impact subsequ cyberattack financ industri forefront cybersecur david reilli secur financi servic strateg advisor former cio cto bank america said hypr prepar releas one target sector attack financi servic compani impress track record adopt new innov defens technolog deliv protect client need report addit major find includ respond report phish preval type attack follow malwar credenti stuf account breach push notif attack account studi also uncov near onethird organ lost custom competitor lost least one employe rough onequart lost custom data breach promis near studi respond said believ passwordless mfa offer highest level authent secur improv perimet network behavior analyt advanc authent secur move pace reilli ad statement opportun make stepfunct chang improv authent secur remov risk static password credenti learn leverag attack elimin static password risk strateg path forward report base interview secur decisionmak financi sector base unit state unit kingdom franc germani ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'bank', 'data loss']"
45,,National Data Privacy Law Draws Mixed Reactions,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33655/National-Data-Privacy-Law-Draws-Mixed-Reactions.html,21/07/2022,"The House Energy and Commerce Committee advanced major data privacy legislation Wednesday along with two other bills that would compel federal reporting on cross-border ransomware complaints and require IoT vendors to warn consumers about surveillance components in the connected devices they manufacture. The top item on the docket was the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, the House’s version of a comprehensive privacy bill that congressional Democrats are seeking to advance. The committee voted overwhelmingly (53-2) in favor of the bill, and committee leaders from both parties hailed the passage as a landmark moment and opportunity in U.S. digital privacy. “Today’s vote has been years in the making and is a major step forward in our bipartisan effort to establish national data privacy protections for all Americans,” said Reps. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.; Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash.; Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill.; and Gus Bikirakis, R-Fla.; in a joint statement. “The American Data Privacy and Protection Act puts people back in control of their online data. It creates a strong national standard that will finally minimize the amount of Americans’ information companies are allowed to collect, process, and transfer. This will rein in Big Tech’s power and establish clear, robust protections for people, especially children. Under our solution, companies will face real consequences if they track our kids’ data or use that information to exploit them for profit.” Reactions to the House bill highlights the intense interest and wrangling the legislation has spawned among interest groups across the spectrum, where digital civil liberties organizations are warning it contains significant loopholes that could still permit the kind of invasive data consumer data collection that lawmakers are attempting to address while business and tech groups are lobbying for further changes that are more friendly to industry. The American Civil Liberties Union has praised parts of the bill that seek to limit algorithmic bias and require companies to implement “privacy-by-design” concepts into their software and other products. But in a letter this week ahead of the markup, the organization said there are still too many provisions that allow companies to harvest user or employee data and limitations to a private right of action may impede many individuals from suing to enforce other parts of law, like requiring impact assessments and design evaluations of algorithms. “The ACLU greatly appreciates the work and commitment to privacy and nondiscrimination reflected in the ADPPA, but at the same time, we also have serious concerns about the likely effect of several provisions,"" Christopher Anders, ACLU’s federal policy director, wrote in a letter this week ahead of the markup. “Importantly, all of the problems can be fixed.” Meanwhile, John Miller, senior vice president of policy and general counsel at the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association representing many of the largest technology companies in the country, put out a statement that offered qualified support for the broad thrust of the House bill, saying the version that passed out of committee Wednesday “improves upon earlier drafts in certain areas” and would be a genuine boon for data privacy, but also stressed that the group intended to continue to press for further changes. “However, more work needs to be done to improve provisions regarding the regulation of algorithms and targeted advertising, and to further clarify the responsibilities of service providers before the bill advances further,” said Miller, who has also provided testimony to lawmakers around the bill in House hearings last month. “While the bill as written provides meaningful privacy protections to American consumers, progress on privacy should not come at the expense of undermining innovation in artificial intelligence and potentially threatening national competitiveness.” The RANSOMWARE (or the Reporting Attacks from Nations Selected for Oversight and Monitoring Web Attacks and Ransomware from Enemies) Act passed unanimously through the committee. It would require the Federal Trade Commission to report biennially to Congress on the number and detail of cross-border it receives on ransomware and other cyberattacks committed by foreign nations as well as any efforts it has made to engage with law enforcement agencies or courts in other nations cooperate on investigation and prosecution of the responsible parties.   The bill specifically singles out four nations — Russia, China, North Korea and Iran — that have been at the forefront of discussions in Washington around state-use of ransomware and the responsibility governments have for the actions of malicious cyber groups operating within their borders. “My bill will help Congress, the FTC and other law enforcement entities better understand these attacks and learn to how to better combat them,” said Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., the legislation’s chief sponsor. The panel also unanimously voted in favor of the Informing Consumers About Smart Devices Act, introduced last year by Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah. It would require manufacturers of internet-connected devices to disclose to consumers whether it includes a photo or video camera. It would not include devices that commonly have cameras built-in, such as mobile phones, laptops or devices specifically marketed and sold as cameras. The bill gives the FTC the authority to fine or punish violators and charges the agency with developing more specific guidance for manufacturers within six months of passage. “I don’t want my refrigerator or my microwave or whatever to be feeding to someone somewhere in the world what I’m doing every single minute of my day, and I want the right to know if those microphones and cameras are in devices,” said Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., who also supported the bill.",hous energi commerc committe advanc major data privaci legisl wednesday along two bill would compel feder report crossbord ransomwar complaint requir iot vendor warn consum surveil compon connect devic manufactur top item docket american data privaci protect act hous version comprehens privaci bill congression democrat seek advanc committe vote overwhelm favor bill committe leader parti hail passag landmark moment opportun u digit privaci today vote year make major step forward bipartisan effort establish nation data privaci protect american said rep frank pallon dnj cathi mcmorri rodger rwash jan schakowski dill gu bikiraki rfla joint statement american data privaci protect act put peopl back control onlin data creat strong nation standard final minim amount american inform compani allow collect process transfer rein big tech power establish clear robust protect peopl especi child solut compani face real consequ track kid data use inform exploit profit reaction hous bill highlight intens interest wrangl legisl spawn among interest group across spectrum digit civil liberti organ warn contain signific loophol could still permit kind invas data consum data collect lawmak attempt address busi tech group lobbi chang friend industri american civil liberti union prais part bill seek limit algorithm bias requir compani implement privacybydesign concept softwar product letter week ahead markup organ said still mani provis allow compani harvest user employe data limit privat right action may imped mani individu su enforc part law like requir impact assess design evalu algorithm aclu great appreci work commit privaci nondiscrimin reflect adppa time also serious concern like effect sever provis christoph ander aclu feder polici director wrote letter week ahead markup import problem fix meanwhil john miller senior vice presid polici general counsel inform technolog industri council trade associ repres mani largest technolog compani countri put statement offer qualifi support broad thrust hous bill say version pass committe wednesday improv upon earlier draft certain area would genuin boon data privaci also stress group intend continu press chang howev work need done improv provis regard regul algorithm target advertis clarifi respons servic provid bill advanc said miller also provid testimoni lawmak around bill hous hear last month bill written provid meaning privaci protect american consum progress privaci come expens undermin innov artifici intellig potenti threaten nation competit ransomwar report attack nation select oversight monitor web attack ransomwar enemi act pass unanim committe would requir feder trade commiss report biennial congress number detail crossbord receiv ransomwar cyberattack commit foreign nation well effort made engag law enforc agenc court nation cooper investig prosecut respons parti bill specif singl four nation — russia china north korea iran — forefront discuss washington around stateus ransomwar respons govern action malici cyber group oper within border bill help congress ftc law enforc entiti better understand attack learn better combat said rep michael biliraki rfla legisl chief sponsor panel also unanim vote favor inform consum smart devic act introduc last year rep john curti rutah would requir manufactur internetconnect devic disclos consum whether includ photo video camera would includ devic common camera builtin mobil phone laptop devic specif market sold camera bill give ftc author fine punish violat charg agenc develop specif guidanc manufactur within six month passag want refriger microwav whatev feed someon somewher world everi singl minut day want right know microphon camera devic said rep debbi lesko rariz also support bill ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa']"

47,,White House To Hold Summit On Addressing The Thousands Of Unfilled Cybersecurity Jobs,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33642/White-House-To-Hold-Summit-On-Addressing-The-Thousands-Of-Unfilled-Cybersecurity-Jobs.html,19/07/2022,"The Biden administration has already hosted expansive summits on ransomware and open-source software security. Now it’s taking a similar approach in an attempt to tackle problems in the cybersecurity workforce. On Tuesday, the White House will bring experts, private sector companies and federal agencies together to brainstorm around one of the most pressing challenges in cybersecurity: people or, more accurately, the lack of them. The meeting will be led by National Cyber Director Chris Inglis and includes leadership from the Departments of Homeland Security, Commerce and Labor, as well as Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; Anne Neuberger, White House deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology; Susan Rice, director of the Domestic Policy Council; and James Kvaal, undersecretary of education. While the total number varies depending on the source, most estimates peg the shortage of qualified cybersecurity workers in the hundreds of thousands. CyberSeek, a non-profit organization backed by the National Institute for Cybersecurity Education that maps job openings, currently flags more than 714,000 open or unfilled cybersecurity positions around the country. It’s a problem that impacts both governments and businesses alike and is happening as both sectors are attempting to coalesce around ambitious long-term plans to increase the resiliency of systems and data against nation-state and criminal hackers alike. “With approximately 700,000 cybersecurity positions open, America faces a national security challenge that must be tackled aggressive. During the summit, participants will help chart a path toward a more secure future in which all Americans have the opportunity to raise the bar on cybersecurity through greater awareness, education, and training,” the White House said in the announcement. “The summit will also serve as a call to action — to ensure that all Americans can capitalize on the benefits of the digital domain and to ensure that our nation carries through on the positive opportunities ahead of us.” They will be joined by executives from the private sector and experts from academia and the cyber community, though the White House says more announcements on that front are forthcoming. Thus far, SC Media has confirmed that Barbara Massa, executive vice president of business operations at Mandiant, will be in attendance, as will Heather Adkins, vice president of security engineering at Google. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment and directed SC Media to the White House. The summit will focus on three core challenges that have kept the supply of cybersecurity talent from keeping up with demand. One is finding a way to better utilize trade schools, apprenticeships, community colleges and other non-traditional educational institutions to create new skill-based pathways into a cybersecurity career. Another will look at tapping into underserved and diverse communities, including women and people of color, who have long been underrepresented in the field and industry leaders are working to make the field more welcoming to other backgrounds. Finally, the meeting will look at how to invest wisely in educational initiatives to ensure American workers are trained to succeed and stay secure in a digital economy, regardless of whether they work directly in cybersecurity or other fields. While more cyber practitioners are badly needed, a massive part of any organization’s attack surface comes from the actions and decisions of their non-cyber employees, who can often upend millions of dollars in security spending by clicking on a malicious link. As Inglis put it earlier this year when discussing the need for fundamental skills up and down the workforce: “We don't necessarily need to make [everyone] a python programmer —  but that we make them cyber aware."" Boosting the national cyber workforce has been a long-held goal for the Biden administration as well as its predecessor, the Trump administration. There are few, if any, straightforward solutions to the problem, at least in the short-term. More and more of our national infrastructure is being put under the control or direction of potentially vulnerable software, or connected to the internet, where it's within reach for state-backed or criminal hacking groups. But the often highly technical work needed to secure those systems is being carried out by an increasingly smaller proportion of the workforce. There is no easy method to quickly teach or acclimate new workers the fundamentals of cybersecurity or the IT and networking principles that underpin them. That means that even as companies and agencies are desperate to fill open roles, they’re often not willing to put the security of their organization or its customers in the hands of a novice. Some have questioned whether untrained or undertrained cybersecurity workers would ultimately be a net boon or drag on companies remains an active debate. Jake Williams, a former hacker at the National Security Agency and current executive director of threat intelligence at Scythe, has argued that putting untrained or lightly trained cybersecurity workers on the job is irresponsible and wouldn’t be accepted in other fields where safety and competence are considered core priorities. ""Your airline pilot started in a single engine Cessna. Nobody called it gatekeeping. And before that, they learned lots of ‘mostly irrelevant’ facts in ground training,” Williams remarked last week on Twitter. “Cyber is one of the only fields where we pretend that skipping the basics is okay to put butts in seats.” In an email, Williams told SC Media he thinks the government and military actually do a very good job of recruiting and training cyber employees but ""for the commercial workforce, the situation is a bit more bleak."" That's in part due to what Williams, who is also a senior instructor in digital forensics at the SANS Institute, characterized as the poor state of many commercial cybersecurity training programs that churn out degrees without ensuring that graduates are being properly schooled on the fundamentals of IT security that they require before they can be trusted with protecting an organization's sensitive data. ""Those trying to break into the cybersecurity field, often lament that employers need to 'be realistic about skills' and 'take a chance on someone with passion to learn.' The unfortunate reality is that [small and medium-sized businesses], many of which are making their first security hire, simply cannot afford to hire people without a broader cross section of security knowledge and/or experience. This leaves a disconnect between expectations and reality for many cybersecurity bootcamp graduates. Others have called for the country to respond with a mass mobilization effort to train a generation of cybersecurity workers and put them in a position to gain experience as they work. James Lewis, senior vice president and director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said last month that the U.S. is not “serious” about solving the cyber workforce shortage and won’t get anywhere near closing the gap by relying on slower, more traditional means of education or training. He drew a comparison to efforts by the U.S. military during World War II to train an entire generation of pilots to compete with Germany, Japan and others for dominance of the skies. There is no initiative on the part of policymakers to do something similar with cybersecurity, while shortages and competition with the private sector for qualified workers only continues to grow. “You need to create a pipeline, you need to put untrained bodies at the front, and you need to have pilots come out the other end, and you need to do that at scale and we’re not doing that,” Lewis said.",biden administr alreadi host expans summit ransomwar opensourc softwar secur take similar approach attempt tackl problem cybersecur workforc tuesday white hous bring expert privat sector

48,,Tenet Health Sued Over Health Data Theft Impacting 1.2M,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33636/Tenet-Health-Sued-Over-Health-Data-Theft-Impacting-1.2M.html,15/07/2022,"A lawsuit has been filed against Tenet Healthcare and its Texas affiliate Baptist Health System following Tenet's breach notification to 1.2 million patients that their data was stolen during a systems’ hack in March.  The patient who filed the lawsuit is seeking $1 million in monetary relief for the class action and claims his individual damages are less than $75,000. Filed in the District Court of Dallas County, the suit claims the stolen data was not encrypted ahead of the cyberattack. It should be noted that under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act data encryption is not required if the provider has a documented, alternative security mechanism in place. As previously reported, Baptist Medical Center and Resolute Health Hospital first discovered a systems’ intrusion on April 20, several weeks after the incident began. A threat actor installed malicious code on certain network systems, prompting the provider to suspend user access to the affected IT applications. The investigation into the intrusion found the attackers used their weeks-long access to remove data containing patient information from the network. While the stolen data did not include any driver’s licenses, credit and debit card information, or bank account details, it may have involved Social Security numbers, demographics, contact details, health insurance information, medical record numbers, dates of service, diagnoses, treatments, facility names, reason for visit, claims data, billing codes, and other sensitive data. The notice shows the providers improved their monitoring capabilities and systems security after the incident, something the lawsuit argues should have happened ahead of the hack. “On information and belief, BHS and its employees failed to properly monitor the computer network and IT systems that housed the private information,” according to the suit. In addition, the patient data was maintained in a “condition vulnerable to a cyberattack.” The lawsuit goes on to claim the hospitals were aware their systems’ security mechanisms were a “known risk” and thus, officials were “on notice that failing to take steps necessary to secure the private information from those risks left that property in a dangerous condition.” Notably, the lawsuit aruges that patients were not notified of the breach in a timely fashion. However, Baptist Health issued its notification well within the requirements outlined in HIPAA: within 60 days of discovery and without undue delay. As a result of the data theft and “negligent conduct,” the impacted patients argue that they’re at a heighten risk of identity theft as the data is now in the hands of threat actors. The data could be used for a number of fraudulent activities, including opening accounts or taking out loans in the victims’ names. The data may also be used to target victim with other phishing campaigns. Although the lawsuit claims the breach victims have “been exposed to a heightened and imminent risk of fraud and identity theft,” it fails to provide any specific details of actual harm experienced by the patients as a direct result of the incident. In June 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that only individuals “concretely harmed” by a breach violation have standing to seek damages against an entity. The lawsuit is seeking compensatory damages, reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs, and injunctive relief, which could include requirements for the hospital to improve its systems security, submit to annual audits, and provide victims with adequate credit monitoring services.",lawsuit file tenet healthcar texa affili baptist health system follow tenet s breach notif million patient data stolen system hack march patient file lawsuit seek million monetari relief class action claim individu damag le file district court dalla counti suit claim stolen data encrypt ahead cyberattack note health insur portabl account act data encrypt requir provid document altern secur mechan place previous report baptist medic center resolut health hospit first discov system intrus april sever week incid began threat actor instal malici code certain network system prompt provid suspend user access affect applic investig intrus found attack use weekslong access remov data contain patient inform network stolen data includ driver licens credit debit card inform bank account detail may involv social secur number demograph contact detail health insur inform medic record number date servic diagnosi treatment facil name reason visit claim data bill code sensit data notic show provid improv monitor capabl system secur incid someth lawsuit argu happen ahead hack inform belief bh employe fail proper monitor comput network system hous privat inform accord suit addit patient data maintain condit vulner cyberattack lawsuit go claim hospit awar system secur mechan known risk thus offici notic fail take step necessari secur privat inform risk left properti danger condit notabl lawsuit arug patient notifi breach time fashion howev baptist health issu notif well within requir outlin hipaa within day discoveri without undu delay result data theft neglig conduct impact patient argu heighten risk ident theft data hand threat actor data could use number fraudul activ includ open account take loan victim name data may also use target victim phish campaign although lawsuit claim breach victim expos heighten immin risk fraud ident theft fail provid specif detail actual harm experienc patient direct result incid june suprem court rule individu concret harm breach violat stand seek damag entiti lawsuit seek compensatori damag reimburs outofpocket cost injunct relief could includ requir hospit improv system secur submit annual audit provid victim adequ credit monitor servic ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'data loss']"

Will Attackers Use It?,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33629/New-Spectre-Type-Retbleed-Vulnerability-Drops.-Will-Attackers-Use-It.html,13/07/2022,"Researchers at Swiss university ETH Zurich announced a new addition to the Spectre Variant 2 family of bugs affecting Intel and AMD processors. Spectre made a big splash in the media when first announced in 2018. Since then, several spins on the vulnerability have been discovered and subsequently mitigated. The family works by exploiting the speculative calculations processors use to boost speed by pre-processing multiple possible paths a program might go rather than waiting for the program to choose which one to focus on. The ETH Zurich vulnerability, discovered by doctoral student Johannes Wikner and professor Kaveh Razavi, focuses on instructions that return a program to the correct place in memory. As such, they dubbed the vulnerability ""Retbleed."" Wikner and Razevi will present their paper and proof of concept for Retbleed at USENIX in August.  Retbleed potentially impacts three- to six-year-old Intel processors and one- to 11-year-old AMDs. While Spectre received a lot of attention due to its massive potential impact, attacks never really materialized. They may have been too complex, too publicized and too quickly addressed to ever become a staple of attacker toolboxes. ""Attackers are efficient and always focused on what works most often, fastest and cheapest,"" said Christopher Budd, senior manager of threat research at Sophos, later adding ""attackers have focused on cheaper, easier attack angles."" That does not mean attacks could not materialize if the conditions were right, said Budd. ""Like we saw with SPECTRE — a solid mitigation response is a step in the right direction to prevent attacks. Intel and AMD have advised customers to adopt new mitigations, and today Microsoft released an update for AMD, as well,"" he said. Wikner and Razavi tested Linux patches for mitigations needed to address Retbleed and found the resources needed by patched computers ballooned. The AMD and Intel patches tested would add 14% and 39% overhead respectively.",research swiss univers eth zurich announc new addit spectr variant famili bug affect intel amd processor spectr made big splash medium first announc sinc sever spin vulner discov subsequ mitig famili work exploit specul calcul processor use boost speed preprocess multipl possibl path program might go rather wait program choos one focus eth zurich vulner discov doctor student johann wikner professor kaveh razavi focus instruct return program correct place memori dub vulner retble wikner razevi present paper proof concept retble usenix august retble potenti impact three sixyearold intel processor one yearold amd spectr receiv lot attent due massiv potenti impact attack never realli materi may complex public quick address ever becom stapl attack toolbox attack effici alway focus work often fastest cheapest said christoph budd senior manag threat research sopho later ad attack focus cheaper easier attack angl mean attack could materi condit right said budd like saw spectr — solid mitig respons step right direct prevent attack intel amd advis custom adopt new mitig today microsoft releas updat amd well said wikner razavi test linux patch mitig need address retble found resourc need patch comput balloon amd intel patch test would add overhead respect ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'flaw', 'intel']"
50,,Microsoft Pauses Once Touted Macro Security Change,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33619/Microsoft-Pauses-Once-Touted-Macro-Security-Change.html,11/07/2022,"In a move that has baffled much of the security community, Microsoft told Office 365 administrators Thursday that it would ""roll back"" a default block of VBA macros downloaded from the internet. ""Based on feedback, we’re rolling back this change from Current Channel. We appreciate the feedback we’ve received so far, and we’re working to make improvements in this experience. We’ll provide another update when we’re ready to release again to Current Channel. Thank you,"" the Redmond, Washington, firm messaged administrators. In a separate update to the original announcement, Microsoft said this was more of a pause than a delay. ""This is a temporary change, and we are fully committed to making the default change for all users.""  The feature announced in February received immediate praise in the security community. Confusion around the original announcement that the feature would be put on hold — particularly over if and what would eventually be released — received similarly quick concern. ""The general sentiment is: What good can possibly come from this,"" asked Sherrod DeGrippo, vice president of threat research and detection at Proofpoint. ""Everyone really celebrated, or was at least positive on the decision. The decision to now reverse course is, frankly, puzzling."" Microsoft introduced VBA macros in 1993, with the first macro virus, Concept, appearing soon after in 1995. Since then, one of the most common, consistent pieces of security advice has been for users or administrators to turn off macros. Yet, macros bring a lot of functionality and can be tough to abandon entirely. Microsoft's February announcement would have allowed administrators to split the difference; Office 365 would mark documents downloaded from the internet and, by default, show a warning page instead of running a macro in those documents. ""By any measure, email continues to be the prevailing vector leveraged by adversaries for initial access, leading to a wide variety of damaging cyberattacks. Disabling macros by default would have been majorly disruptive to adversaries, and a relatively minor disruption for IT professionals, who have the option to re-enable macros and accept the associated risks,"" said Brian Donohue, principal security specialist at Red Canary, via email. Microsoft did not directly answer questions submitted by SC Media about the decision to delay their February decision, but pointed to the updated announcement. The unfortunate thing, said DeGrippo, is that even just announcing that VBA macros would be turned off by default may have forced adversaries to change tactics. Even the sector of a change was having an effect. ""Emotet has used malicious macro documents for a billion years and just recently we have seen threat actors change their tactics and start using more containers, .LNK files, archive files, all that kind of stuff,"" she said. ""It's truly very easy to speculate that was a response to Microsoft's original decision. So not only was the earlier decision to disable macros by people celebrated, and seen as a positive, it actually really did impact behavior.""",move baffl much secur communiti microsoft told offic administr thursday would roll back default block vba macro download internet base feedback roll back chang current channel appreci feedback receiv far work make improv experi provid anoth updat readi releas current channel thank redmond washington firm messag administr separ updat origin announc microsoft said paus delay temporari chang fulli commit make default chang user featur announc februari receiv immedi prais secur communiti confus around origin announc featur would put hold — particular would eventu releas — receiv similar quick concern general sentiment good possibl come ask sherrod degrippo vice presid threat research detect proofpoint everyon realli celebr least posit decis decis revers cours frank puzzl microsoft introduc vba macro first macro virus concept appear soon sinc one common consist piec secur advic user administr turn macro yet macro bring lot function tough abandon entir microsoft s februari announc would allow administr split differ offic would mark document download internet default show warn page instead run macro document measur email continu prevail vector leverag adversari initi access lead wide varieti damag cyberattack disabl macro default would major disrupt adversari relat minor disrupt profession option reenabl macro accept associ risk said brian donohu princip secur specialist red canari via email microsoft direct answer question submit sc medium decis delay februari decis point updat announc unfortun thing said degrippo even announc vba macro would turn default may forc adversari chang tactic even sector chang effect emotet use malici macro document billion year recent seen threat actor chang tactic start use contain lnk file archiv file kind stuff said s truli easi specul respons microsoft s origin decis earlier decis disabl macro peopl celebr seen posit actual realli impact behavior ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'microsoft', 'flaw']"
51,,Flagstar Bank Breach Another Example Of Hacker Threat To Financial Sector,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33598/Flagstar-Bank-Breach-Another-Example-Of-Hacker-Threat-To-Financial-Sector.html,"/07/1,","Cybersecurity risks to financial institutions, such as banks and financial services, have grown in recent years despite the industry being heavily regulated to protect customers' data. Flagstar Bank, which operates 150 branches and is one of the largest mortgage servicers in the U.S., acknowledged on June 17 it suffered a data breach after hackers gained access to customers' personal information. The cyberattack on Flagstar Bank is not alone as financial institutions have become leading targets for cyber criminals. According to Check Point, there were 703 reported cyberattack attempts per week in 2021 within the industry, which was a 53% increase from 2020. ""Cyber incidents pose a threat to the stability of the global financial system,” the Financial Stability Board (FSB) warned in a report. “A major cyber incident, if not properly contained, could seriously disrupt financial systems, including critical financial infrastructure, leading to broader financial stability implications.” An accelerated digital transformation under COVID-19 pandemic and increasing geopolitical tensions are the two ongoing trends that exacerbate the risk. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, financial institutions have adopted new technologies to meet high demand of online financial services, which increases attack surfaces. Experts warned that banks’ automated solutions such as machine learning models pose more risk than the systems operators might have targeted in the past. “When you introduce machine learning into any kind of software infrastructure, it opens up new attack surfaces, new modalities for a system’s behavior might be corrupted,” Abhishek Gupta, the founder and principal researcher at Montreal AI Ethics Institute said in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. “There’s a sense of brittleness in that entire architecture, like a house of cards. You don’t know which of the cards that you pull out will lead to the whole thing collapsing entirely.” Meanwhile, the emergence of hybrid-work structure amplifies the complexity of IT systems. Companies rush into cloud applications, but fail to plan for the risk. For instance, cloud sprawl may occur if companies fail to monitor the number and type of cloud services they use. And employees’ with little IT training may misuse cloud applications, reusing the same password for work and personal accounts. While cyber criminals attack financial services for profit, state-backed hackers and patriotic hacktivists target the industry for political leverage with global tensions rising over Ukraine. “When you sort of marry what’s going on with Russia and Ukraine and China and other actors around the world geopolitically, you have to come back and think that one of their major weapons is cyber,“ Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President John Waldron said at a January event. Defenders should better understand attack vectors in recent cyber incidents so that they can preclude increasingly sophisticated attacks. Ransomware remains as the top cyber threat to financial institutions. The banking industry experienced a 1,318% increase in the number of ransomware attacks during the first half of 2021, compared with the same period a year ago, according to multinational cybersecurity company Trend Micro. Ransomware is a type of malware attack that locks and encrypts companies' data and files, and demands a payment to unlock and decrypt the data. Although most financial institutions have upgraded their data backup systems to defend against attacks, ransomware has evolved in response — attackers have begun to exfiltrate sensitive files before encrypting them, and threaten to leak the data if victims do not pay.  As a result of sophisticated methods, attackers have successfully targeted large financial services, such as the insurance company CNA Financial Corp.. CNA paid $40 million to regain control of its system after attackers applied malware called Phoenix Locker, a variant of ransomware invented by a Russia cybercrime group, in March, 2021, to the company's network, according to Bloomberg. Phishing attacks also pose significant risks to the industry in recent years. The number of phishing attacks reached a record high in the first quarter of 2022, exceeding one million, and the financial sector accounted for the highest amount, with 23.6% of all attacks, according to a recent report by Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). Phishing is a social engineering attack that steals users’ data by tricking them to click malicious links or visiting counterfeit websites. Leading financial firms, such as Charles Schwab Corp., Chase Bank, and RBC Royal Bank, are popular brands being spoofed in phishing URLs, according to Magni Sigurðsson, Senior Manager of Detection Technologies. While common phishing attacks require spoofed sign-in page development and hosting, the emergence of phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) makes attacks easier, allowing attackers to have access to full-scale phishing campaigns without having to set up everything themselves. Besides evolving phishing kits, phishing continues expanding under digital transformation. “We have seen an uptick in QR-based attacks as the relatively overlooked technology became more popular during the pandemic,” Sigurðsson wrote in a blog post. “These attacks are again effective at evading traditional email security tools, as the QR code itself is not a malicious asset and its link destination cannot be read by detection technologies optimized for text URLs and virus signatures.“ Cybersecurity experts urge collaborative cyber defense before the threat landscape continues to worsen. ""Unlike many sectors, most of the financial services community does not lack resources or the ability to implement technical solutions,"" cybersecurity experts Tim Maurer and Arthur Nelson wrote in a report published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). ""The main issue is a collective action problem: how best to organize the system's protection across governments, financial authorities, and industry and how to leverage these resources effectively and efficiently."" Some of the nation's largest banks, including JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley, are now working closely with the Treasury Department to practice how they would collaborate with each other to better defend cyberattacks, according to Bloomberg. While big players support each other to harden their defenses, small banks are struggling with the high cost of defending themselves against cyberattacks. In 2021, Kaseya, a U.S. information technology firm that supports many small banks' financial services, found itself experiencing a ransomware attack. Although the system was fixed later without a ransom payment, cybersecurity experts and community bank leaders worried about future attacks. Jeff Newgard, CEO of Bank of Idaho, a $700 million community bank, called on Congress to better support small banks in boosting cyber defense. ""We don't have information as it becomes available on the government side,"" Newgard said during an interview with MarketWatch. ""We feel like we're about a half step behind.""",cybersecur risk financi institut bank financi servic grown recent year despit industri heavili regul protect custom data flagstar bank oper branch one largest mortgag servic u acknowledg june suffer data breach hacker gain access custom person inform cyberattack flagstar bank alon financi institut becom lead target cyber crimin accord check point report cyberattack attempt per week within industri increas cyber incid pose threat stabil global financi system financi stabil board fsb warn report major cyber incid proper contain could serious disrupt financi system includ critic financi infrastructur lead broader financi stabil implic acceler digit transform covid pandem increas geopolit tension two ongo trend exacerb risk sinc covid pandem financi institut adopt new technolog meet high demand onlin financi servic increas attack surfac expert warn bank autom solut machin learn model pose risk system oper might target past introduc machin learn kind softwar infrastructur open new attack surfac new modal system behavior might corrupt abhishek gupta founder princip research montreal ai ethic institut said recent interview wall street journal sens brittl entir architectur like hous card know card pull lead whole thing collaps entir meanwhil emerg hybridwork structur amplifi complex system compani rush cloud applic fail plan risk instanc cloud sprawl may occur compani fail monitor number type cloud servic use employe littl train may misus cloud applic reus password work person account cyber crimin attack financi servic profit stateback hacker patriot hacktivist target industri polit leverag global tension rise ukrain sort marri go russia ukrain china actor around world geopolit come back think one major weapon cyber goldman sach group inc presid john waldron said januari event defend better understand attack vector recent cyber incid preclud increas sophist attack ransomwar remain top cyber threat financi institut bank industri experienc increas number ransomwar attack first half compar period year ago accord multin cybersecur compani trend micro ransomwar type malwar attack lock encrypt compani data file demand payment unlock decrypt data although financi institut upgrad data backup system defend attack ransomwar evolv respons — attack begun exfiltr sensit file encrypt threaten leak data victim pay result sophist method attack success target larg financi servic insur compani cna financi corp cna paid million regain control system attack appli malwar call phoenix locker variant ransomwar invent russia cybercrim group march compani s network accord bloomberg phish attack also pose signific risk industri recent year number phish attack reach record high first quarter exceed one million financi sector account highest amount attack accord recent report antiphish work group apwg phish social engin attack steal user data trick click malici link visit counterfeit websit lead financi firm charl schwab corp chase bank rbc royal bank popular brand spoof phish url accord magni sigurðsson senior manag detect technolog common phish attack requir spoof signin page develop host emerg phishingasaservic phaa make attack easier allow attack access fullscal phish campaign without set everyth besid evolv phish kit phish continu expand digit transform seen uptick qrbase attack relat overlook technolog becam popular pandem sigurðsson wrote blog post attack effect evad tradit email secur tool qr code malici asset link destin read detect technolog optim text url virus signatur cybersecur expert urg collabor cyber defens threat landscap continu worsen unlik mani sector financi servic communiti lack resourc abil implement technic solut cybersecur expert tim maurer arthur nelson wrote report publish intern monetari fund imf main issu collect action problem best organ system s protect across govern financi author industri leverag resourc effect effici nation s largest bank includ jp morgan chase co bank america corp morgan stanley work close treasuri depart practic would collabor better defend cyberattack accord bloomberg big player support harden defens small bank struggl high cost defend cyberattack kaseya u inform technolog firm support mani small bank financi servic found experienc ransomwar attack although system fix later without ransom payment cybersecur expert communiti bank leader worri futur attack jeff newgard ceo bank idaho million communiti bank call congress better support small bank boost cyber defens nt inform becom avail govern side newgard said interview marketwatch feel like re half step behind ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'bank', 'data loss']"
52,,"Questions Over Cyber Command Support, Operations Raised In Defense Authorization Bill",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33571/Questions-Over-Cyber-Command-Support-Operations-Raised-In-Defense-Authorization-Bill.html,23/06/2022,"The House Armed Services Committee gave its stamp of approval to a National Defense Authorization Act bill that will include a bevy of cyber-related reporting provisions as lawmakers seek to better understand how the military is adapting to new threats in cyberspace and implementing past mandates. On Wednesday the House committee passed an amended version of the FY 2023 NDAA that authorizes $131 billion in spending to bolster research and development for the Department of Defense, requires military leaders to further clarify how they define information operations and give Congress a 48-hour heads up before engaging in clandestine cyber operations and establishes a cyber threat information collaboration environment between DoD, the intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security. It would also require the head of U.S. Cyber Command to report on whether it is receiving sufficient support in cyberspace operations from each branch of military service. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., the outgoing chair of the Subcommittee on Cyber, Innovative Technologies and Information Systems who has played a major role standing up Cyber Command as a unified combatant command, urged his colleagues to continue supporting the agency as it engages in cybersecurity defense and intelligence collection in Ukraine and among allied nations. “We must continue to provide U.S. Cyber Command the resources it needs to keep us safe in cyberspace while ensuring there are robust oversight mechanisms in place,” said Langevin, who is retiring at the end of this term. “A cyber mission force is a tremendous asset in our arsenal, and in this mark we continue our efforts to ensure our cyber operators have the resources, the training and career trajectories that they need in order to succeed.” Langevin’s subcommittee mark dangles a stick to entice Pentagon leaders to hand over a joint lexicon of the different terms they use military information operations, including language that limits the department from accessing more than 75% of funds appropriated for the defense authorization bill until they do so. They also want a comprehensive review of the Cyber Excepted Service — a program that gives military leaders more flexibility to hire, recruit and retain critical cybersecurity personnel, including how easily civilian workers can advance It would also require DoD to hire a third-party contractor to examine costs around “underperforming” software and IT. The study would include a survey of members of the armed forces on how relying on this technology leads to lost working hours and impacts mission delivery, look at technical or policy challenges that prevent leaders at each branch from implementing reforms and recommending improvements. While the language in the bill doesn’t directly tie that underperformance issues to the need for IT modernization, out of date legacy IT systems and hardware have for years been a plague on DoD operations and efficiency. A Government Accountability Office report last year found that 10 out of 15 major IT projects reviewed at DoD had schedule delays ranging between one month to five years. Earlier this year, an open letter published by Michael Kanaan, director of operations for the Air Force/MIT Artificial Intelligence Accelerator, went viral for echoing the frustrations that many in the military feel about the IT environment they operate in daily. “Want innovation? You lost literally HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of employee hours last year because computers don’t work. Fix our computers,” Kanaan wrote, later adding “Ultimately, we can’t solve problems with the same tools that made them … and yet somehow fundamental IT funding is still an afterthought. … It’s not a money problem, it’s a priority problem.” As usual, the markup included a raft of cybersecurity-related provisions that were passed through a single En Bloc amendment. An amendment from Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., would require DHS and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to sketch out roles and responsibilities in cyberspace for each component agency and clarify how those roles would interact in the face of an incident response engagement within the federal government. Lawmakers are increasingly concerned about the ability of foreign adversaries to leverage facial recognition and other biometric technologies to collect genetic data on American military personnel, which could be used to identify spies and expose clandestine operations. A provision added by Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., requires a DoD briefing by March next year on any research efforts within DoD around emerging technologies that can potentially encrypt or scramble that genetic data. “The committee is aware of ongoing research that applies novel cryptography directly to DNA molecules, significantly enhancing the protection provided for genetic information, reducing the risk of incidental data breaches, supply chain vulnerabilities, and malicious cyber actors,” members noted in a written explanation of the amendment. Another amendment from Rep. Blake Moore, R-Utah, requests a similar report on how the National Security Agency is managing its Commercial Solutions for Classified Systems program, which allows the intelligence agency to more quickly tap into new or modern private sector commercial technologies. While Moore’s amendment praises NSA for the “success” of the program thus far, it also alluded to griping from some in industry about how responsive the program is to outside advice. The committee “is aware that some stakeholders from industry have made claims that the CSfC Architecture is not reviewed or updated in a timely manner, and may not incorporate feedback from the private sector,” the explanation for the amendment reads. “While the committee is aware of recent and upcoming updates of CSfC Capability and Annexes, [we believe] that greater clarity on the issue is required.”",hous arm servic committe gave stamp approv nation defens author act bill includ bevi cyberrel report provis lawmak seek better understand militari adapt new threat cyberspac implement past mandat wednesday hous committe pass amend version fy ndaa author billion spend bolster research develop depart defens requir militari leader clarifi defin inform oper give congress hour head engag clandestin cyber oper establish cyber threat inform collabor environ dod intellig communiti depart homeland secur would also requir head u cyber command report whether receiv suffici support cyberspac oper branch militari servic rep jim langevin dri outgo chair subcommitte cyber innov technolog inform system play major role stand cyber command unifi combat command urg colleagu continu support agenc engag cybersecur defens intellig collect ukrain among alli nation must continu provid u cyber command resourc need keep u safe cyberspac ensur robust oversight mechan place said langevin retir end term cyber mission forc tremend asset arsenal mark continu effort ensur cyber oper resourc train career trajectori need order succeed langevin subcommitte mark dangl stick entic pentagon leader hand joint lexicon differ term use militari inform oper includ languag limit depart access fund appropri defens author bill also want comprehens review cyber except servic — program give militari leader flexibl hire recruit retain critic cybersecur personnel includ easili civilian worker advanc would also requir dod hire thirdparti contractor examin cost around underperform softwar studi would includ survey member arm forc reli technolog lead lost work hour impact mission deliveri look technic polici challeng prevent leader branch implement reform recommend improv languag bill direct tie underperform issu need modern date legaci system hardwar year plagu dod oper effici govern account offic report last year found major project review dod schedul delay rang one month five year earlier year open letter publish michael kanaan director oper air forcemit artifici intellig acceler went viral echo frustrat mani militari feel environ oper daili want innov lost liter hundr thousand employe hour last year comput work fix comput kanaan wrote later ad ultim solv problem tool made … yet somehow fundament fund still afterthought … money problem prioriti problem usual markup includ raft cybersecurityrel provis pass singl en bloc amend amend rep bacon rneb would requir dhs cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc sketch role respons cyberspac compon agenc clarifi role would interact face incid respons engag within feder govern lawmak increas concern abil foreign adversari leverag facial recognit biometr technolog collect genet data american militari personnel could use identifi spi expos clandestin oper provis ad rep jason crow dcolo requir dod brief march next year research effort within dod around emerg technolog potenti encrypt scrambl genet data committe awar ongo research appli novel cryptographi direct dna molecul signific enhanc protect provid genet inform reduc risk incident data breach suppli chain vulner malici cyber actor member note written explan amend anoth amend rep blake moor rutah request similar report nation secur agenc manag commerci solut classifi system program allow intellig agenc quick tap new modern privat sector commerci technolog moor amend prais nsa success program thus far also allud gripe industri respons program outsid advic committe awar stakehold industri made claim csfc architectur review updat time manner may incorpor feedback privat sector explan amend read committe awar recent upcom updat csfc capabl annex believ greater clariti issu requir ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'cyberwar', 'military']"
53,,"Since 2004, The Average American Has Had At Least 7 Data Breaches",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33551/Since-2004-The-Average-American-Has-Had-At-Least-7-Data-Breaches.html,10/06/2022,"U.S. citizens face the greatest number of cyber threats as compared with people in other nations worldwide, according to a recent study by IT security company Surfshark. After reviewing nearly two decades of data regarding cyber incidents, Surkshark found that the average American had been affected by at least seven data breaches since 2004. U.S. citizens have faced an estimated 2.3 billion account compromises, while Russia comes second with 2.2 billion accounts of cyberattacks, followed by China, Germany and France. “On a global scale, 191 accounts are breached per 100 people on average,"" said Agneska Sablovskaja, data researcher at Surfshark. “However, in the U.S., this number goes up to 694 per 100 people. Statistically speaking, a single American person has had around seven instances in which they were victims of data breaches.” The scale of breached American accounts is “so massive that it makes up around 15% of all breached users globally,” according to a release from Surfshark. “Statistically, every U.S. internet user has lost 27 data points on average to online breaches, most of them emails, passwords and usernames.” Ironically, many of these breaches go basic security block-and-tackling. Case in point: More than two-thirds of American accounts are leaked with the basic password access, putting 72% of breached users in danger of account takeover that might lead to identity theft, extortion or other cybercrimes. The study is based on the data from reviewing 27,000 leaked databases. U.S. citizens have faced more breached accounts, per capita, than any other country since early 2020.  A combined sum of 8.7 billion American last names, IPs, first names, passwords, usernames, and other data has been sold or leaked online since 2004. “This means that there is a high likelihood that a certain username was grouped with other personal data, giving criminals direct access to various victims’ profiles, emails, photos or documents,” according to Surfshark, which found that for every 10 leaked American accounts, there are seven breached passwords found in the datasets. However, there may be a light at the end of the tunnel: In terms of breach rate, U.S. statistics (694 breaches per 100 people) look more positive than Russia’s attack rate. Russian citizens face 1,489 breaches per every hundred people, “meaning that there is virtually no chance to not be subject to some sort of cybercrime if you live in Russia.” Similarly, while China stands third in terms of total breached users, its rate is 69 per 100 due to the enormous size of the population. Germany and France take fourth and fifth place, respectively, showing similar breach rates to the U.S., according to Surfshark. There is little doubt that breaches overall are on the rise. In the first quarter of 2022, 304 global accounts were being breached every minute. And, in the second quarter of 2022, breach rates are 6.7% higher. However, on a positive note, the trend in the United States runs contrary to this worldwide trend: The U.S. breach rate is 33% lower when comparing the second quarter of this year to the last, falling from 18 to 12 breached accounts per minute.",u citizen face greatest number cyber threat compar peopl nation worldwid accord recent studi secur compani surfshark review near two decad data regard cyber incid surkshark found averag american affect least seven data breach sinc u citizen face estim billion account compromis russia come second billion account cyberattack follow china germani franc global scale account breach per peopl averag said agneska sablovskaja data research surfshark howev u number go per peopl statist speak singl american person around seven instanc victim data breach scale breach american account massiv make around breach user global accord releas surfshark statist everi u internet user lost data point averag onlin breach email password usernam iron mani breach go basic secur blockandtackl case point twothird american account leak basic password access put breach user danger account takeov might lead ident theft extort cybercrim studi base data review leak databas u citizen face breach account per caput countri sinc earli combin sum billion american last name ip first name password usernam data sold leak onlin sinc mean high likelihood certain usernam group person data give crimin direct access various victim profil email photo document accord surfshark found everi leak american account seven breach password found dataset howev may light end tunnel term breach rate u statist breach per peopl look posit russia attack rate russian citizen face breach per everi hundr peopl mean virtual chanc subject sort cybercrim live russia similar china stand third term total breach user rate per due enorm size popul germani franc take fourth fifth place respect show similar breach rate u accord surfshark littl doubt breach overal rise first quarter global account breach everi minut second quarter breach rate higher howev posit note trend unit state run contrari worldwid trend u breach rate lower compar second quarter year last fall breach account per minut ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
54,,Data For 2 Million Patients Stolen In Largest Healthcare Breach So Far In 2022,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33535/Data-For-2-Million-Patients-Stolen-In-Largest-Healthcare-Breach-So-Far-In-2022.html,"/06/8,","Two million patients from nearly 60 healthcare providers were recently informed that their data was stolen after the hack of a third-party vendor, Shields Health Care Group. Shields Health provides MRI, PET/CT, and outpatient surgical services for covered entities. The breach tally makes it the largest healthcare data breach reported so far this year. The “suspicious activity” was discovered on the Shields network on March 28, which “may have involved data compromise.” Shields took steps to contain the incident, and an investigation was launched with support from third-party forensic specialists. Law enforcement was also notified. The investigation found that a hacker gained access to certain Shields systems for three weeks between March 7 and March 21. During the dwell time, the attacker stole “certain data” from the network. According to the notice, “although Shields identified and investigated a security alert on or around March 18, data theft was not confirmed at that time.” Shields has since determined the stolen data varied by patient and could include names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, contact details, provider names, diagnoses, billing information, insurance details, medical record numbers, patient IDs, and other medical or treatment information. The investigation into the incident is ongoing. But the hack forced Shields to rebuild certain systems. The vendor is currently working to review and enhance its existing security measures. Heidell Pittoni Murphy & Bach (HPMD), the medical malpractice litigation counsel for New York Presbyterian Hospital, recently began notifying 114,979 patients that their data was acquired during an apparent extortion incident in December 2021. Suspicious activity was discovered within the network environment on Christmas 2021, prompting the IT support team to respond and partner with a third-party forensic specialist to analyze the activity. Notably, HPMD “immediately engaged a law firm specializing in cybersecurity and data privacy to investigate further.” The preliminary assessment revealed an attacker  “gained control over certain firm information for a period of time until HPMD was able to negotiate its return.” The data could include names, dates of birth, SSNs, and medical treatment information, which was “part of a tranche of data accessed and briefly held” by the hacker. HPMD has since confirmed the security of the network environment and ensured “no further unauthorized activity has continued.” The firm has also reviewed and revised its security policies and procedures. At least six more healthcare providers and their patients have been added to the ongoing Eye Care Leaders breach tally, which has already claimed well over 200,000 patients. The cloud-based electronic medical record vendor is currently defending itself against a provider-led lawsuit claiming ECL experienced multiple ransomware attacks and outages earlier this year. The latest filings with the Department of Health and Human Services include 1,337 Burman & Zuckerbrod Ophthalmology patients, 2,646 Fishman Vision patients, 13,461 Associated Ophthalmologists of Kansas City patients, 48,587 Finkelstein Eye Associates patients, 38,000 Moyes Eye Center patients, and 50,631 patients from AU Health. All of the breach notices mirror earlier notifications from providers also impacted by the Dec. 4, 2021, ransomware attack deployed against ECL. An attacker gained access to the myCare Integrity platform and its data, then deleted databases and system configuration files.  “A lack of available forensic evidence prevented Eye Care Leaders from ruling out the possibility that some protected health information and personally identifiable information may have been exposed to the bad actor,” according to one notice. The compromised data could include patient names, dates of birth, SSNs, diagnostic details, and health insurance information. Fishman Vision and Moyes Eye Center have since terminated their vendor relationships with Eye Care Leaders, while Finkelstein Eye is “working with Eye Care Leaders to evaluate additional measures and safeguards to protect against this type of event in the future.” Meanwhile, AU Health “assessing alternative ophthalmology EMR platforms.” The data of 28,332 patients of Homestead Hospice & Palliative Care in Georgia was potentially compromised during a yearlong hack of multiple employee email accounts between April 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022. Upon discovery, the accounts were secured. The subsequent investigation determined “some patient information” was involved in the incident, which may include names, contact information, SSNs, dates of birth, medical record numbers, health insurance details, and other care information related to treatment at Homestead. Of note, during its investigation into the email hack, Homestead discovered some former workforce members failed to return their work laptops, which contained patient information. Homestead has since contacted those employees to “confirm that patient information contained on the laptops, if any, has not been misused or disclosed.” Homestead has since reinforced its employee education around patient privacy and implemented additional security measures for its email system.",two million patient near healthcar provid recent inform data stolen hack thirdparti vendor shield health care group shield health provid mri petct outpati surgic servic cover entiti breach talli make largest healthcar data breach report far year suspici activ discov shield network march may involv data compromis shield took step contain incid investig launch support thirdparti forens specialist law enforc also notifi investig found hacker gain access certain shield system three week march march dwell time attack stole certain data network accord notic although shield identifi investig secur alert around march data theft confirm time shield sinc determin stolen data vari patient could includ name social secur number date birth contact detail provid name diagnosi bill inform insur detail medic record number patient id medic treatment inform investig incid ongo hack forc shield rebuild certain system vendor current work review enhanc exist secur measur heidel pittoni murphi bach hpmd medic malpractic litig counsel new york presbyterian hospit recent began notifi patient data acquir appar extort incid decemb suspici activ discov within network environ christma prompt support team respond partner thirdparti forens specialist analyz activ notabl hpmd immedi engag law firm special cybersecur data privaci investig further preliminari assess reveal attack gain control certain firm inform period time hpmd abl negoti return data could includ name date birth ssns medic treatment inform part tranch data access briefli held hacker hpmd sinc confirm secur network environ ensur unauthor activ continu firm also review revis secur polici procedur least six healthcar provid patient ad ongo eye care leader breach talli alreadi claim well patient cloudbas electron medic record vendor current defend providerl lawsuit claim ecl experienc multipl ransomwar attack outag earlier year latest file depart health human servic includ burman zuckerbrod ophthalmolog patient fishman vision patient associ ophthalmologist kansa citi patient finkelstein eye associ patient moy eye center patient patient au health breach notic mirror earlier notif provid also impact dec ransomwar attack deploy ecl attack gain access mycar integr platform data delet databas system configur file lack avail forens evid prevent eye care leader rule possibl protect health inform person identifi inform may expos bad actor accord one notic compromis data could includ patient name date birth ssns diagnost detail health insur inform fishman vision moy eye center sinc termin vendor relationship eye care leader finkelstein eye work eye care leader evalu addit measur safeguard protect type event futur meanwhil au health assess altern ophthalmolog emr platform data patient homestead hospic palliat care georgia potenti compromis yearlong hack multipl employe email account april march upon discoveri account secur subsequ investig determin patient inform involv incid may includ name contact inform ssns date birth medic record number health insur detail care inform relat treatment homestead note investig email hack homestead discov former workforc member fail return work laptop contain patient inform homestead sinc contact employe confirm patient inform contain laptop misus disclos homestead sinc reinforc employe educ around patient privaci implement addit secur measur email system ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
55,,FDA Urges Patch Of Illumina Devices,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33522/FDA-Urges-Patch-Of-Illumina-Devices.html,"/06/3,","Providers should “immediately download and install” a patch for certain Illumina devices, which the manufacturer issued last month. The software update fixes critical flaws in a range of devices that could put patient safety at risk, according to an FDA letter to the healthcare sector. The Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency released an alert on June 2, detailing the vulnerabilities found in certain Illumina In Vitro Diagnostic devices and Researcher Use Only (ROU) instruments. The platforms rely on Local Run Manager (LRM) software, which contain a number of high-severity vulnerabilities. Illumina issued the software update to its healthcare clients last month. As the healthcare sector often struggles with patch management and prioritization, the FDA and CISA warnings should move the vulnerable Illumina products to the top of the patching queue. The LRM used in these products contain five vulnerabilities, of which, 10 are ranked critical in severity. The 10.0 base score is a rare occurrence, let alone three 10.0 scores for one element. For reference, the prolific Log4j also received a 10-ranking. The 10.0 vulnerabilities in the LRM include ‘execution with unnecessary privileges,’ meaning the LRM uses elevated privileges. CISA warns that an unauthenticated threat actors could exploit the flaw to “upload and execute code remotely at the operating system level.” A successful attack would enable the actor to “change settings, configurations, software, or access sensitive data on the affected product,” or “access APIs not intended for general use and interact through the network.” One other 10.0 vulnerability is caused by an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, which would allow a hacker to upload outside of the intended directory structure.  Further, the LRM doesn’t restrict the file types able to be uploaded to the impacted products, which means an attacker could upload any file type, “ including executable code that allows for a remote code exploit. The FDA warned that a successful exploit of these flaws could impact “patient test results in the instruments intended for clinical diagnosis, including causing the instruments to provide no results or incorrect results, altered results, or a potential data breach.” The two remaining vulnerabilities, one ranked 9.1 and the other ranked 7.4 in severity, are caused by the LRM failing to use authentication or authorization by default and one LRM version failing to implement TLS encryption. An exploit of these flaws could let an attacker inject, replay, modify, and/or intercept sensitive data, or launch a man-in-the-middle attack to access sensitive data in transit, including credentials. “Illumina has developed a software patch to protect against the exploitation of this vulnerability and is working to provide a permanent software fix for current and future instruments,” according to the FDA. The patch should be immediately applied to impacted products, including “each stand-alone instance of the off-instrument LRM for RUO mode on the Dx instruments.”  Healthcare providers should review the urgent safety notification or product quality notification sent by Illumina on May 3, or contact the manufacturer if they use the impacted products and did not receive notification. CISA also recommends healthcare provider organizations take defensive action to prevent possible exploit, including minimizing network exposure for all control system devices, isolating remote devices and systems behind a firewall and separate from the business network, and employ a secure method when remote access is required. Fortunately, Illumina and the FDA have not received any reports that indicate the vulnerability has yet been exploited in the wild. Both parties are coordinating with CISA to prevent and communicate any adverse events tied to the vulnerability. The FDA will notify providers if any new information comes to light.",provid immedi download instal patch certain illumina devic manufactur issu last month softwar updat fix critic flaw rang devic could put patient safeti risk accord fda letter healthcar sector cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc releas alert june detail vulner found certain illumina vitro diagnost devic research use rou instrument platform reli local run manag lrm softwar contain number highsever vulner illumina issu softwar updat healthcar client last month healthcar sector often struggl patch manag priorit fda cisa warn move vulner illumina product top patch queue lrm use product contain five vulner rank critic sever base score rare occurr let alon three score one element refer prolif logj also receiv rank vulner lrm includ ‘ execut unnecessari privileg mean lrm us elev privileg cisa warn unauthent threat actor could exploit flaw upload execut code remot oper system level success attack would enabl actor chang set configur softwar access sensit data affect product access api intend general use interact network one vulner caus improp limit pathnam restrict directori would allow hacker upload outsid intend directori structur lrm restrict file type abl upload impact product mean attack could upload file type includ execut code allow remot code exploit fda warn success exploit flaw could impact patient test result instrument intend clinic diagnosi includ caus instrument provid result incorrect result alter result potenti data breach two remain vulner one rank rank sever caus lrm fail use authent author default one lrm version fail implement tl encrypt exploit flaw could let attack inject replay modifi andor intercept sensit data launch maninthemiddl attack access sensit data transit includ credenti illumina develop softwar patch protect exploit vulner work provid perman softwar fix current futur instrument accord fda patch immedi appli impact product includ standalon instanc offinstru lrm ruo mode dx instrument healthcar provid review urgent safeti notif product qualiti notif sent illumina may contact manufactur use impact product receiv notif cisa also recommend healthcar provid organ take defens action prevent possibl exploit includ minim network exposur control system devic isol remot devic system behind firewal separ busi network employ secur method remot access requir fortun illumina fda receiv report indic vulner yet exploit wild parti coordin cisa prevent communic advers event tie vulner fda notifi provid new inform come light ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'flaw', 'patch']"
56,,Industrial IoT Ransomware Attacks Control Systems Directly,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33512/Industrial-IoT-Ransomware-Attacks-Control-Systems-Directly.html,"/06/1,","Researchers at Forescout's Verede Labs released a proof of concept that exploits a bug to penetrate industrial systems more deeply embedded within industrial processes than ever seen before. One of the recent projects at Verede Labs has been ""Project Memoria,"" an audit for vulnerabilities in popular TCP/IP stacks  — including many commonly used in Internet of Things devices. The ""R4IIoT"" ransomware concept they debuted Wednesday weaponizes that research, exploiting a denial of service bug in Nucleus the group discovered in 2021 to disable industrial processes. Other ransomware has attacked industrial systems in the past. Ransomware in Colonial Pipeline attack reportedly disabled billing systems on the IT networks, resulting in the company shutting down OT systems until it could properly charge for service. The Snake/Ekans ransomware disrupted the Windows systems that gave commands to PLCs and other industrial equipment connected directly to the industrial processes. But R4IIoT works differently, harming the PLCs and similar systems directly. That is a big deal, because that level of IIoT system can often be remote. For all the difficulty of remediating an encryption-based attack on a system in a central office, an attacker that shuts down a geographically distributed grid of devices one at a time until demands are met presents staffing problems that have not been seen before. ""When you're talking about OT, it could be a ship in the ocean. It could be things that are really geographically dispersed, like manufacturing plant that on another side of the planet or a substation that is remotely in some desert, and that you may not have a team there ready to do any sort of forensics or to understand what's going on. And honestly, when you see the OT side going down, it's not often it's not a matter of rebooting everything,"" said Daniel Dos Santos, head of security research at Verede Labs. Verede proposes that this kind of IIoT attack could become the next mechanism in play for ransomware gangs. Ransomware operators have tried several layered forms of extortion in the past, including adding threats of leaks and DDoS attacks as a way of incentivizing enterprises with good backups to pay. IIoT shutdowns could create an entirely new layer of extortion organizations focused on encryption may not be prepared for. ""One thing that we have noticed is that people still think very much of ransomware as encrypting data, which is not just the case anymore,"" said Dos Sanos ""The case is really that ransomware is about getting ransom is about getting a payout of out of an attack.""",research forescout s vered lab releas proof concept exploit bug penetr industri system deepli embed within industri process ever seen one recent project vered lab project memoria audit vulner popular tcpip stack — includ mani common use internet thing devic riiot ransomwar concept debut wednesday weapon research exploit denial servic bug nucleus group discov disabl industri process ransomwar attack industri system past ransomwar coloni pipelin attack report disabl bill system network result compani shut ot system could proper charg servic snakeekan ransomwar disrupt window system gave command plcs industri equip connect direct industri process riiot work differ harm plcs similar system direct big deal level iiot system often remot difficulti remedi encryptionbas attack system central offic attack shut geograph distribut grid devic one time demand met present staf problem seen re talk ot could ship ocean could thing realli geograph dispers like manufactur plant anoth side planet substat remot desert may team readi sort forens understand s go honest see ot side go s often s matter reboot everyth said daniel do santo head secur research vered lab vered propos kind iiot attack could becom next mechan play ransomwar gang ransomwar oper tri sever layer form extort past includ ad threat leak ddos attack way incentiv enterpris good backup pay iiot shutdown could creat entir new layer extort organ focus encrypt may prepar one thing notic peopl still think much ransomwar encrypt data case anymor said do sano case realli ransomwar get ransom get payout attack ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'malware', 'scada', 'cryptography']"
57,,Russia Nixes US Charges Against REvil As Cooperation Fizzles,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33504/Russia-Nixes-US-Charges-Against-REvil-As-Cooperation-Fizzles.html,31/05/2022,"Blaming the United States for a lack of cooperation, Russian will not charge the defendants in the REvil case with any attacks on Americans or American businesses, according to Russian media reports last week. Whatever progress the United States had made under the Biden administration in encouraging Moscow to address its harboring of cybercriminals appears to be at a standstill. ""America doesn't care about Russian hackers"" read the headline of the Russian newspaper Kommersant. Russia arrested eight members of the REvil group in January based on tips from U.S. intelligence. According to Kommersant, the U.S. has not continued to engage with Russia. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the matter. The REvil defendants, linked to attacks on major corporations and supply chain nodes, will now only be charged with credit card fraud against two Mexican citizens living in America. Curbing ransomware and cybercrime requires several levels of action, according to the multistakeholder Ransomware Task Force, of which network defense is only one aspect. A single enterprise blocking a single attack protects the organization but does not impact the longterm viability of crime — criminals will move on to the next target, and will live to develop new attacks and try again. Hampering the criminal ecosystem, the task force suggested, will require collective action across nations, particularly breaking up crime in nations reluctant to prosecute it. ""[Russian cooperation] is essential because most of these actors are operating from in Russia’s jurisdiction and our leadership is not yet willing to exercise extraterritorial action in order to gain custody of these actors,"" said Megan Stifel, co-chair of the Task Force and chief strategy officer of the Institute for Security and Technology. The REvil arrests came after months of the United States and international pressure for Russia to handle the cybercriminal gangs inside the country. REvil ransomware was used in attacks on meat producer JBS, the supply chain attack on Kaseya, and other big-ticket targets. While the group briefly shut down before the arrests, potentially due to law enforcement risks, REvil has recently reemerged. Russian cooperation on ransomware has always been tenuous, with many onlookers immediately assuming Russia was at best trying to provide the minimum effort to avoid sanctions, and at worst trying to make a case to allow it to attack Ukraine without international interference that would jeopardize the ransomware crackdown. ""I have had low expectations regarding Russian cooperation on cybercrime ever since the Crimean invasion in 2014.  From the Russian perspective, it has not been in their interest to clamp down on this kind of criminal activity; it served too many valuable purposes,"" said Michael Daniel, president and chief executive of the Cyber Threat Alliance and former White House Cybersecurity Coordinator. Allowing external attacks prevents groups from attacking internally, establishes technical might, needles western nations, incentivizes capitulation to Russia, and provides cover for attacks like NotPetya that are designed to look like ransomware. The war in Ukraine may have strained relationships between Russia and the West to a point where cooperation is impossible, said Stifel, who was optimistic about the growing relationship until then. ""At this point, though, relations have deteriorated to the point that Russia likely does not see any benefit to maintaining whatever minimal cooperation was occurring. Until the war ends, I don’t see the situation changing, nor do I see any real levers left to pull,"" Daniel said.",blame unit state lack cooper russian charg defend revil case attack american american busi accord russian medium report last week whatev progress unit state made biden administr encourag moscow address harbor cybercrimin appear standstil america nt care russian hacker read headlin russian newspap kommers russia arrest eight member revil group januari base tip u intellig accord kommers u continu engag russia depart justic declin comment matter revil defend link attack major corpor suppli chain node charg credit card fraud two mexican citizen live america curb ransomwar cybercrim requir sever level action accord multistakehold ransomwar task forc network defens one aspect singl enterpris block singl attack protect organ impact longterm viabil crime — crimin move next target live develop new attack tri hamper crimin ecosystem task forc suggest requir collect action across nation particular break crime nation reluct prosecut russian cooper essenti actor oper russia jurisdict leadership yet will exercis extraterritori action order gain custodi actor said megan stifel cochair task forc chief strategi offic institut secur technolog revil arrest came month unit state intern pressur russia handl cybercrimin gang insid countri revil ransomwar use attack meat produc jbs suppli chain attack kaseya bigticket target group briefli shut arrest potenti due law enforc risk revil recent reemerg russian cooper ransomwar alway tenuous mani onlook immedi assum russia best tri provid minimum effort avoid sanction worst tri make case allow attack ukrain without intern interfer would jeopard ransomwar crackdown low expect regard russian cooper cybercrim ever sinc crimean invas russian perspect interest clamp kind crimin activ serv mani valuabl purpos said michael daniel presid chief execut cyber threat allianc former white hous cybersecur coordin allow extern attack prevent group attack intern establish technic might needl western nation incentiv capitul russia provid cover attack like notpetya design look like ransomwar war ukrain may strain relationship russia west point cooper imposs said stifel optimist grow relationship point though relat deterior point russia like see benefit maintain whatev minim cooper occur war end see situat chang see real lever left pull daniel said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'malware', 'usa', 'russia', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'cyberwar', 'cryptography']"
58,,Web App Attacks On The Rise In Healthcare,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33490/Web-App-Attacks-On-The-Rise-In-Healthcare.html,25/05/2022,"Basic web application attacks, miscellaneous errors and system intrusions were behind 76% of healthcare data breaches in 2021, according to the annual Verizon Data Breach Investigations report. These leading threats were the same in last year’s report, but web apps now dominate the breach trends. It’s the third year in a row where external threat actors outpaced insiders as the leading cause of healthcare security incidents and breaches following multiple, consecutive years where insiders were the leading breach cause, particularly misbehaving employees. Although external threats now dominate, it doesn’t mean that healthcare has conquered its insider challenges. The researchers stressed that “errors are a significant problem” for healthcare. “Make no mistake,” researchers wrote, “your employees are still causing breaches, but they are more than two and a half times more likely to make an error than to maliciously misuse their access.”  The DBIR team analyzed 23,896 security incidents, including 5,212 confirmed data breaches across all sectors. Among the analyzed incidents, healthcare accounted for 849 reported security incidents, 571 of which had confirmed data disclosures. Of these incidents, 36 were tied to small entities and 14 to large organizations. The entity size for the remaining 799 incident was unknown. For breaches, 14 were tied to smaller providers, 10 to large entities, and the size of the remaining entities is unknown. For healthcare, the rise in web app attacks is driving the rate of external threats. It’s a notable stat, as the rise in these attacks did not begin until 2019 and it has “clearly become a serious problem for everyone, not just this industry.”  “Healthcare has increasingly become a target of run-of-the-mill hacking attacks and the more impactful ransomware campaigns (both from the System Intrusion pattern, which came in third),” according to the report. “With the increase in ransomware, comes the associated increase of the discovery method of actor disclosure.” Further, the report showed 61% of data breaches were caused by external threat actors, compared with 39% of internal actors. The majority of data breaches were driven by financial motives (95%), with espionage trailing far behind with 4% of breach incidents. Attacks driven by convenience or grudges each accounted for 1% of the total breaches across the sector. The report showed 58% of these incidents led to the compromise of personal data, with medical data compromised in 46% of breaches and 29% led to credential theft. It’s the second year in a row that personal data was compromised more than health information. The report also examined privilege misuse across all sectors, which found healthcare is the most common industry represented in this pattern. These incidents are overwhelmingly caused by insiders, where the primary goal is to use legitimate access to steal data. The report confirms most privilege misuse incidents lead to successful data breaches. In these situations, the actor “looks to capitalize on their access” by finding customer, employee, and partner data. Given the prevalence of privilege misuse in healthcare, the researchers note that it’s no surprise medical data is taken in 22% of privilege misuse incidents. “Healthcare has had an ongoing problem with internal actors accessing their data without a valid reason for a long time. … While it is no longer in the top tier of the patterns in healthcare, it should not be discounted as a solved problem,” according to the report. Data mishandling is also tied to privilege misuse and is driven by “convenience,” or when an employee performs an unsafe action to get around a security control meant to prevent the exposure of data. These controls make it harder to complete their work. As such, “it’s important to pair these controls with education to at least let people know the ‘why’ behind the process.” Organizations that repeatedly suffer these types of events should consider “offering a less laborious process that remains secure,” the researchers noted. The report also revealed that medical data is compromised in 43% of lost or stolen assets and 18% of all misconfiguration incidents. The report confirms the recent Senate testimony from I am the Cavalry Founder Josh Corman that stressed the sector’s “dependence on connected technology was growing faster than our ability to secure it, in areas affecting public safety, human life and national security,” particularly as there are a host of free resources and entities focused on healthcare security challenges.",basic web applic attack miscellan error system intrus behind healthcar data breach accord annual verizon data breach investig report lead threat last year report web app domin breach trend third year row extern threat actor outpac insid lead caus healthcar secur incid breach follow multipl consecut year insid lead breach caus particular misbehav employe although extern threat domin mean healthcar conquer insid challeng research stress error signific problem healthcar make mistak research wrote employe still caus breach two half time like make error malici misus access dbir team analyz secur incid includ confirm data breach across sector among analyz incid healthcar account report secur incid confirm data disclosur incid tie small entiti larg organ entiti size remain incid unknown breach tie smaller provid larg entiti size remain entiti unknown healthcar rise web app attack drive rate extern threat notabl stat rise attack begin clear becom serious problem everyon industri healthcar increas becom target runofthemil hack attack impact ransomwar campaign system intrus pattern came third accord report increas ransomwar come associ increas discoveri method actor disclosur report show data breach caus extern threat actor compar intern actor major data breach driven financi motif espionag trail far behind breach incid attack driven conveni grudg account total breach across sector report show incid led compromis person data medic data compromis breach led credenti theft second year row person data compromis health inform report also examin privileg misus across sector found healthcar common industri repres pattern incid overwhelm caus insid primari goal use legitim access steal data report confirm privileg misus incid lead success data breach situat actor look capit access find custom employe partner data given preval privileg misus healthcar research note surpris medic data taken privileg misus incid healthcar ongo problem intern actor access data without valid reason long time … longer top tier pattern healthcar discount solv problem accord report data mishandl also tie privileg misus driven conveni employe perform unsaf action get around secur control meant prevent exposur data control make harder complet work import pair control educ least let peopl know ‘ behind process organ repeat suffer type event consid offer le labori process remain secur research note report also reveal medic data compromis lost stolen asset misconfigur incid report confirm recent senat testimoni cavalri founder josh corman stress sector depend connect technolog grow faster abil secur area affect public safeti human life nation secur particular host free resourc entiti focus healthcar secur challeng ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'data loss']"

It follows Killnet announcing it was at war with Annonymous two months earlier. The level of fascination is high. The risk of spillover affecting your organization is low. You could bill this as a fight between high-profile citizen cyber warfare groups backing opposite sides of a kinetic conflict. But in practice, in the context of huge beasts of war causing geopolitical strife and the risk of spillover, ""Brainy Smurf and Handy Smurf are getting into a fight,"" said Allan Liska, an analyst with Recorded Future. The risk of an escalating conflict between the two groups affecting the outside world is minimal, said Liska, as neither group has had much disruptive impact during the conflict affecting the outside world by attacking it directly. The declaration of conflict made it as far as the mainstream media. The two groups are no strangers to headlines. The Anonymous brand name was built through high-profile protests, though it has declined in the hierarchy of threats for most organizations since its heyday. Throughout the war in Ukraine, Anonymous took credit for nuisance attacks on Russian targets, including hack and leak operations involving its largest bank and an energy customs broker, reprogramming Russian media to show clips of the conflict, and DDoS operations against the country's space agency. Killnet briefly disrupted the Italian Senate servers and an automotive club with its own DDoS and failed at a high-profile attack on the Eurovision music contest. Soon after declaring war, Anonymous successfully DDoSed the Killnet website. ""Compare what Anonymous and what Killnet are doing to what Conti has done in Costa Rica.

The vulnerabilities, which Synopsys' CyRC research lab discovered in November, are tracked as CVE-2022-30617 and CVE-20220-30618. Both vulnerabilities involve too much user data being exposed in the backend. The exposed data includes password reset tokens, which could be leveraged to steal accounts. ""A malicious user could abuse this vulnerability to reset passwords and thereby gain access to those accounts,"" said David Johansson, principal security consultant at Synopsys Software Integrity Group. ""You could create content on behalf of users, maybe discredit them or publish fake news or possibly read content that hasn't been published yet from other voters."" Strapi has three levels of privilege: ""Writer,"" ""Editor"" and ""Super User."" But both vulnerabilities offer ways for lower-privileged users to see data from higher-level users who interact with them. In the first vulnerability, the author of a file has accesses to details of the JSON response for a user who updates the file, meaning a disgruntled Writer could peer into the account data of an Editor or Super User who edited their post. In the second, one user gained access to JSON responses to another user making use of the API if the second user is related to content types the first has access to. Strapi version 3 users are safe from both vulnerabilities after updating to version 3.6.10 or later. Version 4 users are safe from 30617 by using stable releases of Strapi and 30618 by updating to 4.1.10 or later. Johansson emphasized the API vulnerabilities are extremely common.

61,,New Framework Aims To Secure Digital Health Apps Not Covered By HIPAA,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33414/New-Framework-Aims-To-Secure-Digital-Health-Apps-Not-Covered-By-HIPAA.html,"/05/6,","A new framework developed and released by several healthcare stakeholder groups takes aim at securing digital health technologies and mobile health apps, the vast majority of which fall outside of The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulation. Developed in partnership between The American College of Physicians, the American Telemedicine Association, and the Organization for the Review of Care and Health Applications, the U.S. framework is meant to support both healthcare professionals and consumers.  The open Digital Health Assessment Framework is accessible for anyone to use and meant to support the adoption of high-quality digital health technologies, while supporting healthcare leaders and patients to make more informed decisions about the best digital health tools for their unique needs. “Digital health technologies can offer safe, effective, and engaging access to personalized health and support, and provide more convenient care, improve patient and provider satisfaction, and achieve better clinical outcomes,” said Ann Mond Johnson, ATA CEO, in a statement. “Our goal is to provide confidence that the health and wellness tools reviewed in this framework meet quality, privacy and clinical assurance criteria in the U.S,” she added. More than 86 million U.S. consumers leverage a health or fitness app, which are lauded for supporting patients with maintaining their health outside of the provider office. However, any health app not recommended for use by a healthcare provider falls outside the purview of HIPAA. The trouble is that the data overwhelmingly shows that app developers engage in some less-than-transparent practices that put patient privacy at risk. In April 2019, a study published in JAMA found the majority of health apps share data with third parties but just a handful disclosed the practice to consumers in the privacy policies, based on a cross-sectional assessment of the top ranked apps for depression and smoking cessation in the U.S. and Australia. While most of the examined apps were upfront about the primary use of their data, only 16 of the apps shared the secondary uses for data sharing. That same study showed that nearly half of the apps transmitted data to a third party but lacked a privacy policy, with five apps failing to disclose the practice in policy text. And in more than 80% of cases, the data sharing occurred for marketing purposes to Google and Facebook. Another study published in BMJ in March 2019 found the majority of the top 24 health medicine management Android apps in North America shared user data without clearly telling consumers about the practice.  Again in 2021, a Knight Ink and Approov study confirmed the 30 most popular mHealth apps are highly vulnerable to API cyberattacks, which could lead to the possible exploit of health data. The Federal Trade Commission has previously announced it would use its health breach rule to enforce flagrant consumer privacy violations, but just a handful of app developers have been found in violation. The new framework from ACP, ATA, and ORCHA means to support the healthcare sector with better understanding the safety of products. As noted in its release: “In a field of 365,000 products, where the vast majority fall outside of existing regulations, such as the medical device regulations, federal laws and government guidance, there has been no clear way to determine if a product is safe to use.”  The lack of guidance is hindering the adoption of digital health, including condition management, clinical risk assessment, and decision support. The new framework addresses these privacy and security components, as well as clinical assurance, patient safety, and usability. The health groups noted the insights were crafted to support guidance and regulations currently in use for digital health tech in the U.S. The groups hope the guide can support the further adoption of digital health technologies. For ACP President Ryan D. Mire, MD, the guide is an important step to identifying and developing digital health tools that provide value while maintaining patient safety. The guidance was crafted from the clinical expertise of ACP and ATA members, in tandem with ORCHA’s experience with app assessments. Along with the new framework, ACP announced a pilot test of digital health tools that were reviewed against the new framework. Mire added that the hope is the pilot can help determine the most useful elements for providers to recommend high-value digital health tools to patients and identify the potential barriers to wider digital health adoption.",new framework develop releas sever healthcar stakehold group take aim secur digit health technolog mobil health app vast major fall outsid health insur portabl account act regul develop partnership american colleg physician american telemedicin associ organ review care health applic u framework meant support healthcar profession consum open digit health assess framework access anyon use meant support adopt highqual digit health technolog support healthcar leader patient make inform decis best digit health tool uniqu need digit health technolog offer safe effect engag access person health support provid conveni care improv patient provid satisfact achiev better clinic outcom said ann mond johnson ata ceo statement goal provid confid health well tool review framework meet qualiti privaci clinic assur criterion u ad million u consum leverag health fit app laud support patient maintain health outsid provid offic howev health app recommend use healthcar provid fall outsid purview hipaa troubl data overwhelm show app develop engag lessthantranspar practic put patient privaci risk april studi publish jama found major health app share data third parti hand disclos practic consum privaci polici base crosssect assess top rank app depress smoke cessat u australia examin app upfront primari use data app share secondari us data share studi show near half app transmit data third parti lack privaci polici five app fail disclos practic polici text case data share occur market purpos googl facebook anoth studi publish bmj march found major top health medicin manag android app north america share user data without clear tell consum practic knight ink approov studi confirm popular mhealth app high vulner api cyberattack could lead possibl exploit health data feder trade commiss previous announc would use health breach rule enforc flagrant consum privaci violat hand app develop found violat new framework acp ata orcha mean support healthcar sector better understand safeti product note releas field product vast major fall outsid exist regul medic devic regul feder law govern guidanc clear way determin product safe use lack guidanc hinder adopt digit health includ condit manag clinic risk assess decis support new framework address privaci secur compon well clinic assur patient safeti usabl health group note insight craft support guidanc regul current use digit health tech u group hope guid support adopt digit health technolog acp presid ryan d mire md guid import step identifi develop digit health tool provid valu maintain patient safeti guidanc craft clinic expertis acp ata member tandem orcha experi app assess along new framework acp announc pilot test digit health tool review new framework mire ad hope pilot help determin use element provid recommend highvalu digit health tool patient identifi potenti barrier wider digit health adopt ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy']"
62,,Avast Patches Decades Old Vulnerabilities In Antivirus Product,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33410/Avast-Patches-Decades-Old-Vulnerabilities-In-Antivirus-Product.html,"/05/5,","Earlier this year, Avast quietly patched two similar vulnerabilities in its antivirus product that went undiscovered for a decade. The vulnerabilities, both discovered by SentinelOne's SentinelLabs, were introduced into Avast in January 2012, and were copied into AVG when the companies merged in 2016. ""Our vulnerability research team has been doing a lot of work just going through different drivers and products that people use on a regular basis, and essentially just checking the security engineering checking the standard of how things are built. And obviously looking for vulnerabilities,"" said Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, principle threat researcher at SentinalLabs. The vulnerabilities, which lay in wait for the time it took the Marvel Cinematic Universe to release 22 movies, resided in the Avast anti-rootkit driver. By tricking the driver to expect a string of a different size than the driver is about to send it, attackers can overwrite data, ultimately resulting in breaking out of a sandbox, disabling security and escalating privilege. ""I'd love to say that it's a super complex vulnerability, but the truth of it is that it isn't,"" said Guerrero-Saade. There is no evidence hackers have used the vulnerability in the past. AVG and Avast customers with the 22.1 update released in January have been patched. Guerrero-Saade said that the most important takeaway from the research for enterprises is not that the software is vulnerable — which he noted was still true, especially in a world where computers used to work from home may be family computers protected by Avast or AVG. Instead, he said, it is that software built on legacy code often harbors extremely old vulnerabilities. ""The real issue here is misaligned incentives, how most companies don't really have much of an incentive to go back and fix their codebases and look at old code, unless enterprises demand they check if it rises to the standard of security engineering that they would expect in the 2020s,"" he said.

Armis, the security firm that discovered the problem, had previously discovered similar problems in APC power supplies, and worries this problem will not be limited to power and networking. ""I can say approximately 50- or 60 percent of the devices we've checked using NanoSSL are vulnerable to the same type of vulnerabilities because it's very easy to make these mistakes,"" said Barak Hadad, head of research at Armis. Mocana's NanoSSL library is widely used in internet of things (IoT) devices. Armis has not identified any problems in the library itself. Instead, the problems occur when data returned from the library is not properly validated and errors are not handled properly. Hadad said that the requirements for implementation are accurately described in the manuals for NanoSSL. ""But we all know developers. No one reads the manuals,"" said Hadad. Armis worked with Mocana to make NanoSSL harder to misuse, both within the code and through vendor alerts. But legacy products may already have problems. Armis is calling the switch vulnerabilities ""TLStorm2.0."" There are five CVEs in total, two in Aruba and three in Avaya. The TLStorm2.0 bugs affected models from the Aruba product series 2530, 2540, 2920, 2930F, 2930M, 5400R, and 3810 and Avaya series ERS3500, ERS3600, ERS4900 and ERS5900. The issues identified could be severe. Two of the issues identified in Avaya switches lead to remote code execution and one of the Aruba bugs allows attackers to break out of captive portals and hop from VLAN to VLAN. Most of the vulnerabilities have been patched, according to Armis, and the ones that have not been have mitigations available. Users can check with Avaya here for and Aruba here. TLStorm2.0 follows TLStorm, vulnerabilities in APC power backups. Taking advantage of misuse in the power backups, Armis was able to change how much power was flowing through a power supply and the waveform, and demonstrated they were able to set equipment ablaze through malicious surges of power. Hadad said that NanoSSL implementation bugs likely extend far beyond network switches and universal power supplies. ""If vendors are using Mocana NanoSSL and want us to check if they're vulnerable, they can communicate with us and we will be happy to help,"" he said. ""Also, we have a technical white paper that shows exactly how this misuse looks like in the code.""",sever model network switch across two major manufactur suffer similar implement problem ssl librari armi secur firm discov problem previous discov similar problem apc power suppli worri problem limit power network say approxim percent devic ve check use nanossl vulner type vulner s easi make mistak said barak hadad head research armi mocana s nanossl librari wide use internet thing iot devic armi identifi problem librari instead problem occur data return librari proper valid error handl proper hadad said requir implement accur describ manual nanossl know develop one read manual said hadad armi work mocana make nanossl harder misus within code vendor alert legaci product may alreadi problem armi call switch vulner tlstorm five cf total two aruba three avaya tlstorm bug affect model aruba product seri f m r avaya seri er er er er issu identifi could sever two issu identifi avaya switch lead remot code execut one aruba bug allow attack break captiv portal hop vlan vlan vulner patch accord armi one mitig avail user check avaya aruba tlstorm follow tlstorm vulner apc power backup take advantag misus power backup armi abl chang much power flow power suppli waveform demonstr abl set equip ablaz malici surg power hadad said nanossl implement bug like extend far beyond network switch univers power suppli vendor use mocana nanossl want u check re vulner communic u happi help said also technic white paper show exact misus look like code ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'flaw', 'cryptography']"
64,,Microsoft Details Rampant Russian Invasion Cyber Warfare,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33384/Microsoft-Details-Rampant-Russian-Invasion-Cyber-Warfare.html,28/04/2022,"Microsoft released a timeline of nearly 250 cyber operations from six separate Russian-aligned threat groups since the waning days before Russia began its physical assault. Microsoft also detailed cyber operations dating back almost a year in preparation for the physical attack. ""Threat groups with known or suspected ties to the GRU have continuously developed and used destructive wiper malware or similarly destructive tools on targeted Ukrainian networks at a pace of two to three incidents a week since the eve of invasion,"" Microsoft wrote in its report. ""From Feb. 23 to April 8, we saw evidence of nearly 40 discrete destructive attacks that permanently destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations in Ukraine."" Microsoft said that Russian groups known to target Ukraine began a dramatic uptick in those activities in March of 2021, about a year before the late February 2022 physical invasion of the country. The early breaches were ""aimed at securing persistent access for strategic and battlefield intelligence collection or to facilitate future destructive attacks,"" said Microsoft. In early 2021, as Russia began to assemble troops on the Ukrainian border, Russia began phishing campaigns against Ukrainian interests rallying support for the country. By the middle of the year, Russian groups began laying breaching IT vendors servicing Ukraine and NATO to leverage for supply chain attacks. Throughout 2021, 93% of Russian attempts to breach Microsoft accounts were targeted at NATO member states. In 2021, Gamaredon targeted Ukrainian military leaders and humanitarian workers. APT 28 targeted defense-related organizations in Ukraine and a then unknown group that would later launch the Whispergate wiper against Ukraine just before the invasion, established access in Ukrainian energy and IT firms that were later targets of attacks. Those groups  alongside Turla, Energetic Bear and all would establish persistent footholds in Ukranian ""defense, defense industrial base, foreign policy, national and local administration, law enforcement, and humanitarian organizations."" Nobellium, the group known for the Solarwinds breaches in late 2020, phished NATO-state targets after beginning the year targeting Ukrainian interests,drumming up support for the country as Russia amassed troups at the boarder. MIcrosoft noted several instances when kinetic military actions were timed with cyber support. A missile attack on a Kyiv TV tower came a day after the compromise of one Kyiv media company and the same day as widescale destructive attacks on Kyiv media groups. The takeover of the largest nuclear power station in Ukraine came the same time as lateral movement through the networks of energy companies. Russia breached the government networks of Vinnytsia two days before the physically taking the Vinnytsia airport, and a destructive implant was placed on Dnipro government systems the same day as the first rocket strikes against the city. Those were just examples from the first two weeks of the war. The report lists several of the known attacks against Ukraine, including Industroyer2 and the various wiper malware attacks. In the report, Microsoft reiterates a warning given by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the start of the invasion: ""As the conflict persists and countries provide more military assistance to Ukraine or take more punitive measures against the Russian government, Russian nation state threat actors may be tasked to expand their destructive actions in retaliation against targets outside of Ukraine in retaliation.""",microsoft releas timelin near cyber oper six separ russianalign threat group sinc wane day russia began physic assault microsoft also detail cyber oper date back almost year prepar physic attack threat group known suspect tie gru continu develop use destruct wiper malwar similar destruct tool target ukrainian network pace two three incid week sinc eve invas microsoft wrote report feb april saw evid near discret destruct attack perman destroy file hundr system across dozen organ ukrain microsoft said russian group known target ukrain began dramat uptick activ march year late februari physic invas countri earli breach aim secur persist access strateg battlefield intellig collect facilit futur destruct attack said microsoft earli russia began assembl troop ukrainian border russia began phish campaign ukrainian interest ralli support countri middl year russian group began lay breach vendor servic ukrain nato leverag suppli chain attack throughout russian attempt breach microsoft account target nato member state gamaredon target ukrainian militari leader humanitarian worker apt target defenserel organ ukrain unknown group would later launch whisperg wiper ukrain invas establish access ukrainian energi firm later target attack group alongsid turla energet bear would establish persist foothold ukranian defens defens industri base foreign polici nation local administr law enforc humanitarian organ nobellium group known solarwind breach late phish natost target begin year target ukrainian interest drum support countri russia amass troup boarder microsoft note sever instanc kinet militari action time cyber support missil attack kyiv tv tower came day compromis one kyiv medium compani day widescal destruct attack kyiv medium group takeov largest nuclear power station ukrain came time later movement network energi compani russia breach govern network vinnytsia two day physic take vinnytsia airport destruct implant place dnipro govern system day first rocket strike citi exampl first two week war report list sever known attack ukrain includ industroy various wiper malwar attack report microsoft reiter warn given cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc start invas conflict persist countri provid militari assist ukrain take punit measur russian govern russian nation state threat actor may task expand destruct action retali target outsid ukrain retali ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'microsoft', 'russia', 'cyberwar', 'military']"
65,,Breach Update Shows 2.6M Individuals Affected By Smile Brands Data Theft,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33375/Breach-Update-Shows-2.6M-Individuals-Affected-By-Smile-Brands-Data-Theft.html,27/04/2022,"In an update to its initial September 2021 breach notice, Smile Brands has assessed that the ransomware attack and subsequent data theft impacted approximately 2.6 million individuals. Smile Brands is a dental support services vendor. Smile Brands reported the incident to the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights on June 24, 2021, as impacting 199,683 individuals. The latest filing with the Maine Attorney General’s office shows the updated breach tally as 2,592,494 individuals, including employees. As previously disclosed, a ransomware attack deployed on April 24, 2021, led to the access of certain systems containing personal data. Access was promptly terminated and law enforcement was notified. The investigation that followed found that the attacker exfiltrated certain data ahead of the deployment of ransomware. The data included names, contact details, Social Security numbers, financial information, government-issued IDs, and/or personal health information. At the time, Smile Brands notified the impacted individuals that the investigation was ongoing. The vendor has since bolstered its monitoring capabilities and security safeguards. According to SC Media’s tally, the Smile Brand incident was the fourth-largest healthcare data breach of 2021. ARCare in Arkansas recently began notifying 345,353 patients that their data was compromised during a “malware infection” that impacted its systems and temporarily disrupted some services. Despite the description, ransomware is not mentioned in the notice. The investigation into the incident determined a hacker accessed and possibly acquired some patient data “during a period of unauthorized access” to the computer systems for more than a month between Jan. 18 and Feb. 24. The notice does not explain when the attack was first discovered. ARCare conducted a review of the impacted data, which concluded on April 4. The potentially stolen data varied by patient and could include both medical and personal information, such as names, SSNs, driver's licenses or state IDs, dates of birth, financial account details, treatments, prescriptions, diagnoses or conditions, and health insurance data.  A team of third-party specialists has since helped ARcare enhance its systems security. ARcare is currently reviewing its existing policies and procedures, in addition to implementing internal training protocols to prevent a recurrence. The data of 510,574 Adaptive Health Integrations patients was possibly accessed during a systems hack in October 2021. The lengthy gap in notification was caused by an “extensive investigation and an internal review” that did not conclude until Feb. 23, 2022. Under The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, covered entities are required to notify patients of breaches to protected health information within 60 days of discovery, not after the conclusion of an investigation. The notice does not detail the specific cause of the incident, just that it discovered the attacker accessed a limited amount of data stored on the AHI systems on Oct. 17, 2021. Upon discovery, the response team disable the actor’s access to contain the threat and launched an investigation with assistance from an outside cybersecurity firm. The investigation determined the accessed data included patient names, dates of birth, SSNs, and contact information. Not all AHI patients were affected by the incident. Exhibiting a similar attack timeframe and lag in notification as AHI, Illinois Gastroenterology Group recently began notifying an undisclosed number of patients that their data was potentially accessed or stolen during a systems hack in October 2021. On Oct. 22, IGG discovered unusual network activity, which prompted an investigation with support from third-party cybersecurity specialists. About one month later, the team confirmed that the attacker gained access to certain IGG systems containing patient data, which may have been accessed or exfiltrated by the actor. A review of the data concluded on March 22, which found the data impacted during the incident included names, SSNs, dates of birth, contact details, driver’s licenses, passports, financial account details, payment cards, employer-assigned identification numbers, medical data, and biometric data. IGG has since enhanced its network security policies and procedures, while accelerating an ongoing enhancement of its managed security operations center. On April 15, HealthPlex notified 76,262 patients that their data was compromised after a successful phishing attempt against an employee in November 2021. HealthPlex is a dental plan provider based in Eagan, Minnesota. The notice describes the incident as an employee falling victim to a phishing attack, which provided the hacker with access to their email account on Nov. 24, 2021. It’s unclear when the attack was launched, but the account was secured upon discovery and an investigation was launched to determine the scope of the incident. A comprehensive review of the data contained in the account determined that the potentially accessed data included patient names, contact details, SSNs, dates of birther, member ID numbers, plan affiliation, dates of service, provider names, billed/paid amounts, prescriptions, banking details, credit cards, and a host of other sensitive information. The lack of timely notice is likely tied to the extensive investigation. Healthplex has since bolstered the security of its environment. Contra Costa County, California recently began notifying certain individuals that the hack of several employee email accounts led to the access and potential theft of personal and medical data.  Upon discovering unusual activity, the impacted email accounts were secured. The subsequent investigation found that an actor accessed the accounts on various occasions for over a month between June 24, 2021, and Aug. 12, 2021. The notice does not detail when the incident was discovered, just that the investigation concluded on March 11, 2022. The investigating team couldn’t determine whether the emails or attachments were accessed or downloaded by the attackers, nor were they able to rule out the possibility. The accounts contained a range of data tied to county employees and individuals who communicated with the county’s employment and human services department.  The data could include SSNs, driver’s licenses or state-issued IDs, financial account numbers, passport numbers, and medical data and/or health insurance information.",updat initi septemb breach notic smile brand assess ransomwar attack subsequ data theft impact approxim million individu smile brand dental support servic vendor smile brand report incid depart health human servic offic civil right june impact individu latest file main attorney general offic show updat breach talli individu includ employe previous disclos ransomwar attack deploy april led access certain system contain person data access prompt termin law enforc notifi investig follow found attack exfiltr certain data ahead deploy ransomwar data includ name contact detail social secur number financi inform governmentissu id andor person health inform time smile brand notifi impact individu investig ongo vendor sinc bolster monitor capabl secur safeguard accord sc medium talli smile brand incid fourthlargest healthcar data breach arcar arkansa recent began notifi patient data compromis malwar infect impact system temporarili disrupt servic despit descript ransomwar mention notic investig incid determin hacker access possibl acquir patient data period unauthor access comput system month jan feb notic explain attack first discov arcar conduct review impact data conclud april potenti stolen data vari patient could includ medic person inform name ssns driver s licens state id date birth financi account detail treatment prescript diagnosi condit health insur data team thirdparti specialist sinc help arcar enhanc system secur arcar current review exist polici procedur addit implement intern train protocol prevent recurr data adapt health integr patient possibl access system hack octob lengthi gap notif caus extens investig intern review conclud feb health insur portabl account act cover entiti requir notifi patient breach protect health inform within day discoveri conclus investig notic detail specif caus incid discov attack access limit amount data store ahi system oct upon discoveri respons team disabl actor access contain threat launch investig assist outsid cybersecur firm investig determin access data includ patient name date birth ssns contact inform ahi patient affect incid exhibit similar attack timefram lag notif ahi illinoi gastroenterolog group recent began notifi undisclos number patient data potenti access stolen system hack octob oct igg discov unusu network activ prompt investig support thirdparti cybersecur specialist one month later team confirm attack gain access certain igg system contain patient data may access exfiltr actor review data conclud march found data impact incid includ name ssns date birth contact detail driver licens passport financi account detail payment card employerassign identif number medic data biometr data igg sinc enhanc network secur polici procedur acceler ongo enhanc manag secur oper center april healthplex notifi patient data compromis success phish attempt employe novemb healthplex dental plan provid base eagan minnesota notic describ incid employe fall victim phish attack provid hacker access email account nov unclear attack launch account secur upon discoveri investig launch determin scope incid comprehens review data contain account determin potenti access data includ patient name contact detail ssns date birther member id number plan affili date servic provid name billedpaid amount prescript bank detail credit card host sensit inform lack time notic like tie extens investig healthplex sinc bolster secur environ contra costa counti california recent began notifi certain individu hack sever employe email account led access potenti theft person medic data upon discov unusu activ impact email account secur subsequ investig found actor access account various occas month june aug notic detail incid discov investig conclud march investig team determin whether email attach access download attack abl rule possibl account contain rang data tie counti employe individu communic counti employ human servic depart data could includ ssns driver licens stateissu id financi account number passport number medic data andor health insur inform ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
66,,Bluetooth Vulnerability In Smart COVID Test Patched,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33360/Bluetooth-Vulnerability-In-Smart-COVID-Test-Patched.html,22/04/2022,"Cue Health announced Friday a patch for unsecured Bluetooth communications in its smart Cue Health Home COVID-19 Test that allowed the user or another attacker to change the results of the test. It is the second manufacturer of smart COVID-19 tests to patch this type of vulnerability after Ellume in December. Both the Cue and Ellume vulnerabilities were discovered by Ken Gannon, a researcher with WithSecure (formerly F-Secure Business). ""As I was closing up the previous findings, I got an ad for another COVID test,"" Gannon told SC Media. ""And I was like, 'Wow, that looks expensive. I want to buy it, see what I can do with it.' And here we are a few months later again, going through the same thing."" The Cue is a more expensive test because it is a more accurate nucleic acid amplification test than cheaper antigen tests. ""I thought it'd be a good test to see if this more accurate test had the same issues as the last one. It did,""  said Gannon. While the test is itself accurate, an attacker could flip a single bit in the Bluetooth communications between the test and a mobile device or computer to change the result. The incorrect result would be uploaded to the Cue servers before a final result was certified by the company. Cue and Ellume are both used in situations where accurate, certified, third-party results are critical. Both are permitted options for COVID testing for travel. The manufacturers remotely monitor test-takers through online video,  allowing users to obtain third-party certified results without needing to go to a clinic. Following Gannon's disclosure, Cue instituted checks to prevent fraudulent results. ""The reliability and security of our technology is of the utmost importance to our company and we appreciate the WithSecure team’s collaboration. Thanks to WithSecure’s help, we confirmed that highly skilled individuals with cybersecurity expertise could change a test result, and we swiftly issued a software update to fix this issue to detect the falsification of COVID-19 test results in the Cue Health App,” said Vimal Subramanian, vice president of information security and privacy at Cue Health, in a statement. Gannon cautioned that, despite his finding similar problems in two COVID tests, the devices themselves are broadly accurate — and as more researchers do more research, the tests will become even more trustworthy. Over focusing on the issues he found and insisting on in-person testing, he said, would eliminate some of the freedoms these devices allow. ""I just want to make sure that everyone does understand that there are people like me out there that are trying to make sure that these devices can stay within that level of confidence that people can use,"" he said.",cue health announc friday patch unsecur bluetooth communic smart cue health home covid test allow user anoth attack chang result test second manufactur smart covid test patch type vulner ellum decemb cue ellum vulner discov ken gannon research withsecur former fsecur busi close previous find got ad anoth covid test gannon told sc medium like wow look expens want buy see month later go thing cue expens test accur nucleic acid amplif test cheaper antigen test thought d good test see accur test issu last one said gannon test accur attack could flip singl bit bluetooth communic test mobil devic comput chang result incorrect result would upload cue server final result certifi compani cue ellum use situat accur certifi thirdparti result critic permit option covid test travel manufactur remot monitor testtak onlin video allow user obtain thirdparti certifi result without need go clinic follow gannon s disclosur cue institut check prevent fraudul result reliabl secur technolog utmost import compani appreci withsecur team collabor thank withsecur help confirm high skill individu cybersecur expertis could chang test result swift issu softwar updat fix issu detect falsif covid test result cue health app said vimal subramanian vice presid inform secur privaci cue health statement gannon caution despit find similar problem two covid test devic broad accur — research research test becom even trustworthi focus issu found insist inperson test said would elimin freedom devic allow want make sure everyon understand peopl like tri make sure devic stay within level confid peopl use said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'virus', 'wireless', 'flaw']"

Part 2 deals with prescriptive advice for mitigating account takeover risk. As most researchers and financial executives can attest, virtually all types of fraud have dramatically risen over the past two years. However, attackers taking over legitimate financial accounts have become even more of a favorite with cybercriminals than most fraud schemes. Many major recent research reports have pointed out that account takeover (ATO), a form of identity theft where bad actors access legitimate bank accounts, change the account information and passwords, and hijack a real customer’s account, has skyrocketed since last year. According to Javelin Research’s annual ""Identity Fraud Study: The Virtual Battleground"" report, account takeover increased by 90% to an estimated $11.4 billion in 2021 when compared with 2020 — representing roughly one-quarter of all identity fraud losses last year. Like many types of financial fraud, cyber thieves are betting on the fact that if they attempt to seize a large number of legitimate accounts, eventually they will get a payoff. “Account takeovers are a numbers game,” said Gal Diskin, co-founder and chief technology officer for Authomize. “The more accounts that an organization has, the bigger their risk that some of them will be compromised.” Account takeovers often piggyback off of previous attacks, making these crimes a way for hackers to make the most out of stolen information. Diskin pointed out that account takeovers most commonly happen when a password is “taken from another data leak and reused for different accounts. But there are a variety of risky scenarios that can lead to compromise.” In its most recent quarterly financial crime report, Feedzai, a cyber-risk management provider to the financial industry, cited the growing threat from account takeover, which topped the list of top fraud scams last year, rising from fourth place in 2020. CyberEdge Group, also released research just last week that corroborates the same findings about ATO. In its 2022 ""Cyberthreat Defense Report,"" which surveyed 1,200 IT security personnel worldwide, account takeover was one of the two most pervasive and expanding threats (along with malware). The CyberEdge research also predicts this type of pernicious fraud will continue to rise this year and beyond. “ATO attacks are poised to overtake malware as the number one concern,” according to the CyberEdge Group research, adding that concerns for ATO and credential stuffing saw the biggest increase of any risk for IT security respondents. “Malware is still perceived as the most important threat, but account takeover and credential abuse attacks moved up from fourth place last year to number two this year... [and] ATO will take over the top spot in the next year or two,” the CyberEdge report predicted. Aside from being efficient, relatively easy and popular among cyber criminals, account takeover can be a jumping-off point to even more fraud incidents. “Account takeover fraud poses a variety of risks to financial institutions because fraudsters will often weaponize a compromised bank account to perpetrate more fraud,” according to Mike Bosserman, chief revenue officer at MANTL, which helps banks and credit unions develop digital account opening platforms.   For example, criminals will use the stolen bank account to fund a new bank account they open online for criminal activities, Bosserman said. “Failing to catch a fraudster during the account opening process can lead to significant financial losses down the road for financial institutions,"" he said.",note part account takeov cite numer time financi industri research fastestgrow pervas andor concern fraud type part deal prescript advic mitig account takeov risk research financi execut attest virtual type fraud dramat risen past two year howev attack take legitim financi account becom even favorit cybercrimin fraud scheme mani major recent research report point account takeov ato form ident theft bad actor access legitim bank account chang account inform password hijack real custom account skyrocket sinc last year accord javelin research annual ident fraud studi virtual battleground report account takeov increas estim billion compar — repres rough onequart ident fraud loss last year like mani type financi fraud cyber thief bet fact attempt seiz larg number legitim account eventu get payoff account takeov number game said gal diskin cofound chief technolog offic authom account organ bigger risk compromis account takeov often piggyback previous attack make crime way hacker make stolen inform diskin point account takeov common happen password taken anoth data leak reus differ account varieti riski scenario lead compromis recent quarter financi crime report feedzai cyberrisk manag provid financi industri cite grow threat account takeov top list top fraud scam last year rise fourth place cyberedg group also releas research last week corrobor find ato cyberthreat defens report survey secur personnel worldwid account takeov one two pervas expand threat along malwar cyberedg research also predict type pernici fraud continu rise year beyond ato attack pois overtak malwar number one concern accord cyberedg group research ad concern ato credenti stuf saw biggest increas risk secur respond malwar still perceiv import threat account takeov credenti abus attack move fourth place last year number two year ato take top spot next year two cyberedg report predict asid effici relat easi popular among cyber crimin account takeov jumpingoff point even fraud incid account takeov fraud pose varieti risk financi institut fraudster often weapon compromis bank account perpetr fraud accord mike bosserman chief revenu offic mantl help bank credit union develop digit account open platform exampl crimin use stolen bank account fund new bank account open onlin crimin activ bosserman said fail catch fraudster account open process lead signific financi loss road financi institut said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'password', 'identity theft']"
69,,How Identity And Access Management Fits Into Zero Trust,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33313/How-Identity-And-Access-Management-Fits-Into-Zero-Trust.html,11/04/2022,"In a network that has no perimeter, knowing exactly who and what is on the network and why they are there is essential to maintaining organizational security. That's why a strong identity and access management (IAM) policy is fundamental to successfully deploying zero-trust architecture. Indeed, zero trust means continually verifying authorized users as they move about the network and granting each user the lowest possible privileges when accessing sensitive areas, documents, or files. And while single sign-on and other authentication techniques can help automate aspects of both employee and customer identity and access management, even authorized users must verify themselves when moving from one segment of the network to another. While the information security community has widely embraced zero trust as a philosophy, no comprehensive understanding exists for transitioning from zero trust as a concept to a reality. Nor are there universal standards for implementation. Yet, what remains undisputed is the critical role of IAM plays. Often it's step one in an effective zero trust roadmap. To measure how well organizations are doing with zero trust implementation, CRA Business Intelligence conducted a survey of 300 IT and security decision makers in January and February 2022. ""Overall, the risk has decreased once we focused on assigning individuals the least amount of permissions possible to do their jobs,"" said one survey respondent whose organization had adopted the zero-trust model. But many organizations are slow to move to a zero-trust model, despite the vast increase in the number of staffers working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing irrelevance of the perimeter-security model. Only about 35% of respondents to the survey said they were very familiar with zero-trust concepts, and about the same number said they had implemented it. Click here to review the agenda and register for the 13th annual Identiverse conference in Denver, Colorado, June 21-24 Company managers may not understand the importance of zero trust, and consequently may not allocate the resources to migrate to the new model. A quarter of the survey respondents who had not implemented the zero-trust model said management lack of support was a major constraint, and another quarter cited a lack of funding. ""Despite zero-trust mandates within the federal agencies, commercial organizations are less familiar with zero trust concepts,"" said Matt Alderman, executive vice president of CyberRisk Alliance. ""These zero-trust research findings show that management support and budgets are the largest obstacles to implementing zero trust, which means adoption will be slow."" At the beginning of the pandemic, thousands of organizations suddenly faced the fact that most or all employees would be working remotely. No longer could these organizations rely on the perimeter security model, in which network access depends more on where you are — i.e., on-premises vs. off-premises — rather than who you are. Instead, many of these organizations had to switch to an identity-driven security model, which lets a properly authenticated and verified user or device access the network from anywhere. But if you eliminate the perimeter entirely, then you need to tightly monitor and often sharply restrict what each user and device can do on the network — which leads to the zero-trust model. Simply put, a zero-trust security model assumes a threat can just as easily come from inside the network as from outside it. The perimeter no longer matters. Instead of asking a user to authenticate themselves only at the perimeter, the zero-threat model also asks users to authenticate themselves when moving from one part of the network to another, or when accessing documents or files that require higher levels of security clearance. No user or device is ever fully trusted. Paradoxically, the zero-trust model offers more flexibility to staffers. The model is based on who users and devices are rather than where they are. A user logging into the company network from home using their own PC is treated no differently from a user logging into the network from a company-provisioned machine on company property. Each device and user must state and prove identity, and that identity will determine the level of access granted. That's where the identity and access management (IAM) policy comes in. You cannot have a functional zero-trust architecture without a robust IAM policy. The network administrator — or, more likely, the Active Directory domain controller — needs to know exactly who or what each device granted access to the network is, and exactly what levels of access that person or machine needs to do the job. Why is that important? Because weak or underenforced IAMs aren't good enough. Verizon Data Breach Incident Reports indicate that most breaches involve stolen or brute-forced user credentials. A March 2022 report by XM Cyber, as cited by SC Magazine, found that ""73% of the top attack techniques involve mismanaged or stolen credentials."" Once they're in the network, the intruders move laterally through it, penetrating new areas and new levels of access, evading SIEMs and other detection mechanisms by appearing to be legitimate users. This is exactly the kind of movement that strong IAM policies and zero-trust architectures are designed to prevent. The attackers don't even have to be outsiders. In April 2022, Block (formerly Square) notified 8.2 million customers of its CashApp subsidiary that their personal information, including full names, account numbers and portfolio information, had been stolen by a former employee who still had access to CashApp's systems. A properly deployed IAM policy might have prevented this breach. Yet implementing a proper IAM policy isn't easy. As the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) noted in a 2020 white paper about zero-trust architecture, network administrators must first identify all the ""identities,"" both human and machine, that need access to the network as part of their jobs. Every single user, which in the computing sense can be a person, a program or a machine, needs to be named and catalogued with that user's specific access privileges, from the newest intern to the long-standing CEO. As NIST states in its white paper, ""often, these accounts are granted too high a level of trust, let alone zero trust."" This can lead to awkward decisions that IT managers may not be empowered to make, because NIST also states that ""access levels should be trimmed back to the least privileged necessary for them to perform their tasks."" In other words, an IT staffer may have to tell a C-suite exec that he can no longer access huge areas of the company network — and convince him that doing so is for the greater good of the organization. Greater access can always be granted if necessary. ""There are still occasions where a user isn't granted enough permissions,"" stated one respondent to the CyberRisk Alliance survey whose organization had fully moved to the zero-trust model. ""But it's usually better to grant fewer than required instead of too many because permissions can be changed as needed unless resources have already been breached."" And indeed, the survey found that among the components of zero-trust architecture, implementing such least-privilege principles in IAM was rated of low importance by the average respondent. Implementing multi-factor authentication, a concept that might be easier to explain and justify to management, was granted the highest importance. ""Management support and budget limitations are hindering zero trust adoption, at least in the near term, "" said CyberRisk Alliance's report on the zero-trust survey. ""Deployment has been slowed by an ongoing struggle to fully comprehend the elements that embody zero trust and how to put all the pieces together. "" Yet among the survey respondents, the CyberRisk Alliance survey identified 70 ""champion"" organizations that had successfully implemented the zero-trust model. These organizations tended to be a bit larger than the average survey respondents, and to be concentrated in manufacturing, health care and technology. Many had regulatory obligations or concerns about complex supply chains that may have spurred the move to zero trust, but 66% also said they wanted to reduce the risks posed by remote workers. Significantly, these champion organizations not only had the technical know-how to implement a zero-trust architecture, but also upper management support for and understanding of zero trust, with the resulting budget allocations. Most planned to increase zero-trust investments for 2022. ""There has been a slight learning curve and hurdles to implementing zero trust, but the benefits are worth it,"" said one respondent from a champion organization. Among these champions, identity and access management was the most frequently implemented component of zero-trust architecture, with 86% reporting its use. ""Any attempt to access the network must be verified,"" said another champion respondent. ""Never trust anything.""",network perimet know exact network essenti maintain organiz secur s strong ident access manag iam polici fundament success deploy zerotrust architectur inde zero trust mean

That’s often true for financial cyberattacks, which have seen a steep rise in the impact of identity fraud, with criminals often sticking with or just reverting to “pre-pandemic” scams and techniques to steal sensitive data from financial firms and their customers, according to a recent report from Javelin Strategy & Research. Identity fraud losses tallied $52 billion last year, affecting at least 42 million American adults, as hackers moved more aggressively into “hijacking victims’ online lives,” per Javelin Strategy and Research’s 2022 ""Identity Fraud Study: The Virtual Battleground."" Click here for details about the 13th annual Identiverse conference in Denver, Colorado, June 21-24 Raj Dasgupta, director of fraud strategy at BioCatch, which subsidized the identity fraud study, said he was most surprised by the whopping 90% increase in account takeover from 2020, to $11.4 billion, in 2021. “With more people being forced to transact digitally because of the pandemic, the less digitally savvy among them are particularly vulnerable to fraudsters extracting confidential information from them and taking their account over,"" Dasgupta said. And bad actors continued to prove that they are more than happy to continue perpetrating the same scams and intrusions, as long as they continue to work. Indeed, “traditional” identity fraud losses jumped by 79% to $24 billion, compared with 2020 figures. This so-called “traditional identity fraud” impacted at least 15 million Americans, while new account fraud hurt more than 4.9 million Americans, and tallied $6.7 billion of losses, per the Javelin Strategy & Research study. “Criminals reverted to pre-pandemic tactics in 2021 by focusing on virtual attack vectors such as bots, malware and a variety of identity fraud scams,” said John Buzzard, Javelin’s lead fraud and security analyst, in the release regarding the report. “Further, the 2021 data has shown criminals will change strategies to evade detection and maximize the amount of information they can extract from victims.” Now in its 19th year, the study pointed out major shifts in the various forms of identity fraud, and how it impacts U.S. financial firms and their customers, especially regarding account takeover and new financial account fraud, which has more than doubled in one year. The report also found that new account fraud increased 109%, with criminals in possession of consumer information, which allows them to open multiple unauthorized credit accounts. Fraud affecting existing credit cards rose 69%, while fraud on existing non-card accounts, including checking and insurance, jumped 73%. The impact of identity fraud substantially increased, as the average per-victim loss from traditional identity fraud rose by $201 to $1,551, with identity fraud scams costing an average of $1,029 per victim. And that’s not even counting the time invested in rectifying identity theft issues; the report found that ID theft victims spent an average of nine hours resolving their issues. “The 2021 losses are staggering and underscore how damaging identity fraud has become,” Kathy Stokes, director of Fraud Prevention Programs at AARP, said in a press release. “Institutions must show empathy for the financial and emotional toll that identity fraud takes on its victims, who expect — and deserve — to be treated with respect, regardless of their situation.” The Javelin study also found that the majority of financial fraud victims (54%) want their financial institution to provide fraud prevention resources and help them resolve their fraud issues. Javelin’s 2022 ID Fraud survey was conducted online among 5,000 U.S. adults over the age of 18, using a sample representative of the U.S. census demographics distribution.

71,,GitHub Advanced Security Now Scans For Secrets With Each Push,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33291/GitHub-Advanced-Security-Now-Scans-For-Secrets-With-Each-Push.html,"/04/5,","GitHub announced Monday that, as part of its Advanced Security offering, it would scan for private token information every time a user pushes code, proactively preventing tokens from being leaked. Push protection includes 69 different token types, but not all of the tokens available for the automated ""secret scans"" of published code. Since the new feature is, by design, meant to place protection in the middle of a project workflow, GitHub prioritized scans that produced the highest signal-to-noise ratio. ""GitHub secret scanning’s new push protection capability embeds secret scanning in the developer workflow. To make this possible without disrupting development productivity, push protection only supports token types that can be detected accurately,"" the company wrote in a blog post. GitHub's list of tokens for push protection includes most of the notable names from its secret scanning program, with notable omissions incuding Facebook and several types of Google tokens. Accidental leaking of private information in GitHub repositories causes real-world problems. SolarWinds reported that an intern left a password exposed in a repository before their breach. A 2019 study found that more than 100,000 repositories had exposed tokens or cryptographic keys. Malicious hackers could easily find these by searching for common token types and variable names used for tokens. GitHub has made an effort to crack down on these kinds of exposures through ""secret scans,"" which look at code that has already been published. For enterprise users, that includes a massive list of token patterns that GitHub will notify the enterprise about. For all users, GitHub will scan for a smaller list of patterns from industry partners, including Facebook, and alert the partner about exposure.The partner can then choose whether to revoke the token. A year ago GitHub changed its own tokens to be easier to identify in code. The new proactive push scans are not on by default.

72,,Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Accounts Breached In Vishing Attack,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33265/Morgan-Stanley-Wealth-Management-Accounts-Breached-In-Vishing-Attack.html,28/03/2022,"Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management said cybercriminals broke into accounts using social engineering attacks, according to reports. Using voice-based phishing, or “vishing,” attackers impersonated the trusted financial firm during phone calls to customers, where they encouraged customers to reveal sensitive personal and financial information including banking or login credentials. The fraud attacks, which largely took place in February, resulted in fraudsters electronically transferring money to their own bank account by initiating payments using the Zelle payment service. The small number of clients impacted by the attack were reimbursed, according to a statement from Morgan Stanly Wealth management. “Unfortunately, the scam that affected some Morgan Stanley Wealth Management customers is not new,” said TAG Cyber Senior Analyst Gary McAlum. He pointed out that this was not so much a breach of Morgan Stanley’s IT systems as it was an account takeover scam that targets individual customers and uses social engineering techniques to circumvent normal authentication controls. “Many other bank customers have been hit with this type of scam in the past,” said McAlum. “What makes this a particularly effective fraud technique is the impersonation of a bank employee, typically representing themselves as a fraud analyst.” In attacks such as these, the fraudster will often spoof caller ID to reflect the customer’s financial institution and start the call by “needing to authenticate” the customer first, said McAlum. In some cases, there may be another fraudster involved who is actually on a call with a bank customer service representative or online at a credential’s recovery screen. “Even if an authentication code is involved, the fraudster will ask the customer to read back the code allowing them, or a partner, to re-use that code to gain access to the account,” he added. “Unauthorized money movement is usually the result. This is a difficult situation for consumers to deal with and the main defense is to be very skeptical of an unexpected call from your financial institution, hang up, and immediately call the institution back on a known valid number, either from a bank statement, online account, or as listed on the back of a credit card.” Morgan Stanley maintains that its own systems were not compromised in this attack. “This compromise was not a result of any action of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and our systems remain secure,” the company explained in a public release. “Your Morgan Stanley Wealth Management account has been flagged to our Customer Call Center so that any callers into the Call Center will be prompted with additional verification. Your previous Morgan Stanley Online account was also disabled.” Tessa Mishoe, senior threat analyst with cybersecurity specialist firm LogicHub, said, “Emails, social media messages, text messages, and even phone calls are all well-known avenues for phishing attacks.” In this case, Mishoe said, a phone call phishing attack was used to breach unknowing users' account data. “The attackers impersonate a trusted group or person to gain a user's trust, then use that relationship to coax a password or similar sensitive information from their target,” Mishoe said. “Users should not trust the phone number a call originates from, as phone numbers can easily be spoofed,” Mishoe said. “Most legitimate organizations will not call you first and request sensitive information from you. If you aren’t sure, hang up and call the number on the service's card or website.” Morgan Stanley also experienced a significant data breach in July 2021, where a ransomware gang stole personal information from the company’s customers, using access through a third-party vendor.",earlier week morgan stanley wealth manag said cybercrimin broke account use social engin attack accord report use voicebas phish vish attack imperson trust financi firm phone call custom encourag custom reveal sensit person financi inform includ bank login credenti fraud attack larg took place februari result fraudster electron transfer money bank account initi payment use zell payment servic small number client impact attack reimburs accord statement morgan stan wealth manag unfortun scam affect morgan stanley wealth manag custom new said tag cyber senior analyst gari mcalum point much breach morgan stanley system account takeov scam target individu custom us social engin techniqu circumv normal authent control mani bank custom hit type scam past said mcalum make particular effect fraud techniqu imperson bank employe typic repres fraud analyst attack fraudster often spoof caller id reflect custom financi institut start call need authent custom first said mcalum case may anoth fraudster involv actual call bank custom servic repres onlin credenti recoveri screen even authent code involv fraudster ask custom read back code allow partner reus code gain access account ad unauthor money movement usual result difficult situat consum deal main defens skeptic unexpect call financi institut hang immedi call institut back known valid number either bank statement onlin account list back credit card morgan stanley maintain system compromis attack compromis result action morgan stanley wealth manag system remain secur compani explain public releas morgan stanley wealth manag account flag custom call center caller call center prompt addit verif previous morgan stanley onlin account also disabl tessa misho senior threat analyst cybersecur specialist firm logichub said email social medium messag text messag even phone call wellknown avenu phish attack case misho said phone call phish attack use breach unknow user account data attack imperson trust group person gain user s trust use relationship coax password similar sensit inform target misho said user trust phone number call origin phone number easili spoof misho said legitim organ call first request sensit inform sure hang call number servic s card websit morgan stanley also experienc signific data breach juli ransomwar gang stole person inform compani custom use access thirdparti vendor ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'data loss', 'fraud', 'phish']"
73,,"Agencies Aware Of Hacking Threats To US, Allied Satellite Networks",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33228/Agencies-Aware-Of-Hacking-Threats-To-US-Allied-Satellite-Networks.html,18/03/2022,"A week after Ukrainian military officials detailed how the hack of Viasat satellite modems caused a “huge loss” in communications right as the Russian army invaded, the FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have issued a new joint advisory warning American and allied satellite owners and operators that they “are aware of possible threats to U.S. and international satellite communication networks.” The language is notable, because in previous cybersecurity advisories put out in the wake of the Russian military build up and invasion, the agencies were always careful to emphasize that there were no “specific or credible threats” driving their warnings. In this case, the hack of a satellite network could provide malicious hackers with a pathway into the network of other victims. ""Successful intrusions into SATCOM networks could create risk in SATCOM network providers’ customer environments,” the agencies warned. The advisory never mentions Russia – or any other country or hacking group – by name, only citing “the current geopolitical situation” and CISA’s “Shields Up” initiative, which was stood up in the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine to proactively harden the cyber defenses of U.S. businesses and organizations ahead of potential cyber conflict between Russia and the West. It also references the U.S. intelligence community’s 2022 annual threat report, which details how countries like Russia and China have incorporated anti-satellite capabilities into their arsenals, something the agencies claim is being done with an eye towards the U.S. Russia in particular “is investing in electronic warfare and directed energy weapons to counter western on-orbit assets…by disrupting or disabling adversary C4ISR capabilities and by disrupting GPS, tactical and satellite communications, and radars” “Russia continues to train its military space elements and field new antisatellite weapons to disrupt and degrade U.S. and allied space capabilities, and it is developing, testing, and fielding an array of nondestructive and destructive counterspace weapons — including jamming and cyberspace capabilities, directed energy weapons, on orbit capabilities, and ground-based ASAT capabilities—to target U.S. and allied satellites,” the assessment notes. The FBI and CISA give a bevy of detection and mitigation advice for satellite operators to focus on. It includes putting additional monitoring in place to search remote access tools (like TelNet and Secure Shell Protocol) communicating with satellite terminals. Such additional monitoring, placed at ingress and egress points to satellite communications equipment, could also pick up unexpected or unauthorized traffic to other networks, access of local or backup accounts and brute force login attempts. For satellite communications network providers and customers, it mostly offers bread and butter advice around good cyber hygiene. Security personnel are advised to implement multifactor authentication for user accounts, use strong passwords, remove access privileges for expired accounts or credentials, monitor network logs for suspicious activity and have a strong incident response plan in place if a breach or compromise does occur. It also references two other resources for network providers and customers: a technical guide for protecting very small aperture terminals (VSAT) communications developed by the National Security Agency earlier this year and the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalogue, a rolling, updated list of software and hardware vulnerabilities that have been used by malicious hackers in the past and that federal agencies must patch within two weeks of notification. In keeping with past warnings, the advisory presses organizations to contact CISA or the FBI watch centers to report incidents and anomalous activity on their network, through either email ([email protected] and [email protected]) or phone (FBI: 855-292-3937, CISA: 888-282-0870).",week ukrainian militari offici detail hack viasat satellit modem caus huge loss communic right russian armi invad fbi cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc issu new joint advisori warn american alli satellit owner oper awar possibl threat u intern satellit communic network languag notabl previous cybersecur advisori put wake russian militari build invas agenc alway care emphas specif credibl threat drive warn case hack satellit network could provid malici hacker pathway network victim success intrus satcom network could creat risk satcom network provid custom environ agenc warn advisori never mention russia – countri hack group – name cite current geopolit situat cisa shield initi stood week lead russian invas ukrain proactiv harden cyber defens u busi organ ahead potenti cyber conflict russia west also refer u intellig communiti annual threat report detail countri like russia china incorpor antisatellit capabl arsenal someth agenc claim done eye toward u russia particular invest electron warfar direct energi weapon counter western onorbit assets…bi disrupt disabl adversari cisr capabl disrupt gps tactic satellit communic radar russia continu train militari space element field new antisatellit weapon disrupt degrad u alli space capabl develop test field array nondestruct destruct counterspac weapon — includ jam cyberspac capabl direct energi weapon orbit capabl groundbas asat capabilities—to target u alli satellit assess note fbi cisa give bevi detect mitig advic satellit oper focus includ put addit monitor place search remot access tool like telnet secur shell protocol communic satellit termin addit monitor place ingr egress point satellit communic equip could also pick unexpect unauthor traffic network access local backup account brute forc login attempt satellit communic network provid custom most offer bread butter advic around good cyber hygien secur personnel advis implement multifactor authent user account use strong password remov access privileg expir account credenti monitor network log suspici activ strong incid respons plan place breach compromis occur also refer two resourc network provid custom technic guid protect small apertur termin vsat communic develop nation secur agenc earlier year known exploit vulner catalogu roll updat list softwar hardwar vulner use malici hacker past feder agenc must patch within two week notif keep past warn advisori press organ contact cisa fbi watch center report incid anomal activ network either email email protect email protect phone fbi cisa ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'russia', 'cyberwar']"

75,,Fraudsters Use Intelligent Bots To Attack Financial Institutions,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33218/Fraudsters-Use-Intelligent-Bots-To-Attack-Financial-Institutions.html,16/03/2022,"Intelligent automated bots are among the newest weapons in the arsenal of cyber criminals, including those seeking to attack financial institutions, as fraud and intrusions increase exponentially on this attack vector. The tactic is increasingly used across sectors, reflecting the volume and value of digital information. “A common phrase heard in the past few years is 'data is the new oil,’” says Kevin Gosschalk, founder and CEO of Arkose Labs in the introduction to his company’s research report, 2022 State of Fraud & Account Security Report. “The digital world now encompasses so much of our everyday lives, and data is the valuable commodity that fuels it. It’s not just commerce that operates largely in the digital realm, but also work, socializing, education and much more.” Indeed, the cybersecurity firm points out that the online “metaverse” could be worth as much as $800 billion by 2024 by Bloomberg Intelligence. “This will lead to an exponentially larger attack surface for fraudsters to target. Rather than just PCs and mobile devices, attackers can compromise smart appliances, connected automobiles and virtual reality devices.” The Arkose report points out that fraud attacks on financial institutions are not only increasing in volume “but also sophistication.” “Bots become more nuanced and advanced by the day; able to mimic good users with increasing accuracy and bypass defenses,” according to the Arkose Labs report. “Automation is the key for attackers to be successful in their endeavors. It allows them to attack at such scale and so inexpensively that only a small percentage of their efforts need to be successful to turn a profit.” At the same time, banks’ business customers are also pouring “time and money into cybersecurity and anti-fraud defenses only to fight a losing battle,” according to Arkose Labs. Indeed, the financial industry faced twice as many cyberattacks in 2021 as the previous year, but the technology space has five times as many and the travel industry saw 12.5 as many attempted onslaughts. The Arkose Labs report also noted a rise in login or registration point attacks, which increased by 85% year over year. ""Once attackers have compromised an existing account, they can monetize it in a number of ways, such as stealing financial information, reselling the credentials, redeeming accrued loyalty points and more,” according to Gosschalk. “Fake new accounts are used for attacks such as inventory hoarding, content scraping, and sending spam and phishing messages.” Indeed, the Arkose Labs report points out that the average person now has more than 100 passwords. “These digital accounts, if they are compromised, give attackers access to then commit a wide range of fraud and abuse beyond just stealing personal information,” according to the report. Login and registration intrusions shot up by 85% last year as compared to 2020, largely by the theft of financial information and credentials. Here again, the Arkose Labs report found that automated services aid in making targeting more enterprises: bots using “scraping” attacks helped compromise at least 45% of traffic on travel sites. Meanwhile, fraudulent accounts tripled last year as compared to 2020, using phishing, scams and the promise of free trial abuse. Attacks on financial firms and financial technology companies were 70% higher last year than in 2020, according to the Arkose Labs’ research. “Throughout the highs and lows of 2021,” the Arkose Labs report said, “businesses experienced spikes in new and reemerging attack types based on the rapidly changing environment.”",intellig autom bot among newest weapon arsenal cyber crimin includ seek attack financi institut fraud intrus increas exponenti attack vector tactic increas use across sector reflect volum valu digit inform common phrase heard past year data new oil say kevin gosschalk founder ceo arkos lab introduct compani research report state fraud account secur report digit world encompass much everyday life data valuabl commod fuel commerc oper larg digit realm also work social educ much more inde cybersecur firm point onlin metavers could worth much billion bloomberg intellig lead exponenti larger attack surfac fraudster target rather pc mobil devic attack compromis smart applianc connect automobil virtual realiti devic arkos report point fraud attack financi institut increas volum also sophist bot becom nuanc advanc day abl mimic good user increas accuraci bypass defens accord arkos lab report autom key attack success endeavor allow attack scale inexpens small percentag effort need success turn profit time bank busi custom also pour time money cybersecur antifraud defens fight lose battl accord arkos lab inde financi industri face twice mani cyberattack previous year technolog space five time mani travel industri saw mani attempt onslaught arkos lab report also note rise login registr point attack increas year year attack compromis exist account monet number way steal financi inform resel credenti redeem accru loyalti point accord gosschalk fake new account use attack inventori hoard content scrape send spam phish messag inde arkos lab report point averag person password digit account compromis give attack access commit wide rang fraud abus beyond steal person inform accord report login registr intrus shot last year compar larg theft financi inform credenti arkos lab report found autom servic aid make target enterpris bot use scrape attack help compromis least traffic travel site meanwhil fraudul account tripl last year compar use phish scam promis free trial abus attack financi firm financi technolog compani higher last year accord arkos lab research throughout high low arkos lab report said busi experienc spike new reemerg attack type base rapid chang environ ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'botnet', 'fraud']"
76,,Chinese APT Zero Days Compromised US State Governments,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33192/Chinese-APT-Zero-Days-Compromised-US-State-Governments.html,"/03/9,","A hacking group tied to the Chinese government has exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in internet-facing web applications — including Log4j — to compromise the networks of at least six U.S. state governments over the past year, according to threat intelligence firm Mandiant. The earliest signs of the campaign were detected in May 2021 and have continued through at least February 2022. Attackers leveraged a number of zero-day vulnerabilities, such as Log4j and a previously undiscovered flaw in USAHerds, a commercial-off-the-shelf application used for tracing animal diseases. The hacking group, APT41, is believed to be associated with the Chinese Ministry of State Security and is known for targeting industries and intellectual property for technologies that are aligned with China’s 13th five-year economic plan, including the telecommunications, health care, and high tech sectors. They have also been observed targeting higher education, media firms and the video game industries, and they are relatively unique as one of the few state-connected APTs that appear to hack both for espionage and financially motivated reasons. Rufus Brown, a senior threat analyst at Mandiant, said the use of Log4j is notable because it demonstrates how quickly some state-sponsored groups were able to move to exploit the vulnerability. Just hours after Log4j was disclosed in December 2021, APT41 began incorporating it into their ongoing campaign to compromise at least two state governments. While there is evidence that APT41 also used Log4j against private insurance and telecommunications firms, the targeting of U.S. state governments in this campaign was specific and deliberate. “They are going after any external web application server that they can exploit... anything they can get to gain a foothold in state government environments,” said Brown. In the weeks following Log4j's disclosure, agencies like the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and private threat intelligence firms initially reported low levels of exploitation by criminal actors for things like cryptocurrency mining, but Brown said there is increasingly evidence that state-backed hacking groups were able to quickly exploit the bug, as well. Meanwhile, the use of another zero-day flaw in USAHerds (CVE-2021-44207) indicates that the victim set could go beyond the initial six states identified by Mandiant. The application uses the same static validation and decryption keys across all applications by default, and the vulnerability exploits this fact to compromise any sever connected to the internet running the application. A GitHub page compiled by Mandiant for the bug states that the bug, now patched, affects all builds for USAHerds prior to November 2021. While it’s not known how APT41 obtained the original machine key values, it would theoretically allow them to exploit the same weakness in other states that use USAHerds. At least 18 states are known to use the software, and Brown said it is likely that other states have been compromised by the flaw and don’t know it. They’re also persistent in two instances Mandiant said it began investigating a compromise at one state agency only to find the group inside the network of another. As recently as Feb. 22, attackers were observed re-compromising the IT systems of two states they had previously broken into, often using different initial access vectors and tactics, techniques and procedures. “The most important takeaway I have is the creativity and operational capability that APT41 has,” Brown said. “They were conducting operations against U.S. state governments and then switched to Log4j when [proofs of concept code] came out in an advisory. They took advantage of what they had.” APT41 has a long history of targeting U.S. and Western technology secrets. Between 2019 and 2020, the Department of Justice indicted five hackers from the group for targeting more than 100 companies in the United States and other countries while seizing hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names and command and control pages used by the group to carry out operations. The victims included software development companies, computer hardware manufacturers, telecommunications providers, social media companies, video game companies, non-profit organizations, universities, think tanks and foreign governments. In some cases the attackers exfiltrated unspecified personally identifiable information (PII), something that would be consistent with the espionage-minded background and goals of previous operations by APT41. However, Brown said that for all six of the state governments where APT41’s presence was detected, the intruders were kicked out before they could complete their full attack chain. As a result, Mandiant is shying away from making a formal assessment of the group’s goals at this time. “We haven’t observed any sign that this campaign is stopping. Whatever they’re going after must be very important,” Brown noted.",hack group tie chines govern exploit zeroday vulner internetfac web applic — includ logj — compromis network least six u state govern past year accord threat intellig firm mandiant earliest sign campaign detect may continu least februari attack leverag number zeroday vulner logj previous undiscov flaw usaherd commercialofftheshelf applic use trace anim diseas hack group apt believ associ chines ministri state secur known target industri intellectu properti technolog align china th fiveyear econom plan includ telecommun health care high tech sector also observ target higher educ medium firm video game industri relat uniqu one stateconnect apt appear hack espionag financi motiv reason rufus brown senior threat analyst mandiant said use logj notabl demonstr quick statesponsor group abl move exploit vulner hour logj disclos decemb apt began incorpor ongo campaign compromis least two state govern evid apt also use logj privat insur telecommun firm target u state govern campaign specif deliber go extern web applic server exploit anyth get gain foothold state govern environ said brown week follow logj s disclosur agenc like cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc cisa privat threat intellig firm initi report low level exploit crimin actor thing like cryptocurr mine brown said increas evid stateback hack group abl quick exploit bug well meanwhil use anoth zeroday flaw usaherd cve indic victim set could go beyond initi six state identifi mandiant applic us static valid decrypt key across applic default vulner exploit fact compromis sever connect internet run applic github page compil mandiant bug state bug patch affect build usaherd prior novemb known apt obtain origin machin key valu would theoret allow exploit weak state use usaherd least state known use softwar brown said like state compromis flaw know also persist two instanc mandiant said began investig compromis one state agenc find group insid network anoth recent feb attack observ recompromis system two state previous broken often use differ initi access vector tactic techniqu procedur import takeaway creativ oper capabl apt brown said conduct oper u state govern switch logj proof concept code came advisori took advantag had apt long histori target u western technolog secret depart justic indict five hacker group target compani unit state countri seiz hundr account server domain name command control page use group carri oper victim includ softwar develop compani comput hardwar manufactur telecommun provid social medium compani video game compani nonprofit organ univers think tank foreign govern case attack exfiltr unspecifi person identifi inform pii someth would consist espionagemind background goal previous oper apt howev brown said six state govern apt presenc detect intrud kick could complet full attack chain result mandiant shi away make formal assess group goal time observ sign campaign stop whatev go must import brown note ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'malware', 'usa', 'china', 'cyberwar', 'zero day']"
77,,7 Vulnerabilities Patched In Axeda IIoT Remote Mgmt Tool,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33186/7-Vulnerabilities-Patched-In-Axeda-IIoT-Remote-Mgmt-Tool.html,"/03/8,","PTC issued patches for seven vulnerabilities, three critical, in its Axeda industrial internet of things remote monitoring and management agent Tuesday. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Forescout's Vedere Labs. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is expected to issue an alert about the vulnerabilities today. PTC acquired Axeda in 2014, producing Axeda alongside its ThingWorx IIoT remote management solutions until 2019 when it sunset Axeda. However, given the longevity of IIoT devices, Axeda is still in use in several systems. Based on Forescout telemetry, it is particularly popular in active use within the medical sector, particularly lab testing and imaging. Unlike traditional remote management software for networks, Axeda is pre-installed in devices. ""It's a tool that typically the device manufacturers will install on the fleet of devices that are sold to customers, and will use that to either provide updates or do some remote servicing, remote maintenance and things like that right on a lot of devices at the same time,"" said Daniel Dos Santos, head of research at Vedere. The critical vulnerabilities include unauthenticated commands in the main agent service that can retrieve information and modify configurations,  and a remote server over port 3076 that will accept commands to download a file to the device, upload a file from the device, run program, query directory/file information, shutdown the server, shutdown the main agent, and retrieve the version of the Axeda agent. It also includes vendor configuration problems where manufacturers using Axeda installed hard-coded credentials across a fleet of devices. Forescout believes that with common installations of industrial products, attackers would need local access to the network to take advantage of the vulnerabilities. But with medical devices, particularly in locations with relatively flat networks spanning extremely diverse users, getting local access may not be a huge problem. The hard-coded credentials problem may have been discovered in part in 2016 when a researcher noticed default credentials installed across ATMs. That discovery was never issued a CVE and does not appear to have received any traction outside a Spanish language blog. Vedere only became aware of the blog after its own research. ""We didn't see any mention to any sort of disclosure process. It really seems, at least to me, like a guy who found it, put it on the internet and that's it. Which kind of brings us to why coordinated vulnerability disclosure and doing it the right way is important,"" said Dos Santos. Four other vulnerabilities were also discovered in Axeda agent. Of particular concern, the main agent allows for unrestricted read access to any file on the disk. The main agent can be shut down, and many of its services can be crashed. Additionally, a text log is exposed. Axeda released an update for manufacturers to implement. Enterprises, Vedere recommends, should inventory and segment devices using the Axeda while they await updates.",ptc issu patch seven vulner three critic axeda industri internet thing remot monitor manag agent tuesday vulner discov forescout s veder lab cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc expect issu alert vulner today ptc acquir axeda produc axeda alongsid thingworx iiot remot manag solut sunset axeda howev given longev iiot devic axeda still use sever system base forescout telemetri particular popular activ use within medic sector particular lab test imag unlik tradit remot manag softwar network axeda preinstal devic s tool typic devic manufactur instal fleet devic sold custom use either provid updat remot servic remot mainten thing like right lot devic time said daniel do santo head research veder critic vulner includ unauthent command main agent servic retriev inform modifi configur remot server port accept command download file devic upload file devic run program queri directoryfil inform shutdown server shutdown main agent retriev version axeda agent also includ vendor configur problem manufactur use axeda instal hardcod credenti across fleet devic forescout belief common instal industri product attack would need local access network take advantag vulner medic devic particular locat relat flat network span extrem divers user get local access may huge problem hardcod credenti problem may discov part research notic default credenti instal across atm discoveri never issu cve appear receiv traction outsid spanish languag blog veder becam awar blog research nt see mention sort disclosur process realli seem least like guy found put internet s kind bring u coordin vulner disclosur right way import said do santo four vulner also discov axeda agent particular concern main agent allow unrestrict read access file disk main agent shut mani servic crash addit text log expos axeda releas updat manufactur implement enterpris veder recommend inventori segment devic use axeda await updat ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'flaw', 'patch']"
78,,MITRE Launches Engage Deception Framework,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33174/MITRE-Launches-Engage-Deception-Framework.html,"/03/4,","MITRE released the first official version of its deception framework Engage on Monday after eight months of operating as a public beta. The finalized version 1.0 is more friendly to inexperienced users, less dependent on a matrix of strategies, and more fine-tuned in language. ""When we started this off we had every intention of releasing our V1 in the fall of last year. We thought maybe a few people would notice the beta in August, when we released it. Maybe we'd get a couple comments and then we would put out V1,"" said Maretta Morovitz, Engage lead at MITRE. Instead, MITRE heard from more than 100 stakeholders, including 30 organizations, 10 focus groups and comments ranging from the official to people reaching out over social media. Engage replaces Shield, MITRE's first attempt at a deception product. Shield was conceptualized as more of a knowledge database, with Engage intended as a strategic guide. Engage separates the broad concept of using fake files or servers into several different potential goals, including alerting defenders to an attack, slowing attackers as they traverse a network and providing intelligence on the attackers as they go. In the public beta, that took the form of a matrix of strategies, MITRE found that many users — new users most of all — needed a product that was a little more user-friendly. The matrix remains at the core of the product, but there are now five other areas on the website for defenders to engage with. There have been minor restructuring of the matrix along the way. The idea of threat modeling is no longer treated as a single activity, and is now split between threat modeling for the enterprise and threat modeling for the adversary. MITRE has also tweaked the language to make sense across the globe, rather than only in its East Coast, U.S. offices. ""It turned out Europeans didn't know what a 'hotwash' was,"" Morovitz said. Deception is growing as a strategic concept. MITRE has been working with vendors in the nascent arena to explain how their products map with the Engage framework. Many have developed the products with tripwire aspects of deception, without as much of a focus on the other strategic benefits it can bring. Morovitz believes that commercially available technologies can often be used in more ways than even their manufacturers currently market. On the flip side, she also believes that smaller enterprises and less experienced defenders may underappreciate what they could accomplish with free canary tokens and open-source honeypots — it does not have to be a million-dollar venture. But the biggest conceptual hurdle MITRE sees potential users grapple with is a belief that using deception in cyberdefense is somehow cheating or less honorable than other defensive technology. ""If you go back to history, armies would way rather win on an open battlefield than have a spy or sneak or deceive. There's this ingrained thing that when you do that, it's less of a win,"" she said. ""It is shocking to me how often you say the word deception and people feel like they immediately need their lawyers in the room."" While the new version of the Engage framework is out, MITRE hopes to build a community around the framework to create more collaboration and support among users of deception. That includes incorporating more behavioral research into the craft. ""You have a lot of engineers thinking about this, but we need to be bringing in the behavioral science people and the academic researchers. We're actually working with researchers and PhD students to figure out how to start engaging that community,"" Morovitz said.",mitr releas first offici version decept framework engag monday eight month oper public beta final version friend inexperienc user le depend matrix strategi finetun languag start everi intent releas v fall last year thought mayb peopl would notic beta august releas mayb d get coupl comment would put v said maretta morovitz engag lead mitr instead mitr heard stakehold includ organ focus group comment rang offici peopl reach social medium engag replac shield mitr s first attempt decept product shield conceptu knowledg databas engag intend strateg guid engag separ broad concept use fake file server sever differ potenti goal includ alert defend attack slow attack travers network provid intellig attack go public beta took form matrix strategi mitr found mani user — new user — need product littl userfriend matrix remain core product five area websit defend engag minor restructur matrix along way idea threat model longer treat singl activ split threat model enterpris threat model adversari mitr also tweak languag make sens across globe rather east coast u offic turn european nt know hotwash morovitz said decept grow strateg concept mitr work vendor nascent arena explain product map engag framework mani develop product tripwir aspect decept without much focus strateg benefit bring morovitz belief commerci avail technolog often use way even manufactur current market flip side also belief smaller enterpris le experienc defend may underappreci could accomplish free canari token opensourc honeypot — milliondollar ventur biggest conceptu hurdl mitr see potenti user grappl belief use decept cyberdefens somehow cheat le honor defens technolog go back histori armi would way rather win open battlefield spi sneak deceiv s ingrain thing s le win said shock often say word decept peopl feel like immedi need lawyer room new version engag framework mitr hope build communiti around framework creat collabor support among user decept includ incorpor behavior research craft lot engin think need bring behavior scienc peopl academ research re actual work research phd student figur start engag communiti morovitz said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'cyberwar']"

Conti generated $180 million in revenue in 2021 according to a Chainalysis report, making it the most active ransomware group for the year. Wednesday evening, Radoje Vasovic, founder of the European cybersecurity firm Cybernite, noted internal chatter from Conti's chat servers discussing the tear-down of the group's infrastructure. ""All VM farms are cleared and deleted, all servers are disabled,"" wrote one member in Russian. The abrupt shutdown of infrastructure follows a rough week for the criminal nuisance. On Friday, Conti issued a statement saying that it would retaliate against Western critical infrastructure if Western nations targeted Russian infrastructure during the Ukraine conflict. That proved to be a misstep with many of Conti's business partners. Conti, a ransomware-as-a-service provider (RaaS), licenses the use of the ransomware it codes to separate hacker groups, many of whom are based in Ukraine or otherwise backing the Ukraine side of the conflict. One group retaliated by leaking source code and internal chat logs, implicating Conti as taking orders from Russian intelligence during one operation. After the damage to Conti became clear, rival RaaS group LockBit issued its own statement, declaring neutrality. Allan Liska, a ransomware intelligence expert with Recorded Future, audited around 25 back-end and command-and-control servers mentioned in the leaks, all of which were offline. Conti's clients appear to be jumping ship.  ""Affiliates are already hopping to other RaaS offerings,"" said Liska Conti's extortion server, at present, is still online. Dismantling internal infrastructure is not a good sign for the group, but many ransomware groups have successfully rebranded and relaunched in the past. ""Ransomware groups have been resilient before, but we've also never seen a disaster like this,"" said Liska. ""There is an assumption they will rebrand.

80,,Senate Approves Cyber Incident Reporting Rule,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33164/Senate-Approves-Cyber-Incident-Reporting-Rule.html,"/03/2,","The Senate unanimously passed legislation Tuesday night that would require critical infrastructure entities to report to the federal government when they are hacked, update the government’s information security hierarchy and codify the government’s primary cloud security certification program. The Strengthening American Cybersecurity Act is actually three separate bills jammed into one legislative vehicle. One, the Cyber Incident Reporting Act, would require critical infrastructure owners to report to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) within 72 hours when they are hacked or suffer a significant cyber incident. Another modernizes the Federal Information Security Management Act, the primary law governing the cybersecurity of civilian agencies, and incorporates newer entities like CISA and the national cyber director into the federal reporting chain. A third is designed to codify FedRAMP, the civilian government’s cloud security certification program, into law and better account for vulnerabilities in the software supply chains of cloud service providers. A Senate aide told SC Media that there are still outstanding differences between the House and Senate regarding the FISMA overhaul that will need to be worked out (for example, the House version codifies the federal chief information security officer role while the Senate version does not). “At a time when we are facing significant threats of Russian cyberattacks against our institutions and our allies, it’s more important than ever that the government have an idea of what those threats are,"" said Sen.

""I am glad the Senate has passed our bipartisan cyber incident reporting bill, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to get a final version of this legislation to the president’s desk as soon as possible.” Requiring critical infrastructure — entities that are largely private owned but whose operations are essential to the functioning of American society — to report breaches and other serious incidents has been one of the highest cybersecurity priorities in Congress over the past year as food producers, oil and gas pipelines, manufacturers, state and local governments and schools have come under relentless attack from ransomware groups, while defense contractors and other sectors have had their systems breached and purloined of sensitive trade secrets by foreign intelligence agencies and state-backed hacking groups. It will give CISA unprecedented insight into how many companies deemed crucial to the delivery of services and the global supply chain are affected by the problem, and infuse discussions about federal resource allocation and technical assistance with more granular data. Sen. Gary Peters, one of the chief sponsors of the bill who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, has said passing all three bills was a major priority for his committee, particularly in light of the potential for Russian-directed cyberattacks on American soil in response to economic sanctions from the West. ""We believe time is of the essence and particularly given the potential threat of Russian activity as a result of what’s happening in the Ukraine, that it's critically important for our cybersecurity agencies to have every tool in their toolbox,"" Peters told SC Media earlier this month.",senat unanim pass legisl tuesday night would requir critic infrastructur entiti report feder govern hack updat govern inform secur hierarchi codifi govern primari cloud secur certif program strengthen american cybersecur act actual three separ bill jam one legisl vehicl one cyber incid report act would requir critic infrastructur owner report cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc cisa within hour hack suffer signific cyber incid anoth modern feder inform secur manag act primari law govern cybersecur civilian agenc incorpor newer entiti like cisa nation cyber director feder report chain third design codifi fedramp civilian govern cloud secur certif program law better account vulner softwar suppli chain cloud servic provid senat aid told sc medium still outstand differ hous senat regard fisma overhaul need work exampl hous version codifi feder chief inform secur offic role senat version time face signific threat russian cyberattack institut alli import ever govern idea threat said sen mark warner dva glad senat pass bipartisan cyber incid report bill look forward work colleagu hous get final version legisl presid desk soon possibl requir critic infrastructur — entiti larg privat own whose oper essenti function american societi — report breach serious incid one highest cybersecur prioriti congress past year food produc oil gas pipelin manufactur state local govern school come relentless attack ransomwar group defens contractor sector system breach purloin sensit trade secret foreign intellig agenc stateback hack group give cisa unpreced insight mani compani deem crucial deliveri servic global suppli chain affect problem infus discuss feder resourc alloc technic assist granular data sen gari peter one chief sponsor bill chair homeland secur committe said pass three bill major prioriti committe particular light potenti russiandirect cyberattack american soil respons econom sanction west believ time essenc particular given potenti threat russian activ result happen ukrain s critic import cybersecur agenc everi tool toolbox peter told sc medium earlier month ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'usa', 'data loss']"
81,,Payment Card Skimming Reemerges With An Online Twist,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33135/Payment-Card-Skimming-Reemerges-With-An-Online-Twist.html,22/02/2022,"Card skimming has been around since before the mainstream internet and is undergoing a renaissance as financial fraudsters are recognizing new opportunities to combine physical world data theft with online intrusion to steal even more money and information than before. Just a week ago, it was reported that roughly 500 online retail sites fell prey to a massive “card skimming” incident, wherein bad actors installed a device that allowed them to copy and swipe the data off legitimate debit and credit card as they were being used for payments. In the past, card skimming thieves would insert a physical device into ATMs or payment terminals that would hijack the information off of valid customers’ payment cards. Nowadays, as online shopping is booming more than ever, these cyber thieves are using malware inserted onto the checkout page of online commerce sites to collect the card information, which they can resell or use in their own nefarious schemes. Malware and vulnerability detection company Sansec, which works with more than 7,000 online retailers, was one of the first to spot this malicious card skimming activity earlier this month. The vendor recommends “cleansing” the retail sites that have been affected, in order to root out the malicious code, but experts fear that these cyber-skimmers will simply shift their approach and find “backdoors” through which they can implement their viruses. The Magecart group of cybercriminals has been seen at the heart of many of these new card-skimming attacks, as well as other card information theft schemes where the card is not physically present at the time of purchase. Furthermore, this problem could become more exacerbated as mobile phones begin to add card readers, too. Card swipe or dip devices for physically reading payment card chips have long been an ancillary add-on for mobile devices — making them useful as payment terminals. But Apple announced earlier this month that it will be adding a new “Tap to Pay” feature that would allow users to make contactless card payments between iPhones without adding any additional hardware dongles. But financial institutions, payments companies and retailers who are impacted by these skimming attacks are not taking this lying down. Earlier this month, Target, which has in the past made headlines as the victim of cyber intrusion, has released its own “web-skimming detection tool” as an open-source tool aimed at detecting malicious code that bad actors have inserted to grab payment card information online. Dubbed “Merry Maker,” the retailer is promoting this technology as “a proactive defense... to defend against digital skimming,” according to the Target.com website. The technology has been used as a client-side “scanner” at Target’s website for more than three years. “Merry Maker continually simulates online browsing and completes test transactions to scan for the presence of malicious code,” according to a Target blog post about the release of the open-source tool. “Merry Maker acts like a guest on Target.com by completing several typical activities including online purchases. While doing so, the tool gathers and analyzes a variety of information including network requests, JavaScript files, and browser activity to determine if there’s any type of unwanted activity.”",card skim around sinc mainstream internet undergo renaiss financi fraudster recogn new opportun combin physic world data theft onlin intrus steal even money inform week ago report rough onlin retail site fell prey massiv card skim incid wherein bad actor instal devic allow copi swipe data legitim debit credit card use payment past card skim thief would insert physic devic atm payment termin would hijack inform valid custom payment card nowaday onlin shop boom ever cyber thief use malwar insert onto checkout page onlin commerc site collect card inform resel use nefari scheme malwar vulner detect compani sansec work onlin retail one first spot malici card skim activ earlier month vendor recommend cleans retail site affect order root malici code expert fear cyberskimm simpli shift approach find backdoor implement virus magecart group cybercrimin seen heart mani new cardskim attack well card inform theft scheme card physic present time purchas furthermor problem could becom exacerb mobil phone begin add card reader card swipe dip devic physic read payment card chip long ancillari addon mobil devic — make use payment termin appl announc earlier month ad new tap pay featur would allow user make contactless card payment iphon without ad addit hardwar dongl financi institut payment compani retail impact skim attack take lie earlier month target past made headlin victim cyber intrus releas webskim detect tool opensourc tool aim detect malici code bad actor insert grab payment card inform onlin dub merri maker retail promot technolog proactiv defens defend digit skim accord targetcom websit technolog use clientsid scanner target websit three year merri maker continu simul onlin brows complet test transact scan presenc malici code accord target blog post releas opensourc tool merri maker act like guest targetcom complet sever typic activ includ onlin purchas tool gather analyz varieti inform includ network request javascript file browser activ determin type unwant activ ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'fraud']"
82,,US Financial Industry Uniquely Susceptible To Supply Chain Threats,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33134/US-Financial-Industry-Uniquely-Susceptible-To-Supply-Chain-Threats.html,22/02/2022,"Over the past several months, delays in the global supply chain have wreacked havoc on all manner of businesses in the U.S. and abroad. These issues have also impacted financial IT security. Indeed, there has been a jump in cyberattacks across various sectors during the supply chain crisis, according to a recent report from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, especially since so many businesses have “deprioritized cybersecurity over the past year amid the pandemic.” In the United Kingdom, there has been a 30% rise in the number of cyberattacks in the wake of the supply chain issues, according to Kaspersky. Steve Povonly, principal engineer and head of advanced threat research at Trellix, pointed out that supply chain issues are “further compounded when examined with a focus on cybersecurity issues. As we learned from SolarWinds, nation-state threat actors are highly motivated by the attack surface the end-to-end supply chain presents.” “Cyber criminals can leverage unique opportunities to inject anything from malicious hardware to fully functional firmware backdoors to achieve a remote attack,” Povonly said, “and often persistence on the device, with very little likelihood of being discovered.” Povonly said this is because most security audits happen long before or long after the time at which a bad actor is present in the system. Almost three-quarters (72%) of companies surveyed stated cybersecurity threats are their No. 1 concern, but only a third (33%) of respondents said their companies provide necessary internal resources and knowledge to respond, according to Kaspersky. And only about one-third (35%) are “certain” that they have taken every possible step to mitigate third-party risks in their organization, per the Kaspersky report, ""Supply Chain CyberSecurity – Potential Threats and Rising to the Challenge."" “We are constantly assessing the risk profile of the global supply chain and alerting the industry to our concerns,” said Mike Yarwood, Kaspersky managing director for loss prevention, in the report. “One should not underestimate cyber criminals. They are agile, focused and highly sophisticated, presenting a significant threat to businesses in the global supply chain.” As financial firms and their customers emerge from the pandemic, Yarwood recommended that they “re-evaluate their cyber risk policies and urge operators to satisfy themselves that sufficient resources are allocated to addressing this threat.” Supply chain attacks are particularly difficult to suss out as they might begin with bad actors infiltrating virtually any step (or provider) within the supply chain. Since most U.S. financial institutions can depend on dozens, or even hundreds, of third-party providers, the slowdowns in the global supply chain and the potential weaknesses in this system could have huge ramifications on the financial industry. “The financial industry is hardly different than any other products and services industry subject to supply chain woes,” said Povonly. “Card readers, ATMs, crypto chips, and financial software are all staple industry products, and each is uniquely susceptible to supply chain threats,” he added. “This is one of the more enticing areas for exploitation as, by its nature, these systems are responsible for direct financial transactions and provide a shortcut to monetizing supply chain threats.”",past sever month delay global suppli chain wreack havoc manner busi u abroad issu also impact financi secur inde jump cyberattack across various sector suppli chain crisi accord recent report cybersecur firm kasperski especi sinc mani busi depriorit cybersecur past year amid pandem unit kingdom rise number cyberattack wake suppli chain issu accord kasperski steve povon princip engin head advanc threat research trellix point suppli chain issu compound examin focus cybersecur issu learn solarwind nationst threat actor high motiv attack surfac endtoend suppli chain present cyber crimin leverag uniqu opportun inject anyth malici hardwar fulli function firmwar backdoor achiev remot attack povon said often persist devic littl likelihood discov povon said secur audit happen long long time bad actor present system almost threequart compani survey state cybersecur threat concern third respond said compani provid necessari intern resourc knowledg respond accord kasperski onethird certain taken everi possibl step mitig thirdparti risk organ per kasperski report suppli chain cybersecur – potenti threat rise challeng constant assess risk profil global suppli chain alert industri concern said mike yarwood kasperski manag director loss prevent report one underestim cyber crimin agil focus high sophist present signific threat busi global suppli chain financi firm custom emerg pandem yarwood recommend reevalu cyber risk polici urg oper satisfi suffici resourc alloc address threat suppli chain attack particular difficult sus might begin bad actor infiltr virtual step provid within suppli chain sinc u financi institut depend dozen even hundr thirdparti provid slowdown global suppli chain potenti weak system could huge ramif financi industri financi industri hard differ product servic industri subject suppli chain woe said povon card reader atm crypto chip financi softwar stapl industri product uniqu suscept suppli chain threat ad one entic area exploit natur system respons direct financi transact provid shortcut monet suppli chain threat ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'bank']"
83,,Linux Kernel Patches Remote Stack Overflow Bug,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33111/Linux-Kernel-Patches-Remote-Stack-Overflow-Bug.html,15/02/2022,"Appgate detailed a newly disclosed and newly patched Linux kernel bug Tuesday that could cause local and remote code execution, and denial of service. The bug is a stack overflow in the Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) service, the cluster domain socket service in Linux. Different nodes in TIPC communicate using messages and, while TIPC was designed to check to see if a minimum message length is met, it did not check if a maximum message length was met. Exceeding the maximum causes the overflow. ""The vulnerability has been present since the TIPC monitoring framework was introduced in June 2016, impacting versions 4.8 through to 5.17-rc3. A patch has been released; updating systems to include that patch is the best way to mitigate the vulnerability. In the meantime, if you’re not using TIPC, you can blacklist the module to reduce your attack surface,"" said Samuel Page, senior exploit developer for Appgate Threat Advisory Services, in a statement. Page discovered the vulnerability. ""If you need to use TIPC and can’t immediately patch your system, look to enforce configurations that prevent or limit the ability for attackers to imitate nodes in your cluster. Options include TIPC protocol level encryption, IPSec/MACSec and network separation,"" he continued. In the blog post, Page explained that he found the new TIPC vulnerability exploring an old one, as he played around with CVE-2021-43267. CVE-2021-43267 was discovered by SentinelLabs and published in November. The new vulnerability was reported last month. In the process of patching, Page wrote in his blog post, ""another issue regarding [an] overflow was spotted by Eric Dumazet, a fix for which is also included in the final patch by Jon Maloy.""

84,,Microsoft Will Block Macros By Default From Internet Downloads,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33091/Microsoft-Will-Block-Macros-By-Default-From-Internet-Downloads.html,10/02/2022,"Microsoft will make it even more difficult to download and run malicious Office documents from the internet, the company announced this week. It's a change welcomed by security pros. Office macros, which provide programming functions for use in common workplace documents, have been a launching pad for malicious actors since the Clinton administration. The Concept Virus first appeared in 1995. Nearly thirty years later, it is still a problem, despite Microsoft's previous efforts to curb adversarial use. ""While we provided a notification bar to warn users about these macros, users could still decide to enable the macros by clicking a button. Bad actors send macros in Office files to endusers who unknowingly enable them, malicious payloads are delivered, and the impact can be severe, including malware, compromised identity, data loss, and remote access,"" Microsoft's Kellie Eickmeyer wrote in a blog post announcing new measures. Redmond is taking away Windows user's ability to run macros in files downloaded from the internet in a single click. Instead, the notification bar will now lead to a lengthy article explaining why macros can be dangerous and why users should be skeptical of macros they were not expecting to receive that contains instructions on how users can re-enable macros on their document. Documents downloaded from untrusted locations will be given a ""MOTW"" [Mark of the Web] attribute used to block macros. The change will first roll out in the current generation of Office, with fixes for Office LTSC, Office 2021, Office 2019, Office 2016, and Office 2013 being introduced at ""a future date to be determined."" The move was met with enthusiasm across the cybersecurity industry. ""Thank God. It took like 20 years,"" said Rotem Iram, CEO of cyber insurer At-Bay. ""This is the number one way to get into our customer's networks from within email. I mean, how many people use macros anyway? Why was it open by default?"" Macros remain a very common mechanism for attacks because users are particularly diligent in circumventing security mechanisms they think are preventing them from doing their jobs. “We see a fair amount of macro-related threat vectors from nation-states and e-criminals – based on previous experience users will find a way to enable or run malicious content if they think they need it,"" said Adam Meyer, senior vice president for intelligence at CrowdStrike. ""This is the essence of social engineering."" Campaigns have been known to work instructions to enable macros into their lures in the past and are adept to find new ways to find a new place to hide malicious code when an old one becomes more difficult. Microsoft is closing a door, but experts agree several other windows are still wide open. ""Organizations should pair this change with ongoing anti-phishing technology, training techniques, and testing to shape vigilance and security mindfulness."" said Richard Fleeman, vice president of penetration testing ops at Coalfire.",microsoft make even difficult download run malici offic document internet compani announc week s chang welcom secur pro offic macro provid program function use common workplac document launch pad malici actor sinc clinton administr concept virus first appear near thirti year later still problem despit microsoft s previous effort curb adversari use provid notif bar warn user macro user could still decid enabl macro click button bad actor send macro offic file endus unknow enabl malici payload deliv impact sever includ malwar compromis ident data loss remot access microsoft s kelli eickmey wrote blog post announc new measur redmond take away window user s abil run macro file download internet singl click instead notif bar lead lengthi articl explain macro danger user skeptic macro expect receiv contain instruct user reenabl macro document document download untrust locat given motw mark web attribut use block macro chang first roll current generat offic fix offic ltsc offic offic offic offic introduc futur date determin move met enthusiasm across cybersecur industri thank god took like year said rotem iram ceo cyber insur atbay number one way get custom s network within email mean mani peopl use macro anyway open default macro remain common mechan attack user particular dilig circumv secur mechan think prevent job see fair amount macrorel threat vector nationst ecrimin – base previous experi user find way enabl run malici content think need said adam meyer senior vice presid intellig crowdstrik essenc social engin campaign known work instruct enabl macro lure past adept find new way find new place hide malici code old one becom difficult microsoft close door expert agre sever window still wide open organ pair chang ongo antiphish technolog train techniqu test shape vigil secur mind said richard fleeman vice presid penetr test op coalfir ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'microsoft']"
85,,House Passes COMPETES Act For Federal Cyber Programs,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33076/House-Passes-COMPETES-Act-For-Federal-Cyber-Programs.html,"/02/7,","The House narrowly passed a bill Friday that would invest billions of dollars to entice semiconductor chip manufacturers to set up shop in the United States, kick off a range of cybersecurity focused programs at federal agencies and shore up U.S. technology innovation to compete with industries in China and other countries. The America COMPETES Act passed the House 2022-210 on a narrow party line, with Democrat Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., voting against, and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., voting in favor. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, is chair of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee and lead sponsor of the House bill. In floor comments, Johnson, who is retiring from Congress at the end of the year, said the proposed legislation would “usher in an exciting and prosperous future for American competitiveness” that would bolster semiconductor manufacturing, technology research and development, national security, climate health and other areas. “In short, we are acting to address the critical needs identified by the scientific community, industry, academia, and other stakeholders as what they need most to succeed in the 21st century,” Johnson said. The bill would set aside more than $50 billion in federal funds through 2026 to subsidize the domestic manufacturing of semiconductor computer processor chips, which have become critical to operating major parts of society, from computers and smart phones to automobiles, robotics and weapons systems. It will also establish a new fund to provide for “international information and communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities, including to support the development and adoption of secure and trusted telecommunications technologies, secure semiconductors, secure semiconductors supply chains, and other emerging technologies,” according a House Rules Committee breakdown. For years, policymakers have fretted about potential disparities in the semiconductor supply chain, but a global shortage of processor chips has highlighted just how dependent many industries, products and services are on the technology. Now, it’s clear that beyond cybersecurity concerns, this approach can leave the U.S. and other countries in a weak position during times of significant supply chain disruption.   Taiwan is the world’s leading manufacturer of computer processing chips, accounting for more than 60% of the $83.5 billion global foundry market. Much of that comes from a single business, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which accounted for 54% of total foundry revenue last year and is relied on by U.S. tech behemoths like Apple, Qualcomm and others. China is the world's dominant provider of rare metals and minerals — vital components to the production of most modern technologies, including computer chips. Such minerals are actually prevalent around the world, but China is one of the only countries that has built a robust industrial production base to process and refine those materials. COMPETES would tweak a number of authorities that empower the National Institute for Standards and Technology to offer cybersecurity expertise and guidance around a range of issues. The agency would be directed to create new security guidance on the private and open source software supply chain and digital identity management, expand research around quantum computing and artificial intelligence and help U.S. universities protect their sensitive research from cyberespionage. Through the bill the National Science Foundation would also establish a data initiative to measure the cybersecurity workforce as both governments and industries deal with a shortage of qualified cybersecurity employees and often find themselves competing for the same talent. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to provide “outreach and technical assistance” for small communications network providers and promote the use of Open Radio Access Networks and other open networks. For years, U.S. officials have openly worried that smaller and rural telecommunications companies lack trusted domestic manufacturers of telecommunications equipment as well as funds, sometimes relying on cheaper equipment from Chinese companies like Huawei. Under the bill, Commerce would have one year to develop and submit a plan to Congress analyzing gaps and shortfalls in the United States information and communications technology supply chain and codifies the Communications and Security Advisory Council that advises the Federal Communications Commission. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo hailed the bill's passage and called on the Senate and House to work out differences as soon as possible to address chip shortages and signal to industry that the U.S. is open for business. ""We need federal funding to address this shortage because we cannot stimulate American manufacturing without it. Companies will build their facilities in countries that are creating incentives—even if those countries aren’t the US—if we fail to pass this funding now,"" Raimondo said. ""Companies like Samsung and Intel have indicated that their investments are predicated on passage of this chips funding. In the case of Intel, they’ve been very clear that their $20 billion investment could turn into investments of $100 billion. But only if we pass the funding for the CHIPs Act."" Representative Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, predicted COMPETES would ""reduce our dependence on foreign countries by incentivizing more U.S. manufacturing of critical goods and technology,"" as well as ""improve supply chain security"" and boost domestic production of homeland security equipment and supplies. The passage marks a win for a White House that has otherwise struggled to move much of its agenda through a bitterly divided Congress. After a Senate version of the bill was passed last year, House leaders put their own version on the backburner as they tried (and failed) to pass the Build Back Better Act. Late in 2021, members began indicating that the House would move on some version of the bill early in the new year, and the Biden administration began aggressively stumping for the COMPETES Act as a means to combat a number of pressing issues, from semiconductor supply chain shortages to bolstering the nation's STEM and cybersecurity talent pool. The Senate version of the proposed legislation, which contains a number of differences with the House bill, passed the Senate 68-32 last year. House Republicans voted almost universally against it as their Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and others claimed the bill would ""hurt"" U.S. competitiveness and ""reward"" China. An amendment by Rep. Andy Levin, D-Mich., to create a new “secure and privacy protected data system” for postsecondary students was approved an added to the bill.",hous narrowli pass bill friday would invest billion dollar entic semiconductor chip manufactur set shop unit state kick rang cybersecur focus program feder agenc shore u technolog innov compet industri china countri america compet act pass hous narrow parti line democrat stephani murphi dfla vote rep adam kinzing rill vote favor rep eddi bernic johnson dtexa chair hous scienc space technolog committe lead sponsor hous bill floor comment johnson retir congress end year said propos legisl would usher excit prosper futur american competit would bolster semiconductor manufactur technolog research develop nation secur climat health area short act address critic need identifi scientif communiti industri academia stakehold need succeed st centuri johnson said bill would set asid billion feder fund subsid domest manufactur semiconductor comput processor chip becom critic oper major part societi comput smart phone automobil robot weapon system also establish new fund provid intern inform communic technolog secur semiconductor suppli chain activ includ support develop adopt secur trust telecommun technolog secur semiconductor secur semiconductor suppli chain emerg technolog accord hous rule committe breakdown year policymak fret potenti dispar semiconductor suppli chain global shortag processor chip highlight depend mani industri product servic technolog clear beyond cybersecur concern approach leav u countri weak posit time signific suppli chain disrupt taiwan world lead manufactur comput process chip account billion global foundri market much come singl busi taiwan semiconductor manufactur compani account total foundri revenu last year reli u tech behemoth like appl qualcomm other china world domin provid rare metal miner — vital compon product modern technolog includ comput chip miner actual preval around world china one countri built robust industri product base process refin materi compet would tweak number author empow nation institut standard technolog offer cybersecur expertis guidanc around rang issu agenc would direct creat new secur guidanc privat open sourc softwar suppli chain digit ident manag expand research around quantum comput artifici intellig help u univers protect sensit research cyberespionag bill nation scienc foundat would also establish data initi measur cybersecur workforc govern industri deal shortag qualifi cybersecur employe often find compet talent direct secretari commerc provid outreach technic assist small communic network provid promot use open radio access network open network year u offici open worri smaller rural telecommun compani lack trust domest manufactur telecommun equip well fund sometim reli cheaper equip chines compani like huawei bill commerc would one year develop submit plan congress analyz gap shortfal unit state inform communic technolog suppli chain codifi communic secur advisori council advis feder communic commiss secretari commerc gina raimondo hail bill s passag call senat hous work differ soon possibl address chip shortag signal industri u open busi need feder fund address shortag stimul american manufactur without compani build facil countri creat incentives—even countri us—if fail pas fund raimondo said compani like samsung intel indic invest predic passag chip fund case intel clear billion invest could turn invest billion pas fund chip act repres benni thompson dmiss chair hous homeland secur committe predict compet would reduc depend foreign countri incentiv u manufactur critic good technolog well improv suppli chain secur boost domest product homeland secur equip suppli passag mark win white hous otherwis struggl move much agenda bitter divid congress senat version bill pass last year hous leader put version backburn tri fail pas build back better act late member began indic hous would move version bill earli new year biden administr began aggress stump compet act mean combat number press issu semiconductor suppli chain shortag bolster nation s stem cybersecur talent pool senat version propos legisl contain number differ hous bill pass senat last year hous republican vote almost univers minor leader kevin mccarthi rcalif other claim bill would hurt u competit reward china amend rep andi levin dmich creat new secur privaci protect data system postsecondari student approv ad bill ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa']"
86,,Wormhole Blockchain Bridge Taken For More Than $300 Million,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33069/Wormhole-Blockchain-Bridge-Taken-For-More-Than-300-Million.html,"/02/3,","Wormhole, a popular bridge to move cryptocurrency from one blockchain to another, saw 120,000 Ether — approximately $325 million — stolen by hackers in a move that could destabilize the bridge. ""The wormhole network was exploited for 120k wETH [Wormhole Ether]. ETH will be added over the next hours to ensure wETH is backed 1:1. More details to come shortly,"" tweeted Wormhole at 5:30 pm ET. ""ETH will be added over the next hours to ensure wETH is backed 1:1"" Wormhole shut down service to investigate. Two hours later, Wormhole followed up with a tweet saying the vulnerability had been patched. What the vulnerability had been remains unclear. The popular bridge allows interoperability between the Ether and Solana blockchains through smart contracts. But the value is contingent on holding the assets on both chains to back each other in a one-to-one ratio. If the assets disappear, “there are no assets backing the cross-chain token, and then the token no longer has any value. The cross-chain token is of the asset on the other chain. So essentially, it makes the wrap tokens worthless,"" said Max Galka, CEO of the blockchain forensics firm Elementus. Galka said that replacing $325 million in Ether would be complicated without negotiating the return of the stolen funds; it would be a lot of coins to try to purchase in a short period. It would amount to 3.5% of the daily volume of Ether transactions. But, he added, laundering $325 million in cryptocurrency in a way that would allow the criminals to cash out without being caught would be extremely difficult. ""I  would not immediately assume that the funds are completely gone,"" he said. ""That these days it is not trivial to be able to cash out crypto in this size. There have been a lot of cases recently where the funds have been returned."" Galka noted that the first transactions on the criminal wallets took place Tuesday morning and were from the anonymization service Tornado cash, meaning the thieves had at minimum experimented with one such service. Mixers are not, however, designed to handle hundreds of millions of dollars in funds at a time. In several recent cases, large cryptocurrency and DeFi services have been able to negotiate the return of funds with an attacker for a reduced rate after exchanges, coins and other services agree not to accept the stolen loot. The long-term prospects of bridges have been questioned before. Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, argued last month that it was always safer to hold coins on a specific cryptocurrency blockchain rather than a bridge due to the potential of instability of either of the two currencies.

87,,Smart-Chain Financial Site Qubit Hacked For $80 Million,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33057/Smart-Chain-Financial-Site-Qubit-Hacked-For-80-Million.html,31/01/2022,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) is defying security hopes as Qubit Finance, a major decentralized digital finance platform, was taken for $80 million in cryptocurrency by cyber-thieves on Thursday. The largest crypto-hack so far this year was initially reported (and admitted by Qubit) in an incident report released on Medium. The attack happened at approximately 5 p.m. Eastern on Jan. 27. Qubit Finance operate as a bridge between various blockchain providers, like a settlement processing provider might in more conventional financial services transactions, so that digital funds deposited into one type of cryptocurrency can be taken out through another type. Qubit specifically works as a “bridge” between Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) network. Early analysis from researchers at CertiK, which audits cryptocurrency and blockchain enterprises, found that attackers had exploited a “security flaw” within the smart contract code of Qubit’s blockchain, which allowed them to deposit nothing and yet withdraw nearly $80 million through Binance Coin. “As we move from an Ethereum-dominant world to a truly multi-chain world, bridges will only become more important,” CertiK analysts wrote. “People need to move funds from one blockchain to another, but they need to do so in ways that are not susceptible to hackers who can steal more than [$80 million].” The Qubit Finance team released its own statement on Twitter, pleading with the bad actors who stole the funds to negotiate with the blockchain finance go-between, so as to reduce financial impact for all the people who use the blockchain bridge. To that end, Qubit reportedly offered a bug bounty of $250,000 to the hackers to encourage them to return their stolen crypto-funds. Yesterday’s hack on Qubit Finance is the seventh largest criminal exploit experienced by a DeFi platform, which depend on smart contracts as opposed to third parties for clearing and trading funds. Binance Smart Chain has been around less than two years, since April 2020, and has undergone several multi-million dollar attacks, including the $88 million theft committed on Venus Finance last May, $50 taken from Uranium Finance in April 2021, and $31 million snagged by hackers from Meerkat Finance the month before that, March 2021. Keegan Francis, cryptocurrency and bitcoin specialist for Finder, believes that despite such attacks, cryptocurrency exchanges “are actually setting an amazing example for how financial security of the future will look.” While he admits that there have been numerous hacks of exchanges in the short time cryptocurrencies have been around, Francis says that “these hacks are happening less and less over time as the consequences for not implementing sufficient security are permanent and catastrophic for the business. Exchanges have ended up implementing sophisticated compliance and security measures to ensure the security of their customers' money.” ",decentr financ defi defi secur hope qubit financ major decentr digit financ platform taken million cryptocurr cyberthiev thursday largest cryptohack far year initi report admit qubit incid report releas medium attack happen approxim pm eastern jan qubit financ oper bridg various blockchain provid like settlement process provid might convent financi servic transact digit fund deposit one type cryptocurr taken anoth type qubit specif work bridg ethereum binanc smart chain bsc network earli analysi research certik audit cryptocurr blockchain enterpris found attack exploit secur flaw within smart contract code qubit blockchain allow deposit noth yet withdraw near million binanc coin move ethereumdomin world truli multichain world bridg becom import certik analyst wrote peopl need move fund one blockchain anoth need way suscept hacker steal million qubit financ team releas statement twitter plead bad actor stole fund negoti blockchain financ gobetween reduc financi impact peopl use blockchain bridg end qubit report offer bug bounti hacker encourag return stolen cryptofund yesterday hack qubit financ seventh largest crimin exploit experienc defi platform depend smart contract oppos third parti clear trade fund binanc smart chain around le two year sinc april undergon sever multimillion dollar attack includ million theft commit venus financ last may taken uranium financ april million snag hacker meerkat financ month march keegan franci cryptocurr bitcoin specialist finder belief despit attack cryptocurr exchang actual set amaz exampl financi secur futur look admit numer hack exchang short time cryptocurr around franci say hack happen le le time consequ implement suffici secur perman catastroph busi exchang end implement sophist complianc secur measur ensur secur custom money ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'cybercrime', 'fraud']"

All systems are down, including the phone systems, as TRH investigates the security incident and works to safely restore the impacted systems. The phone lines are fully operational for the walk-in clinic, orthopedic group, pediatrics, surgical associates and oncology. “In the meantime, TRH continues to provide quality care to our patients,” officials said in a statement. “We appreciate the community's patience and understanding, and we apologize for the inconvenience caused by this event.” Patients are continuing to be seen, but reports show there have been a number of care disruptions. Routine outpatient lab services have been limited to set, reduced hours, while chemo and STAT orders are only being accepted if needed. All patients must bring in current medications to previously scheduled appointments, along with any written orders for lab services, as clinicians can’t access the online system. TRH is also warning the community to expect longer than normal wait times. Further, the walk-in clinic for COVID-19 testing has been limited to just two hours and only on a first-come, first-serve basis, with TRH warning that they’ll “test during this time as long as our allocated tests are available. And the clinic can’t schedule testing, as previously communicated. On social media, patients are warning that outpatient services were canceled after 2PM on Jan. 25. Another individual explained the hospital is unable to process any lab results or fax any provider outside of the TRH network or patient. All lab copies are being hand-written and clinicians can’t review reference ranges, meaning the hospital can’t consider the results as final as part of its accreditation standards. The social media post also shows TRH clinicians can’t access any labs completed in the computer system prior to being forced into EHR downtime with the attack on Jan. 19. TRH is continuing to work on a plan moving forward to gain access to the reference lab, offsite fax, and LabCorp, but the downtime “is taking longer than expected.” But those plans won’t “help labs collected prior to this week.” The downtime was clearly unexpected, and services will remain limited until the systems come back online.",cyberattack struck taylor region hospit trh earlier week led electron health record downtim procedur network outag accord notic post kentucki hospit websit system includ phone system trh investig secur incid work safe restor impact system phone line fulli oper walkin clinic orthoped group pediatr surgic associ oncolog meantim trh continu provid qualiti care patient offici said statement appreci communiti s patienc understand apolog inconveni caus event patient continu seen report show number care disrupt routin outpati lab servic limit set reduc hour chemo stat order accept need patient must bring current medic previous schedul appoint along written order lab servic clinician access onlin system trh also warn communiti expect longer normal wait time walkin clinic covid test limit two hour firstcom firstserv basi trh warn test time long alloc test avail clinic schedul test previous communic social medium patient warn outpati servic cancel pm jan anoth individu explain hospit unabl process lab result fax provid outsid trh network patient lab copi handwritten clinician review refer rang mean hospit consid result final part accredit standard social medium post also show trh clinician access lab complet comput system prior forc ehr downtim attack jan trh continu work plan move forward gain access refer lab offsit fax labcorp downtim take longer expect plan help lab collect prior week downtim clear unexpect servic remain limit system come back onlin ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'denial of service']"
89,,What Enterprises Should Learn From Merck's $1.4 Billion Insurance Lawsuit,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33043/What-Enterprises-Should-Learn-From-Mercks-1.4-Billion-Insurance-Lawsuit.html,26/01/2022,"Earlier this month, pharma-giant Merck won a $1.4 billion lawsuit over insurance companies' duty to pay for the damages stemming from the 2017 NotPetya cyberattack. Though insurance has shifted a lot in the cyber realm since 2017, the case is still a learning opportunity for enterprises. NotPetya was a catastrophe, causing untold billions of dollars of damage worldwide through wiper malware designed to look like ransomware. The consensus among Western nations is that NotPetya was a Russian attack on Ukraine that globally ran amuck, causing companies like Merck to suffer massive losses. Merck's insurance, like the vast majority of insurance, had a clause excluding acts of war. But a New Jersey judge ruled that the clause excluding war was intended for armed conflict, not cyber conflict. If Merck eventually winning seems like good news for enterprises in similar policy situations, it is — but with a caveat. The vagaries of the policy meant it took five years and litigation to recover a substantial amount of losses, something attorney Marcus Christian, a partner at Mayer Brown's cyber and data privacy practice, said most enterprises would undoubtedly like to avoid. ""This kind of problem can manifest itself somewhere else. The act of war exclusion is fairly ubiquitous. How it is worded may vary and the bottom line is a company doesn't have clarity that they need, given how expensive premiums are, they need to make sure that they get that clarity before paying the premium for insurance,"" Christian said. ""It comes down to basic blocking and tackling. Insurance policies are contracts, and with contracts, you need to know what your language happens to be,"" he said. There has been dramatic change in how insurance approaches cybersecurity since 2017. Insurance companies have had to grapple with increasing payouts over the ransomware era, which have led to narrowing coverages and rising rates — and policies have become more specific. In November, Lloyd's of London distributed four new model cyberwar clauses to its syndicate that could be used in cyber policies, covering a range of contingencies and severities. At the time, experts assumed it was a response to the Merck case. And, while Lloyd's is a dominant player in the cyber insurance market, it is not alone in a rush to clarify cyberwar. Merck's policy in 2017, notably, was an all-risk policy not tailored to cyber needs. In recent years, companies have increasingly turned to dedicated policies for cyber risk. ""The Merck case is not about cyber insurance,"" said cyber-insurer Resilience through a spokesman. ""Disputes like the case in Merck highlight the value of true specialty cyber insurance like that provided by Resilience, where the product is designed exclusively to address cyber risk."" The Merck case, paired with spiking ransomware payouts and generally increased cyber risk, has pushed insurers to make policies less nebulous while raising premiums and restricting payouts. That could force enterprises to make some unique decisions, said Drew Schmitt, principal threat intelligence analyst at GuidePoint Security, via email. ""A potential byproduct from more specificity in insurance policies and a likely increase in cyber insurance premiums may be a reconsideration of whether cyber insurance has a positive impact to enterprise risk reduction or whether the funds spent on cyber insurance would be better invested elsewhere to support cybersecurity,"" said Schmitt. ""[But] it may be the motivation that many enterprises need to put more funding and emphasis on proactive cyber security controls and to bolster their reactive incident response capabilities in the event of an intrusion event,"" Schmitt added.",earlier month pharmagi merck billion lawsuit insur compani duti pay damag stem notpetya cyberattack though insur shift lot cyber realm sinc case still learn opportun enterpris notpetya catastroph caus untold billion dollar damag worldwid wiper malwar design look like ransomwar consensus among western nation notpetya russian attack ukrain global ran amuck caus compani like merck suffer massiv loss merck s insur like vast major insur claus exclud act war new jersey judg rule claus exclud war intend arm conflict cyber conflict merck eventu win seem like good news enterpris similar polici situat — caveat vagari polici meant took five year litig recov substanti amount loss someth attorney marcus christian partner mayer brown s cyber data privaci practic said enterpris would undoubt like avoid kind problem manifest somewher els act war exclus fair ubiquit word may vari bottom line compani nt clariti need given expens premium need make sure get clariti pay premium insur christian said come basic block tackl insur polici contract contract need know languag happen said dramat chang insur approach cybersecur sinc insur compani grappl increas payout ransomwar era led narrow coverag rise rate — polici becom specif novemb lloyd s london distribut four new model cyberwar claus syndic could use cyber polici cover rang conting sever time expert assum respons merck case lloyd s domin player cyber insur market alon rush clarifi cyberwar merck s polici notabl allrisk polici tailor cyber need recent year compani increas turn dedic polici cyber risk merck case cyber insur said cyberinsur resili spokesman disput like case merck highlight valu true specialti cyber insur like provid resili product design exclus address cyber risk merck case pair spike ransomwar payout general increas cyber risk push insur make polici le nebul rais premium restrict payout could forc enterpris make uniqu decis said drew schmitt princip threat intellig analyst guidepoint secur via email potenti byproduct specif insur polici like increas cyber insur premium may reconsider whether cyber insur posit impact enterpris risk reduct whether fund spent cyber insur would better invest elsewher support cybersecur said schmitt may motiv mani enterpris need put fund emphasi proactiv cyber secur control bolster reactiv incid respons capabl event intrus event schmitt ad ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'data loss']"
90,,New York Fines EyeMed $600k After Data Breach Investigation Finds Security Flaws,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33042/New-York-Fines-EyeMed-600k-After-Data-Breach-Investigation-Finds-Security-Flaws.html,26/01/2022,"EyeMed reached a $600,000 settlement with the state of New York to resolve a number of allegations against its data security program, revealed during the state’s investigation into the healthcare business associate following a 2020 data breach that impacted 2.1 million individuals. Eyecare giant Luxottica owns EyeMed, which provides vision benefits for a number of health insurance companies. “EyeMed betrayed trust by failing to keep an eye on its own security system, which in turn compromised the personal information of millions of individuals,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.  “Let this agreement signal our continued commitment to holding companies accountable and ensuring that they are looking out for New Yorkers’ best interest,” she added. “My office continues to actively monitor the state for any potential violations, and we will continue to do everything in our power to protect New Yorkers and their personal information.” In December 2020, EyeMed reported falling victim to an email hack that was first discovered several months earlier in July. An attacker gained access to an employee email account and sent phishing emails to contacts found in the account’s address book on July 1. What was not disclosed in EyeMed’s breach notification was that the impacted account was an enrollment account tied to EyeMed clients, and the attacker sent at least 2,000 phishing emails from the account after gaining access. The emails “purported to be a request for proposal to deceive recipients into providing credentials to the attacker. Later the same day, EyeMed’s IT department observed the transmission of these phishing emails from the email account, and received inquiries from clients about the suspicious email.” Further, while the breach notification said the account access was blocked and the mailbox secured on the same day it was discovered, the hack actually began on June 24, a week before it was discovered. EyeMed’s investigation determined the account contained a trove of sensitive information from both current and former vision benefits members of multiple insurance clients, including 484,154 Aetna ACE plan members and 60,545 Tufts Health Plan members. The data included vision and health insurance account and identification numbers, Medicaid or Medicare numbers, driver’s licenses, government IDs, and birth or marriage certificates. For some of the impacted members, the compromised information could include partial or full Social Security numbers, financial data, diagnoses, health conditions, treatments, and other data. The state’s investigation into the data breach revealed further insights into the hacking incident and identified key areas where EyeMed did not meet the requirements of New York’s General Business Law. For one, EyeMed did not have multi-factor authentication implemented on the impacted account, “despite the fact that the account was accessible via a web browser and contained a large volume of consumers’ sensitive personal information.” The report found that the vendor was aware of the importance of MFA for reasonable data protections, as EyeMed required MFA for its virtual private network (VPN) for a number of years prior to the email incident. In addition, investigators determined EyeMed did not employ sufficient password management requirements for the impacted enrollment email account despite the web browser access point. The minimum password requirement for the account was just eight characters. “The password that the attacker used to gain access to the account was insufficiently complex given the sensitivity of the information in the enrollment account,” according to the report. The findings show that EyeMed was aware of the importance of password complexity, as its requirements for accounts with elevated privileges were at least 12 characters. The report shows that EyeMed’s settings allowed six failed login attempts before it would lock out a user. The state also determined EyeMed did not have adequate logging and monitoring of its email accounts, which made “it difficult to investigate security incidents.” EyeMed was using an Office 365 E3 license for the email account at the time of the hack, which provided limited logging capabilities and did not record logs for more than 90 days, or give visibility into user activities. As a result, EyeMEd couldn’t see when email items were accessed, replied to, or forwarded beyond 90 days, nor could they identify when or what a user searched. The forensic cybersecurity firm brought on to investigate the incident in 2020 was thereby unable “to definitively determine what emails or documents were accessed by the unauthorized user.” The investigation also revealed that the hacked account contained customer information from six years prior to the breach, as the account was used by EyeMed clients to change vision coverage and held data that dated back to Jan. 3, 2014. The state asserted “it was unreasonable to leave personal information in the affected email account for up to six years rather than to copy and store such information in more secure systems and delete the older messages from the affected email account, particularly in light of the unreasonable protections for the affected email account at the time of the breach.” The findings show that EyeMed violated the state’s Executive Law and the General Business Law. EyeMed did not confirm or deny the findings. Under the settlement, EyeMed must modify its policies and procedures to adhere to the state’s laws for the collection, use, and maintenance of personal data. The vendor is also required to modify its information security program to, at a minimum, meet the requirements outlined in the report. The security program must meet reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate for the complexity of EyeMed’s operations and the sensitivity of the data in its possession. In addition to improving its authentication, logging, and access posture, EyeMed is now required to encrypt private information as required by the state’s General Business law, “whether stored within the EyeMed computer network, or transmitted electronically within or outside the network, using a reasonable encryption algorithm where technically feasible.” EyeMed is also required to maintain a reasonable pen testing program to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in its network, which must include routine pen testing, risk-based vulnerability ratings, and remediation practices consistent with industry standards. Most importantly, “EyeMed shall permanently delete customer personal information when there is no reasonable business or legal purpose to retain it.” The vendor must pay the $600,000 fine to the state within 45 days and provide certification that it’s met these new security requirements. State settlements over healthcare data breaches have become increasingly common in the last two years, given the pandemic focus and as the Department of Health continues its focus on enforcing the right of access rule outlined in The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. New Jersey has been particularly active in these enforcements, issuing fines for at least four healthcare companies in the last quarter, including Diamond Institute for Infertility and Menopause, Regional Cancer Care Associates, and two mailing and printing vendors. Healthcare provider organizations should view these settlements as a warning and review the investigatory reports to determine how their security programs stack up, particularly with data retention and authentication requirements.",eyem reach settlement state new york resolv number alleg data secur program reveal state investig healthcar busi associ follow data breach impact million individu eyecar giant luxottica own eyem provid vision benefit number health insur compani eyem betray trust fail keep eye secur system turn compromis person inform million individu new york attorney general letitia jame said statement let agreement signal continu commit hold compani account ensur look new yorker best interest ad offic continu activ monitor state potenti violat continu everyth power protect new yorker person inform decemb eyem report fall victim email hack first discov sever month earlier juli attack gain access employe email account sent phish email contact found account address book juli disclos eyem breach notif impact account enrol account tie eyem client attack sent least phish email account gain access email purport request propos deceiv recipi provid credenti attack later day eyem depart observ transmiss phish email email account receiv inquiri client suspici email breach notif said account access block mailbox secur day discov hack actual began june week discov eyem investig determin account contain trove sensit inform current former vision benefit member multipl insur client includ aetna ace plan member tuft health plan member data includ vision health insur account identif number medicaid medicar number driver licens govern id birth marriag certif impact member compromis inform could includ partial full social secur number financi data diagnosi health condit treatment data state investig data breach reveal insight hack incid identifi key area eyem meet requir new york general busi law one eyem multifactor authent implement impact account despit fact account access via web browser contain larg volum consum sensit person inform report found vendor awar import mfa reason data protect eyem requir mfa virtual privat network vpn number year prior email incid addit investig determin eyem employ suffici password manag requir impact enrol email account despit web browser access point minimum password requir account eight charact password attack use gain access account insuffici complex given sensit inform enrol account accord report find show eyem awar import password complex requir account elev privileg least charact report show eyem set allow six fail login attempt would lock user state also determin eyem adequ log monitor email account made difficult investig secur incid eyem use offic e licens email account time hack provid limit log capabl record log day give visibl user activ result eyem see email item access repli forward beyond day could identifi user search forens cybersecur firm brought investig incid therebi unabl definit determin email document access unauthor user investig also reveal hack account contain custom inform six year prior breach account use eyem client chang vision coverag held data date back jan state assert unreason leav person inform affect email account six year rather copi store inform secur system delet older messag affect email account particular light unreason protect affect email account time breach find show eyem violat state execut law general busi law eyem confirm deni find settlement eyem must modifi polici procedur adher state law collect use mainten person data vendor also requir modifi inform secur program minimum meet requir outlin report secur program must meet reason administr technic physic safeguard appropri complex eyem oper sensit data possess addit improv authent log access postur eyem requir encrypt privat inform requir state general busi law whether store within eyem comput network transmit electron within outsid network use reason encrypt algorithm technic feasibl eyem also requir maintain reason pen test program identifi remedi vulner network must includ routin pen test riskbas vulner rate remedi practic consist industri standard import eyem shall perman delet custom person inform reason busi legal purpos retain it vendor must pay fine state within day provid certif met new secur requir state settlement healthcar data breach becom increas common last two year given pandem focus depart health continu focus enforc right access rule outlin health insur portabl account act new jersey particular activ enforc issu fine least four healthcar compani last quarter includ diamond institut infertil menopaus region cancer care associ two mail print vendor healthcar provid organ view settlement warn review investigatori report determin secur program stack particular data retent authent requir ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
91,,"Russia Makes More Arrests, But Cybercrime Harboring Reputation Hard To Shake",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/33033/Russia-Makes-More-Arrests-But-Cybercrime-Harboring-Reputation-Hard-To-Shake.html,25/01/2022,"Russian authorities announced the arrests of four members of the Infraud group over the weekend, according to state media outlet TASS. It is the second such series of arrests in recent weeks for a country that, until recently, had been widely considered a sanctuary for cybercriminals. But experts say it's too soon to consider Russia's harboring days over. ""The Russians are always trying to game the U.S., so they're  not turning over a new leaf, it's calculating how much it will take to pacify the Americans,"" said James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and a former cyber-diplomat for the United States. For years, cybercriminals living in Russia operated with the tacit understanding that Moscow would not investigate anyone targeting foreign victims. That understanding even changed how ransomware is designed — major varieties of ransomware will typically not deploy on a system if Russian-language keyboards are installed. At the same time, Russia used cybercrime as a component of its espionage operations, like in the wiper-disguised-as-ransomware NotPetya. But the surprise arrests of members of the REvil ransomware group two weeks ago by Russian intelligence threw that reputation into question, a shakeup furthered by the weekend arrests of the Infraud group. Neither group was active at the time of arrest. REvil had been a major affiliate ransomware organization until global law enforcement crackdowns on its servers earlier this year. Infraud, which existed until 2018, was a carding and bank account theft ring. Pressuring Russia to take on harboring has been a key component of U.S. strategies toward cybercrime. President Joe Biden made it a central issue of his first summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this year, with several proposals proposing everything from sanctions to visa restrictions if Russia did not comply. ""Russia could have many reasons for taking these actions, which may have nothing to do with wanting to crack down on cybercrime emanating from Russian territory. Thus, it’s too soon to tell what’s going on and why Russia has chosen to arrest these individuals,"" said Michael Daniel, president and CEO of the industry threat-sharing group the Cyber Threat Alliance and former White House cybersecurity coordinator under President Obama.   ""If they remain in custody and face trial, then that would be a big step forward in indicating a turn towards more responsible behavior. On the other hand, if these individuals are quietly released in a few days, with no further action, then the actions might be for show.""  Daniel said he would be pleased to welcome a Russia to the global community fighting against cybercrime, even if he is not entirely sold if that is their current intent. But even if Russia is not fully on board, Lewis said, a half-measure is still far more than no measure. ""[It's] not necessarily bad if it gets a good outcome and it's probably the best we can hope for,"" he said. ""I still count it as a success for the U.S. as it put the Kremlin on notice.""",russian author announc arrest four member infraud group weekend accord state medium outlet ta second seri arrest recent week countri recent wide consid sanctuari cybercrimin expert say s soon consid russia s harbor day russian alway tri game u theyr turn new leaf s calcul much take pacifi american said jame lewi director strateg technolog program center strateg intern studi former cyberdiplomat unit state year cybercrimin live russia oper tacit understand moscow would investig anyon target foreign victim understand even chang ransomwar design — major varieti ransomwar typic deploy system russianlanguag keyboard instal time russia use cybercrim compon espionag oper like wiperdisguisedasransomwar notpetya surpris arrest member revil ransomwar group two week ago russian intellig threw reput question shakeup further weekend arrest infraud group neither group activ time arrest revil major affili ransomwar organ global law enforc crackdown server earlier year infraud exist card bank account theft ring pressur russia take harbor key compon u strategi toward cybercrim presid joe biden made central issu first summit russian presid vladimir putin earlier year sever propos propos everyth sanction visa restrict russia compli russia could mani reason take action may noth want crack cybercrim eman russian territori thus soon tell go russia chosen arrest individu said michael daniel presid ceo industri threatshar group cyber threat allianc former white hous cybersecur coordin presid obama remain custodi face trial would big step forward indic turn toward respons behavior hand individu quiet releas day action action might show daniel said would pleas welcom russia global communiti fight cybercrim even entir sold current intent even russia fulli board lewi said halfmeasur still far measur s necessarili bad get good outcom s probabl best hope said still count success u put kremlin notic ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'malware', 'russia', 'cybercrime']"

VPNLab[.]net allegedly provided cover for at least 150 ransomware attacks, according to Ukrainian law enforcement, netting approximately 60 million euros in ransom. The service was headquartered in Germany, where the Hannover police led the investigation. ""One important aspect of this action is also to show that, if service providers support illegal action and do not provide any information on legal requests from law enforcement authorities, that these services are not bulletproof,"" said Hannover Chief of Police Volker Kluwe, in a statement. Europol described the service as ""a popular choice for cybercriminals."" The nations involved in the takedown included Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine, the United States and the United Kingdom. Europol and Eurojust provided additional support, including hosting more than 60 coordination meetings. Ransomware is a complex economy, where several enterprises utilize several different suppliers, with the ability to shift from one to another. Experts note that law enforcement needs to target the high-profile ransomware brands, the lower profile affiliates, as well as the services they use (including VPNs). In September, the United States sanctioned a cryptocurrency exchange popular with ransomware actors.

Further, victims have been given “no assurance… from BioPlus that all personal data or copies of data have been recovered or destroyed.” What’s interesting is that the public notice does not include the data theft language, but the lawsuit states that the patient “received a notification letter from BioPlus stating that her sensitive PII was taken.” The hack was discovered by BioPlus on Nov. 11, but the systems’ intrusion began nearly a month earlier on Oct. 25. The investigation that followed confirmed the threat actor accessed a range of information belonging to 350,000 former and current patients. The exposed data could include dates of birth, health plan member ID numbers, claims data, medical record numbers, diagnoses, and or prescription details. The actors also accessed the Social Security numbers of a smaller subset of patients. The lawsuit, filed on Jan. 5 in the U.S. Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division, alleges that the data exposed during the hack was leaked on the dark web by the attackers. To make matters worse, a patient named Patricia White claims that BioPlus shouldn’t have had her data in the first place. White claims her information was entered into the BioPlus system in 2015 due to a “clerical error,” which resulted in her prescription information being sent from her provider to BioPlus instead of her in-network pharmacy. The patient informed the parties of the mistake and canceled the BioPlus service. However, “her information remained in [BioPlus]’s systems, vulnerable to misuse, until the data breach occurred in November of 2021.”  In addition, one month after the initial hack, White received a notice from her credit monitoring services vendor that her information appeared on the dark web and was shared on a forum for trading sensitive patient information used in health insurance and other banking scams. The lawsuit asserts the data theft was caused by BioPlus, for its “failure to exercise reasonable care” in securing sensitive protected health information and personally identifiable information. The alleged failures “enabled the hackers to steal the private Information”... and put patients’ “information at a serious, immediate, and ongoing risk.” As a result of the theft, patients are now burdened with the costs of recovery and “loss of productivity from taking time to address and attempt to ameliorate the release of personal data, as well as emotional grief associated with constant monitoring of personal banking and credit accounts.” The language surrounding the claims of harm mirror recent breach-related lawsuits, centering around constant monitoring of accounts, ongoing efforts to prevent fraud attempts, and “the imposition of withdrawal and purchase limits on compromised accounts.” BioPlus did offer a year of free credit monitoring services to all breach victims, the lawsuit takes issue with the lack of assurances about the security of patient information. It further claims that to receive the provided services, the data of individuals would “be shared with third parties and could not guarantee complete privacy of her sensitive PII.” As a result, the victims who filed the lawsuit chose not to give the vendor any more data to receive those services. Just one of the two victims who filed the lawsuit provided evidence of data misuse. The breach victims are seeking declaratory relief for claims of negligence, as well as breach of contract, implied contract, and fiduciary duty. Lastly, the lawsuit also takes issue with the three month delay in notification. However, the disclosure was well-within the 60-day timeline from discovery to notification, outlined in The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Breach lawsuits have become increasingly common in the healthcare sector in light of the steady stream of security incidents. At least three other suits were filed in the last month and include Planned Parenthood LA, QRS, and Bansley and Kiener.",bioplus specialti pharmaci servic face classact data breach lawsuit follow recent disclosur weekslong network hack result unauthor access former current patientrel inform lawsuit claim incid caus vendor inadequ secur measur rais question breach breach notic describ incid unauthor access patient inform lawsuit alleg data exfiltr network victim given assurance… bioplus person data copi data recov destroy interest public notic includ data theft languag lawsuit state patient receiv notif letter bioplus state sensit pii taken hack discov bioplus nov system intrus began near month earlier oct investig follow confirm threat actor access rang inform belong former current patient expos data could includ date birth health plan member id number claim data medic record number diagnosi prescript detail actor also access social secur number smaller subset patient lawsuit file jan u middl district florida orlando divis alleg data expos hack leak dark web attack make matter wors patient name patricia white claim bioplus data first place white claim inform enter bioplus system due cleric error result prescript inform sent provid bioplus instead innetwork pharmaci patient inform parti mistak cancel bioplus servic howev inform remain bioplus system vulner misus data breach occur novemb addit one month initi hack white receiv notic credit monitor servic vendor inform appear dark web share forum trade sensit patient inform use health insur bank scam lawsuit assert data theft caus bioplus failur exercis reason care secur sensit protect health inform person identifi inform alleg failur enabl hacker steal privat inform put patient inform serious immedi ongo risk result theft patient burden cost recoveri loss product take time address attempt amelior releas person data well emot grief associ constant monitor person bank credit account languag surround claim harm mirror recent breachrel lawsuit center around constant monitor account ongo effort prevent fraud attempt imposit withdraw purchas limit compromis account bioplus offer year free credit monitor servic breach victim lawsuit take issu lack assur secur patient inform claim receiv provid servic data individu would share third parti could guarante complet privaci sensit pii result victim file lawsuit chose give vendor data receiv servic one two victim file lawsuit provid evid data misus breach victim seek declaratori relief claim neglig well breach contract impli contract fiduciari duti last lawsuit also take issu three month delay notif howev disclosur wellwithin day timelin discoveri notif outlin health insur portabl account act breach lawsuit becom increas common healthcar sector light steadi stream secur incid least three suit file last month includ plan parenthood la qrs bansley kiener ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
94,,Warning: Log4j Still Lurks Where Dependency Analysis Can't Find It,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32970/Warning-Log4j-Still-Lurks-Where-Dependency-Analysis-Cant-Find-It.html,"/01/6,","The best programming practice to include a third-party library in source code is to use the import command. It is the easiest way to do it, and it is also the way that most dependency analysis programs work to determine if a vulnerable library is in play. But any time code is included without calling it as an external package, traditional dependency analysis might not be enough to find it — including when Java coders use a common trick to resolve conflicting dependencies during the design process. A new study by jFrog found that 400 packages on repository Maven Central used Log4j code without calling it as an external package. Around a third of that came from fat jars — jar files that include all external dependencies to make a more efficient product. The remainder came from directly inserting Log4j code into the source code, including shading, a work-around used when two or more dependencies call different versions of the same library in a way that might conflict. While 400 may not seem like a lot for Maven Central, where Google found 17,000 packages implementing the vulnerable Log4j library, some of the 400 packages unearthed by JFrog are widely used. ""Some of the packages, we were familiar with. Some are commercially backed, some are maintained by the community. Some were pretty significant,"" said Asaf Karas, chief technology officer of JFrog Security Research. JFrog scanned Maven Central using an in-depth open-source scanner it released on December 28. Karas suggests enterprises apply to their own java applications. Maven Central's packages may be indicative of how corporations coded their own internal and product software. While the 400 packages contain unlisted Log4j, around 70% of the time, they did contain dependencies using Log4j that might light up a scanner (albeit pointing in a different direction). JFrog has not yet released the names of the potentially vulnerable packages it discovered on Maven Central while it completes disclosure. ""It's a process where we're trying to really understand which are the ones that are the most popular and then disclose that information there first,"" said Karas ""But we didn't want to postpone the fact that people should be aware that this kind of threat exists.""",best program practic includ thirdparti librari sourc code use import command easiest way also way depend analysi program work determin vulner librari play time code includ without call extern packag tradit depend analysi might enough find — includ java coder use common trick resolv conflict depend design process new studi jfrog found packag repositori maven central use logj code without call extern packag around third came fat jar — jar file includ extern depend make effici product remaind came direct insert logj code sourc code includ shade workaround use two depend call differ version librari way might conflict may seem like lot maven central googl found packag implement vulner logj librari packag unearth jfrog wide use packag familiar commerci back maintain communiti pretti signific said asaf kara chief technolog offic jfrog secur research jfrog scan maven central use indepth opensourc scanner releas decemb kara suggest enterpris appli java applic maven central s packag may indic corpor code intern product softwar packag contain unlist logj around time contain depend use logj might light scanner albeit point differ direct jfrog yet releas name potenti vulner packag discov maven central complet disclosur s process re tri realli understand one popular disclos inform first said kara nt want postpon fact peopl awar kind threat exist ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'data loss', 'flaw', 'backdoor', 'java']"
95,,Chinese Espionage Group Leveraged Log4j Bug In VMware,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32952/Chinese-Espionage-Group-Leveraged-Log4j-Bug-In-VMware.html,29/12/2021,"CrowdStrike reported on Wednesday that it detected a Chinese-affiliated espionage group it tracks as Aquatic Panda attempting to leverage the Log4j vulnerability in VMware's Horizon Tomcat webserver service. The company's Falcon OverWatch threat hunting service claims it detected and denied an attempted Log4j breach at an unnamed academic institution. ""While we cannot directly state that we are seeing broader use of this particular vulnerability by espionage actors, its viability as an access method is already proven,"" said Param Singh, CrowdStrike’s vice president of Falcon OverWatch in an email. VMware first issued guidance and workarounds for different Horizon components on December 14, which lead OverWatch to investigate client usage of the products. VMware has continued to update the guidance website on Log4j, most recently on December 23. During the attack, Aquatic Panda used a modified version of the Log4j exploit. The espionage group drew CrowdStrike's attention by attempting to use Linux Bash commands on the Windows host machine to launch an interactive shell. From there, the group attempted to download what CrowdStrike believes was a reverse shell encoded as three files with the VBS extension. Finally, the group tried several times to harvest credentials by dumping the memory of the Windows Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS). Singh noted that the same reasons that make Log4j attractive for use by malicious hackers may ultimately make it less attractive for widespread use by espionage groups. ""Many security vendors have developed detection and alerting mechanisms for when this exploitation occurs which make use of this vulnerability less attractive to advanced threat actors,"" he said.",crowdstrik report wednesday detect chineseaffili espionag group track aquat panda attempt leverag logj vulner vmware s horizon tomcat webserv servic compani s falcon overwatch threat hunt servic claim detect deni attempt logj breach unnam academ institut direct state see broader use particular vulner espionag actor viabil access method alreadi proven said param singh crowdstrik vice presid falcon overwatch email vmware first issu guidanc workaround differ horizon compon decemb lead overwatch investig client usag product vmware continu updat guidanc websit logj recent decemb attack aquat panda use modifi version logj exploit espionag group drew crowdstrik s attent attempt use linux bash command window host machin launch interact shell group attempt download crowdstrik belief revers shell encod three file vbs extens final group tri sever time harvest credenti dump memori window local secur author subsystem servic lsass singh note reason make logj attract use malici hacker may ultim make le attract widespread use espionag group mani secur vendor develop detect alert mechan exploit occur make use vulner le attract advanc threat actor said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'china', 'flaw', 'cyberwar', 'java']"
96,,Log4j Makes Waves In The US Financial Industry,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32942/Log4j-Makes-Waves-In-The-US-Financial-Industry.html,23/12/2021,"The recent Log4j vulnerability tests the security protocols of financial organizations in a way that the sector has not experienced in some time, exposing potential vulnerabilities both within their own networks as well as across the supply chain. Recently, SC Media published discussions with top banking executives at Texas Capital Bank and Finance of America, as well as cybersecurity vendor Cybereason. Many financial service institutions (FSIs) recognize the long term implications of the Log4j vulnerabilities, and the complexity of mitigating the threat. Gary McAlum, currently on the board of directors for TAG Cyber Group and a former longtime chief information security officer (CISO) for USAA, pointed out that like the SolarWinds hack of a year ago Log4j is “ubiquitous... it impacts everybody in some form or fashion, especially since open source is so commonly used.” “For the financial sector, it’s a particularly serious issue,” McAlum said. “And I wouldn’t say there’s room for over-confidence.” FSIs of all sizes should be implementing an incident response program to mitigate the potential impact of Log4j, keeping in mind that this cyber event could have ripple effects through third- fourth and fifth-party providers. “There is an environment of overlapping controls... which means that [IT security professionals] need to be methodical, and focus a lot of their attention here.” “The hardest thing is to work through complex supply chains,” McAlum said, adding that financial regulators will also be calling on FSIs as they are going through this, seeking updates and looking to potential exposure and mitigating actions. “The financial sector has responded well, quick and focused and understanding of the urgency of [Log4j]. Most of the time, when news like this hits, it’s not the first that FSIs are hearing about it,” he added. “They’re getting data from all sorts of sources about vulnerabilities.” “By the time it’s hitting CNN, the wheels are already turning for most FSIs,” McAlum said. Nick Santora, CEO of Curricula, an IT security awareness training service, pointed out that, “Log4j got a lot of attention, as this is the first time a vulnerability of this scale has been exposed. It’s the latest and greatest that impacts a lot of industries."" He added: “It’s another event that shows how unprepared most organizations are when an incident like Log4j happens.” Santora, who previously spent a decade working for the U.S. federal government in critical infrastructure protection, pointed out that, “Log4j affected a lot of legacy industries that rely on Java."" “The majority of organizations impacted were on legacy systems. This includes financial services, the energy sector, transportation — all categorized as critical infrastructure by CISA,” Santora said. “The ironic thing is when a patch was introduced for Log4j, it exposed another vulnerability. If you’re running a complex system, you can’t just throw a patch on like a Band-Aid, and you can’t turn the system off like you’re rebooting a machine.” So, what is a financial institution to do in the face of this kind of overwhelming cyber threat? “You need to have a planned maintenance process which includes analyzing the impacted systems, testing them in a non-production environment, then planning for an outage to roll out the patch. And if it all doesn’t go as planned, a way to roll it all back,” Santora said. “So when something like Log4j happens, most companies don’t have a plan on what to do. They have to turn off the service they’re providing to make sure they can patch it properly. This isn’t easy for legacy systems that are mission-critical and foundational for the organization.” Santora admitted that since critical infrastructure is not under one single compliance framework when it comes to the patch management process, formal incident response and patch management processes can be more complicated for FSIs. “Log4j is spread across an array of industries and some were not regulated for patch management and have never had to deal with something on this scale to turn off all of their systems to update it and fix the vulnerability,” Santora said, adding that incidents like Log4j underscore the need for FSIs to have incident response plans that take such events into account. “Building a community of trust among your vendors will be taken more seriously now because you want to know your software providers are doing the right things for cybersecurity. Cross contaminating amongst the community is a real problem,” Santora said. “We have to build trust in the private sector that we’re all doing the right thing.""",recent logj vulner test secur protocol financi organ way sector experienc time expos potenti vulner within network well across suppli chain recent sc medium publish discuss top bank execut texa capit bank financ america well cybersecur vendor cybereason mani financi servic institut fsis recogn long term implic logj vulner complex mitig threat gari mcalum current board director tag cyber group former longtim chief inform secur offic ciso usaa point like solarwind hack year ago logj ubiquit impact everybodi form fashion especi sinc open sourc common use financi sector particular serious issu mcalum said say room overconfid fsis size implement incid respons program mitig potenti impact logj keep mind cyber event could rippl effect third fourth fifthparti provid environ overlap control mean secur profession need method focus lot attent here hardest thing work complex suppli chain mcalum said ad financi regul also call fsis go seek updat look potenti exposur mitig action financi sector respond well quick focus understand urgenc logj time news like hit first fsis hear ad get data sort sourc vulner time hit cnn wheel alreadi turn fsis mcalum said nick santora ceo curriculum secur awar train servic point logj got lot attent first time vulner scale expos latest greatest impact lot industri ad anoth event show unprepar organ incid like logj happen santora previous spent decad work u feder govern critic infrastructur protect point logj affect lot legaci industri reli java major organ impact legaci system includ financi servic energi sector transport — categor critic infrastructur cisa santora said iron thing patch introduc logj expos anoth vulner run complex system throw patch like bandaid turn system like reboot machin financi institut face kind overwhelm cyber threat need plan mainten process includ analyz impact system test nonproduct environ plan outag roll patch go plan way roll back santora said someth like logj happen compani plan turn servic provid make sure patch proper easi legaci system missioncrit foundat organ santora admit sinc critic infrastructur one singl complianc framework come patch manag process formal incid respons patch manag process complic fsis logj spread across array industri regul patch manag never deal someth scale turn system updat fix vulner santora said ad incid like logj underscor need fsis incid respons plan take event account build communiti trust among vendor taken serious want know softwar provid right thing cybersecur cross contamin amongst communiti real problem santora said build trust privat sector right thing ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'bank', 'flaw', 'apache']"
97,,Evil Corp Is Dodging Sanctions By Dressing Up As REvil,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32933/Evil-Corp-Is-Dodging-Sanctions-By-Dressing-Up-As-REvil.html,21/12/2021,"The prolific ransomware group Evil Corp is sanctioned by the United States, creating legal and procedural barriers to pay their ransoms. Emsisoft believe the group is now identifying itself as a major competitor, REvil, to circumvent those sanctions. Michael Gillespie, the malware analyst with Emsisoft who first noted the deceptive approach on Twitter last week, told SC Media the methodology has been identified in a single attack so far. The REvil branding was promoted at several stages of the attack: encrypted files were given the "".revil"" extension, the ransomware note named ""revil.readme.txt."", the ransom site had a cartoonish ninja logo reading ""REvil,"" and the note itself mentioned being from REvil several times. (""Q: If I don't want to cooperate? A: Just google: Revil ransomware,"" reads the note.) But the malware was easily attributed to Evil Corp, said Gillespie. ""I compared the code to previous (unpacked) samples of PayloadBin and Hades samples, and the code perfectly overlaps all over the place,"" he said, adding that the file formats, use of cryptocurrency also matched up. Ignorance of a sanctioned group being behind a ransomware attack is not an excuse to make payments to groups on the Treasury Department's list of barred entities, known as the OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) list. Treasury sanctioned Evil Corp for ties to Russian espionage efforts. Allan Liska, a ransomware expert with Recorded Future, said researchers had seen Evil Corp use similar tactics in the past. ""The badass logo, no. But Evil Corp pretending to be other ransomware, yes,"" he said. Evil Corp has once before used an existing ransomware group for cover. In April, it played a similar trick claiming to be PayloadBin, the rebranded version of Babuk. Prior to that, Evil Corp had used several other aliases that were not established brands, including Phoenix, WastedLocker and Hades. REvil is an extremely prominent group to mimic. The original REvil was taken offline in October by hackers believed to be international military and law enforcement. But before then, REvil had supplied the malware used in the Kaseya and JBS attacks earlier in the year. Due to increased coverage of these instances, it is a name more casual followers of cybersecurity incidents are more likely to know. While the overwhelming consensus about Evil Corp's rapid name changes is that the group is trying to avoid sanctions, Brett Callow of Emsisoft said there might be one other explanation. ""Whether you consider this to be a play intended to confuse victims or to provide them with plausible deniability depends on your level of cynicism,"" he said Color the industry cynical.

98,,DHS Moves To Make Bug Bounties A Permanent Fixture,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32926/DHS-Moves-To-Make-Bug-Bounties-A-Permanent-Fixture.html,17/12/2021,"The Department of Homeland Security announced this week that it will make permanent a pilot bug bounty program it started in 2019, setting up a long-term channel between the department and the private security research community. The program will be conducted in three phases over the next year. DHS will start by inviting “vetted” cybersecurity researchers to perform virtual assessments of selected departmental systems, followed by a live, in-person hacking event where hackers can demonstrate their exploits and attacks. It will then review and evaluate the results in order to develop a model that can be repeated across other agencies in the federal government. This week, Secretary of Homeland Security Ali Mayorkas said in public comments that the program will pay researchers anywhere between $500 and $5,000, depending on the vulnerability’s severity and potential impact on departmental operations. In a statement announcing the program, he said DHS, which helps coordinate and manage cybersecurity issues across the civilian federal government, must “lead by example” and ensure their own systems are being proactively scrutinized for vulnerabilities. “The Hack DHS program incentivizes highly skilled hackers to identify cybersecurity weaknesses in our systems before they can be exploited by bad actors. This program is one example of how the department is partnering with the community to help protect our Nation’s cybersecurity,” he said. The new, permanent program will use an online platform developed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, while the department’s chief information officer will set ground rules for how outside hackers may engage with IT systems. The program is an outgrowth of a law originally passed in 2018 that established a limited pilot bug bounty program at DHS. It follows bug bounty initiatives set up by the Department of Defense, and last year the Office of Management and Budget and CISA issued marching orders to civilian agencies to begin setting up their own vulnerability disclosure programs, which do not pay out bounties but allow for similar engagement between agencies and outside security researchers around active vulnerabilities. In their memo to agencies, OMB officials indicated a preference for vulnerability disclosure programs, calling them “among the most effective methods for obtaining new insights regarding security vulnerability information.” They also warned agencies to do their due diligence before setting up a bounty program. “While several organizations in the Federal government have used bug bounty programs effectively, each agency should carefully weigh the cost, organizational competence, and maturity required for a strong and sustainable program,” the agency wrote last year. Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., chief sponsor of the Hack the Department of Homeland Security Act, celebrated the move. “The Department of Homeland Security is central to the safety and security of Granite Staters and Americans, and it is imperative that their online systems can withstand an attack,” Hassan said. “I am pleased that following the success of our bug bounty pilot program, the department has decided to make this program a permanent part of its cybersecurity strategy. While bug bounty programs can and often do discover real vulnerabilities in federal IT systems, they’re usually narrowly scoped and restrict researchers to prodding around a select number of public facing websites, databases and systems, as is the case with the DHS pilot. While agency officials argue that there are a myriad of potential risks from opening up more sensitive systems to third-party review, that also means large parts of an agency’s actual attack surface are essentially off-limits from outside scrutiny.",depart homeland secur announc week make perman pilot bug bounti program start set longterm channel depart privat secur research communiti program conduct three phase next year dhs start invit vet cybersecur research perform virtual assess select department system follow live inperson hack event hacker demonstr exploit attack review evalu result order develop model repeat across agenc feder govern week secretari homeland secur ali mayorka said public comment program pay research anywher depend vulner sever potenti impact department oper statement announc program said dhs help coordin manag cybersecur issu across civilian feder govern must lead exampl ensur system proactiv scrutin vulner hack dhs program incentiv high skill hacker identifi cybersecur weak system exploit bad actor program one exampl depart partner communiti help protect nation cybersecur said new perman program use onlin platform develop cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc depart chief inform offic set ground rule outsid hacker may engag system program outgrowth law origin pass establish limit pilot bug bounti program dhs follow bug bounti initi set depart defens last year offic manag budget cisa issu march order civilian agenc begin set vulner disclosur program pay bounti allow similar engag agenc outsid secur research around activ vulner memo agenc omb offici indic prefer vulner disclosur program call among effect method obtain new insight regard secur vulner inform also warn agenc due dilig set bounti program sever organ feder govern use bug bounti program effect agenc care weigh cost organiz compet matur requir strong sustain program agenc wrote last year sen maggi hassan dnh chief sponsor hack depart homeland secur act celebr move depart homeland secur central safeti secur granit stater american imper onlin system withstand attack hassan said pleas follow success bug bounti pilot program depart decid make program perman part cybersecur strategi bug bounti program often discov real vulner feder system usual narrowli scope restrict research prod around select number public face websit databas system case dhs pilot agenc offici argu myriad potenti risk open sensit system thirdparti review also mean larg part agenc actual attack surfac essenti offlimit outsid scrutini ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'usa', 'flaw']"
99,,Deepfakes Widen Fraud Opportunities For Financial Hackers,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32896/Deepfakes-Widen-Fraud-Opportunities-For-Financial-Hackers.html,"/12/9,","Cyber-thieves are learning to “fake it till they make it,” much to the chagrin of the financial service institutions who are falling prey to this latest spate of scams.  So-called “deepfakes” — where fraudsters use various technologies to skillfully mimic video, pictures or voices of other people — have captured popular attention, with deepfake videos emerging of celebrities and politicians being convincingly portrayed as doing and saying things they never have. Unlike hoaxes of the past, fraudsters are now utilizing more advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, to create deepfakes so realistic and seamless that it has become a real challenge for even the most skilled cybersecurity professional to spot the deception.  According to Nick Santora, CEO of security awareness training platform Curricula, while we’re only beginning to see the emergence of deepfakes in finance, “it’s not outlandish to think that it will be used in ways for cyberattacks that we’re not even expecting right now.” “The threat of voice and visual deep fakes will continue to increase as the tools for these hackers become more widely used and readily available, said Santora. “Today, there’s no technology readily available for smaller financial services institutions, as well as consumers, to help prevent them being duped from these scams."" While deepfakes have already been used for a host of nefarious purposes — from creating hoax pornographic videos to fake news and other misleading images and commentary — these fabrications are quickly becoming fodder for cyber-thieves looking to steal money and data from FSIs. Using AI, black-hat hackers earlier this year created a voice simulation of an executive at a prominent bank in the United Arab Emirates and, in combination with phony emails, convinced bank personnel to release $35 million to them. (Two of the accounts through which the stolen funds were funneled were actually with a U.S. bank; hence, U.S. FSIs and regulators are following this case quite keenly.)  Deepfakes are not a new development. Going back at least two years, skillful scammers have been using deepfakes — particularly in tandem with phishing, fake news and social media accounts and other fraud techniques — to perpetrate business email compromise. (In March 2019, cybercriminals were able to copy the voice of a U.K. energy company CEO to rip off nearly a quarter of a million dollars.) While AI and subsequently deepfake technology continues to improve, these scams are getting more difficult to spot, and the heists are getting larger, too.  “As deepfake accuracy improves and as the tools to make them get better, they could become a real problem in the future,” said Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist for KnowBe4, a security training firm. “People are pretty easy in general to socially engineer into doing the wrong thing.” Used in tandem with convincing phishing emails or duped phone numbers, these scams are quite persuasive. Where deepfakes can be more dangerous is when the authentication process is more automated and humans are taken out of the equation, said Andrew Howard, CEO of Kudelski Security. If an organization uses a vulnerable service for authentication, an attacker could use compromised facial recognition, for example, to carry out attack on multiple locations, said Howard. Including content about deepfakes in training and creating additional verifications steps of high-value transactions could aid in mitigating such attacks, he added. In January 2021, CyberCube, a cyber risk analytics firm tracking the insurance industry, released a report saying that due to exponential improvements in using AI to create realistic-looking video and audio fakes — and businesses’ growing dependence on using phone, email and video to connect internally and externally — deepfakes will be “a major cyber threat to businesses within the next two years.” New enhancements are continually being developed that make these digital fakes more plausible.  For example, developers at the University of Washington recently introduced a new technology called “mouth mapping,"" where the movement of the mouth is very accurately made to look as though the person is actually saying what the voice simulation has them saying, according to CyberCube.  “As the availability of personal information increases online, criminals are investing in technology to exploit this trend,"" said Darren Thomson, CyberCube’s head of cyber security strategy and the report author, in a prepared release. “New and emerging social engineering techniques like deepfake video and audio will fundamentally change the cyber threat landscape and are becoming both technically feasible and economically viable for criminal organizations of all sizes.” David Blaszkowsky, head of strategy and regulatory affairs for Helios Data, said deep fakes are really a “worst-case scenario, because nearly any protection dependent on visual or audio metrics can be cracked because they can be, in fact, perfect beyond any margin of error.”  “Fingerprints? Retinal scans? One by one, all the 'unique' metrics that protect access to data and accounts are being wiped out, like antibiotics against ever-mutating infectious diseases,” Blaszkowsky said. “It has always been easy to fool human gatekeepers, but with deepfakes it is easier than ever to fool the computers, too.” Thomson said it’s “only a matter of time before criminals apply the same technique to businesses and wealthy private individuals. It could be as simple as a faked voicemail from a senior manager instructing staff to make a fraudulent payment or move funds to an account set up by a hacker.” “There is no silver bullet that will translate into zero losses,” Thomson said. “Training employees to be prepared for deep fake attacks will also be important.”",cyberthiev learn fake till make much chagrin financi servic institut fall prey latest spate scam socal deepfak — fraudster use various technolog skill mimic video pictur voic peopl — captur popular attent deepfak video emerg celebr politician convinc portray say thing never unlik hoax past fraudster util advanc technolog includ artifici intellig creat deepfak realist seamless becom real challeng even skill cybersecur profession spot decept accord nick santora ceo secur awar train platform curriculum begin see emerg deepfak financ outlandish think use way cyberattack even expect right now threat voic visual deep fake continu increas tool hacker becom wide use readili avail said santora today technolog readili avail smaller financi servic institut well consum help prevent dupe scam deepfak alreadi use host nefari purpos — creat hoax pornograph video fake news mislead imag commentari — fabric quick becom fodder cyberthiev look steal money data fsis use ai blackhat hacker earlier year creat voic simul execut promin bank unit arab emir combin phoni email convinc bank personnel releas million two account stolen fund funnel actual u bank henc u fsis regul follow case quit keen deepfak new develop go back least two year skill scammer use deepfak — particular tandem phish fake news social medium account fraud techniqu — perpetr busi email compromis march cybercrimin abl copi voic uk energi compani ceo rip near quarter million dollar ai subsequ deepfak technolog continu improv scam get difficult spot heist get larger deepfak accuraci improv tool make get better could becom real problem futur said roger grime datadriven defens evangelist knowb secur train firm peopl pretti easi general social engin wrong thing use tandem convinc phish email dupe phone number scam quit persuas deepfak danger authent process autom human taken equat said andrew howard ceo kudelski secur organ us vulner servic authent attack could use compromis facial recognit exampl carri attack multipl locat said howard includ content deepfak train creat addit verif step highvalu transact could aid mitig attack ad januari cybercub cyber risk analyt firm track insur industri releas report say due exponenti improv use ai creat realisticlook video audio fake — busi grow depend use phone email video connect intern extern — deepfak major cyber threat busi within next two year new enhanc continu develop make digit fake plausibl exampl develop univers washington recent introduc new technolog call mouth map movement mouth accur made look though person actual say voic simul say accord cybercub avail person inform increas onlin crimin invest technolog exploit trend said darren thomson cybercub head cyber secur strategi report author prepar releas new emerg social engin techniqu like deepfak video audio fundament chang cyber threat landscap becom technic feasibl econom viabl crimin organ size david blaszkowski head strategi regulatori affair helio data said deep fake realli worstcas scenario near protect depend visual audio metric crack fact perfect beyond margin error fingerprint retin scan one one uniqu metric protect access data account wipe like antibiot evermut infecti diseas blaszkowski said alway easi fool human gatekeep deepfak easier ever fool comput too thomson said matter time crimin appli techniqu busi wealthi privat individu could simpl fake voicemail senior manag instruct staff make fraudul payment move fund account set hacker silver bullet translat zero loss thomson said train employe prepar deep fake attack also import ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'bank', 'password', 'science']"
100,,RTF Injection Poised For More Widespread Adoption,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32890/RTF-Injection-Poised-For-More-Widespread-Adoption.html,"/12/8,","Researchers expressed concern that cybercriminal actors will increasingly adopt RTF injection as a way to weaponize emailed documents, due to the technique’s accessibility and triviality compared to similar techniques. Via RTF injection, attackers can manipulate Rich Text Format files so that these files retrieve malicious content from an external URL, instead of from a legitimate file resource destination. This is possible because within the RTF file code are document formatting properties that can be easily changed via a hex editor, without the need of a word processor application, according to a recently published blog post report from Proofpoint. Moreover, Proofpoint found that the sample RTF template injection files it analyzed had a lower antivirus engine detection rate compared to a previously established Microsoft Office-based template injection technique. “Previous techniques largely relied on the use of embedded objects within the RTF file structure to deliver malicious payloads. That requires the compilation of a payload (or multiple stages of payloads and installers) which are then encoded and embedded within an RTF file… so the payload can be installed upon opening,” explained Sherrod DeGrippo, Proofpoint’s vice president of threat research and detection, in an interview with SC Media. But this new method “potentially removes the need for developer derived tools and places the power in the hands of operational phishing teams delivering malicious email campaigns.” There’s a big upside for attackers executing this tactic because “many organizations do not block RTF files by default,” she added. “They are part of the ordinary fabric of a business operations environment.” Proofpoint has identified three APT groups that in Q2 and Q3 of 2021 leveraged RTF injection for phishing campaigns, but the company’s researchers said they are “moderately confident” that we could soon see a significant uptick in activity featuring the same tactic, but perpetrated by less sophisticated, financially motivated actors. “RTF template injection is poised for wider adoption in the threat landscape including among cybercriminals based on its ease of use and relative effectiveness when compared with other phishing attachment template injection-based techniques,” wrote blog author Michael Raggi, senior threat researcher engineer. In fact, DeGrippo, told SC Media RTF template injection has already “been used before in a limited capacity by crimeware actors,” citing research from analyst Fareed Fauzi in January 2021 and an additional blog post from July 2021. “We often see new or updated techniques that are discovered by groups with more resources, [get] adopted by smaller groups or individuals once it’s known how to execute the particular attack type,” said Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions at Lookout. “With the number of documents we receive on a daily basis across email, collaboration platforms, networking apps and more, this tactic is also prime for social engineering.” Raggi’s report described the technique as follows: “RTF files include a ‘*template’ control word, where the value ‘*’ designates that the following value is a destination, and ‘template’ designates the specific control word function. This control word value is intended to be the destination of a legitimate template file which is retrieved and loaded upon the opening of the initial RTF, changing the visual appearance of the file. However, it is trivial to alter the bytes of an existing RTF file to insert a template control word destination including a URL resource. This allows the RTF file to retrieve a URL resource as a destination rather than a file like the RTF structure intends. This method is viable in both .rtf and .doc.rtf files, allowing for the successful retrieval of remote payloads hosted at an external URL.” Depending on the format of the weaponized file, victims at certain points see some combination of a decoy document, a “contacting the server message” and/or an error message. “Successfully executing this attack could deliver malware into the organization's infrastructure,” said Schless. “Aside from infecting the infrastructure, this could also lead to creation of a backdoor into the organization. This would enable the attacker to enter the infrastructure undetected and move laterally in search of valuable data or observe the organization’s behaviors and security protections to eventually carry out an advanced cyberattack. “ According to Proofpoint, the technique has been already used by the reputed Indian ATP group DoNot Team, a Chinese-related APT actor and suspected Russian APT actor Gamaredon. “The viability of XML Office based remote template documents has proven that this type of delivery mechanism is a durable and effective method when paired with phishing as an initial delivery vector,” Raggi wrote. “The innovation by threat actors to bring this method to a new file type in RTFs represents an expanding surface area of threat for organizations worldwide.” As for how can organizations best protect themselves and their employees against this particular phishing threat, detection will be key. For that, DeGrippo recommended “to scan incoming RTF files with some sort of signature type like Yara or Clam AV for the RTF template control group including a URL or Unicode bytes comprising an encoded URL.” (Proofpoint lists some signatures in its blog post.) “RTFs like mentioned in the blog have their file properties in plaintext so detecting this type of technique in an organization’s traffic should be relatively easy if conducting file scanning at the email gateway or on the host,” DeGrippo continued. “However, it's important to keep in mind that legitimate RTF files may use the RTF template control word to redirect to legitimate template files, not URLs.” Sean Nikkel, senior cyber threat Intel Analyst at Digital Shadows, added that users “should become aware of the risks of opening documents that require downloads of templates or other data from the internet, especially from unknown users. Organizations may want to consider restricting the use of certain file types, such as RTF, in case security tools don't catch suspicious signatures or behaviors that would be a giveaway for attacks like these. An even more restrictive security stance might involve stripping inbound emails of attachments or using a sandbox to test them for malicious activity.” The onus falls largely on email recipients and their organizations because, unfortunately, there’s not much chance that the RTF format is revised and better secured against manipulation.  “The fundamentals of the RTF file type, including destination control words and the 16-bit Unicode characters used by actors have been ‘baked in’ so to speak since RTF v 1.5 in April of 1997,” explained DeGrippo. “Microsoft discontinued development on RTF in 2008; however, it continues to be supported by applications in almost every operating system. So while the RTF file format could possibly be fundamentally reimagined, the likelihood of a file type not under active development being updated for security reasons is unlikely.”",research express concern cybercrimin actor increas adopt rtf inject way weapon email document due techniqu access trivial compar similar techniqu via rtf inject attack manipul rich text format file file retriev malici content extern url instead legitim file resourc destin possibl within rtf file code document format properti easili chang via hex editor without need word processor applic accord recent publish blog post report proofpoint moreov proofpoint found sampl rtf templat inject file analyz lower antivirus engin detect rate compar previous establish microsoft officebas templat inject techniqu previous techniqu larg reli use embed object within rtf file structur deliv malici payload requir compil payload multipl stage payload instal encod embed within rtf file… payload instal upon open explain sherrod degrippo proofpoint vice presid threat research detect interview sc medium new method potenti remov need develop deriv tool place power hand oper phish team deliv malici email campaign big upsid attack execut tactic mani organ block rtf file default ad part ordinari fabric busi oper environ proofpoint identifi three apt group q q leverag rtf inject phish campaign compani research said moder confid could soon see signific uptick activ featur tactic perpetr le sophist financi motiv actor rtf templat inject pois wider adopt threat landscap includ among cybercrimin base eas use relat effect compar phish attach templat injectionbas techniqu wrote blog author michael raggi senior threat research engin fact degrippo told sc medium rtf templat inject alreadi use limit capac crimewar actor cite research analyst fare fauzi januari addit blog post juli often see new updat techniqu discov group resourc get adopt smaller group individu known execut particular attack type said hank schless senior manag secur solut lookout number document receiv daili basi across email collabor platform network app tactic also prime social engin raggi report describ techniqu follow rtf file includ ‘ templat control word valu ‘ design follow valu destin ‘ templat design specif control word function control word valu intend destin legitim templat file retriev load upon open initi rtf chang visual appear file howev trivial alter byte exist rtf file insert templat control word destin includ url resourc allow rtf file retriev url resourc destin rather file like rtf structur intend method viabl rtf docrtf file allow success retriev remot payload host extern url depend format weapon file victim certain point see combin decoy document contact server messag andor error messag success execut attack could deliv malwar organ s infrastructur said schless asid infect infrastructur could also lead creation backdoor organ would enabl attack enter infrastructur undetect move later search valuabl data observ organ behavior secur protect eventu carri advanc cyberattack accord proofpoint techniqu alreadi use reput indian atp group donot team chineserel apt actor suspect russian apt actor gamaredon viabil xml offic base remot templat document proven type deliveri mechan durabl effect method pair phish initi deliveri vector raggi wrote innov threat actor bring method new file type rtfs repres expand surfac area threat organ worldwid organ best protect employe particular phish threat detect key degrippo recommend scan incom rtf file sort signatur type like yara clam av rtf templat control group includ url unicod byte compris encod url proofpoint list signatur blog post rtfs like mention blog file properti plaintext detect type techniqu organ traffic relat easi conduct file scan email gateway host degrippo continu howev s import keep mind legitim rtf file may use rtf templat control word redirect legitim templat file url sean nikkel senior cyber threat intel analyst digit shadow ad user becom awar risk open document requir download templat data internet especi unknown user organ may want consid restrict use certain file type rtf case secur tool nt catch suspici signatur behavior would giveaway attack like even restrict secur stanc might involv strip inbound email attach use sandbox test malici activ onus fall larg email recipi organ unfortun much chanc rtf format revis better secur manipul fundament rtf file type includ destin control word bit unicod charact use actor ‘ bake speak sinc rtf v april explain degrippo microsoft discontinu develop rtf howev continu support applic almost everi oper system rtf file format could possibl fundament reimagin likelihood file type activ develop updat secur reason unlik ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'malware', 'flaw']"

""Microsoft’s [Digital Crimes Unit] has been a pioneer in using this legal strategy against cybercriminals and, more recently, against nation-state hackers,"" wrote Tom Burt, corporate vice president for customer security and trust, in a Microsoft blog post celebrating the move. ""To date, in 24 lawsuits — five against nation-state actors — we’ve taken down more than 10,000 malicious websites used by cybercriminals and nearly 600 sites used by nation-state actors. We have also successfully blocked the registration of 600,000 sites to get ahead of criminal actors that planned to use them maliciously in the future."" APT15, which Microsoft nicknames Nickel, is believed to be a Chinese espionage group. Microsoft has been using the courts to seize infrastructure since 2016, when it won domains used by the Russian group Fancy Bear. Microsoft commonly wins these actions by default judgment since no one shows to defend the malicious use of domains. In the Nickel case, Microsoft won the default judgment on Oct. 21, according to court records. The case was heard in the Eastern District of Virginia, home to Verisign, which oversees the .com and .org top-level domains used by the group. According to the court documents, Microsoft found a series of features unique to domains used by the group and used that to discover as many domains as possible. Nickel's most recent flurry of activity involved exploiting unpatched Sharepoint, Exchange Servers and Pulse VPN, ultimately exfiltrating data and harvesting email credentials. Microsoft issued a separate blog outlining its latest observed attacks. Microsoft used its announcement of the lawsuit to lobby for the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, a joint effort from private industry and many nations to set norms for espionage and nation-state cyber actions. The U.S. had declined to sign the Paris Call at its inception in 2018, but Vice President Kamala Harris recently signaled the U.S. was changing course. ""No individual action from Microsoft or anyone else in the industry will stem the tide of attacks we’ve seen from nation-states and cybercriminals working within their borders.

The protection package includes streamlined two-factor authentication with increased customer support and increased monitoring for hackers.  “Two-factor authentication — particularly by using third-party authentication apps —significantly improves the security of your online accounts. Right now, anyone can enroll in two-factor authentication and everyone should,” wrote Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy in a blog post connected to the announcement.  “However, this important feature has been historically underutilized across the internet — even by people that are more likely to be targeted by malicious hackers, such as journalists, activists, political candidates and others.” Facebook is not mandating any action of anyone unless they are contacted to enroll. The social media outlet does not anticipate the mandate will have a large impact on participation on the site. Gleicher wrote that in a limited test of mandating Facebook Protect while offering simplified two-factor enrollment and increased customer support, Facebook found that  over 90% of users chose to enroll.  “Over the next several months, we’re going to carefully expand this requirement globally. We’re encouraged by our early findings and will continue to improve Facebook Protect over time,” he wrote. Facebook Protect was first implemented during the 2018 U.S. presidential campaign.

103,,Credentials Exposed For Majority Of US Financial Firms,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32856/Credentials-Exposed-For-Majority-Of-US-Financial-Firms.html,27/11/2021,"Financial service institutions have already come around to the idea that breaches may not possibly happen, but probably will happen.  However, a report released last Thursday by digital threat intelligence company Constella Intelligence found that as bad as that sounds, the reality may be even worse. Indeed, the report, which examined financial industry-specific data from January 2018 through September 2021 discovered that the majority of employees from the Fortune 500 financial firms have had their corporate credentials exposed, making for a huge potential for impactful breaches.   ""This report should be a wake-up call for every bank, insurance company, stock brokerage, credit card company, and financial institution that they are attractive and viable targets for cyber threat actors,"" said Constella Intelligence CEO Kailash Ambwani in a statement. ""Companies and individuals must take new precautions to protect themselves from threats with high potential to target employees as a vector to inflict reputational and financial harm."" While most major enterprises, including financial service institutions (FSIs), have come around to the idea that serious breaches are not a matter of “if, but when,” this research points up how much access bad actors really have to sensitive financial information. The report, ""Financial Services Sector Exposure Report: 2018-2021 Findings and Trends,"" reviewed records from data breaches found in “open sources, and on the surface, deep, and dark web.” Constella Intelligence's threat intelligence team identified 6,472 breaches or leakages, and more than 3.3 million exposed records where financial employee corporate credentials were involved.  According to Jonathan Nelson, digital intelligence specialist at Constella Intelligence, and one of the principal authors of the report, “Almost everyone's PII exists online somewhere — whether on open sources, social media, or the surface, deep, or dark web. Companies seeking to safeguard their people, assets, and brand can proactively monitor the digital sphere for exposed credentials that enable threat actors to launch many of the high-profile attacks that we are seeing today.” Even more disturbing, two-third of these internal financial industry breaches involved personal identifiable information (PII) — all of which included email addresses and 72% included private passwords. Seven out of 10 executives profiled in the report have already had their corporate credentials leaked or compromised in some way. Further, according to the report: “The proliferation and circulation of this sensitive employee data enables threat actors with the necessary resources to execute a wide range of cyberattacks, including ransomware, impersonation, phishing, account takeover, and several others.” Companies and general corporate cultures have come around to the understanding that breaches will happen, “but what’s important are the types of breaches we’re talking about here,” Nelson said. “Employees and humans are the weakest points in terms of an organization’s cybersecurity posture and our findings related to the vast number of exposures in circulation are a serious cause for concern,” said Nelson. “These exposed credentials are the keys for threat actors to access companies’ sensitive data and critical systems.” And nearly all of these executives (98%) say they have been exposed in breaches that include PII, and 2 out of 5 even say their private passwords were found and exploited. So what can FSIs do to mitigate the risk from these threats?

Zelle is partnered with dozens of banks and credit unions. The most recent attack was based off a phishing scam with a spoofed text message from the target’s bank warning about a suspicious Zelle transfer. The bad actors then sent out text messages about suspicious bank transfers as a pretext to get unsuspecting people to call back or respond by text. “Despite widespread publicity of the scams involving the Zelle money transfer service, hackers continue to use social engineering to break into accounts. While the results aren’t in the range of the millions of dollars that ransomware attackers are demanding, individual losses can easily be in the thousands, said Saryu Nayyar, CEO of Gurucal. “Hackers are calling Zelle users, posing as representatives of Zelle or the underlying bank, and tricking them out of providing the user name of their account. With the user name, they change the password in real time, giving them the data necessary to hack the account.” Bill Lawrence, chief information security officer for SecurityGate, noted that, “This common example of social engineering implemented by savvy actors is a time-tested tactic. What I find interesting is when this approach is aimed at operational teams in traditionally 'air gapped' critical infrastructure environments."" According to an interview with cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs, Ken Otsuka, senior risk consultant at CUNA Mutual Group, an insurance company that provides financial services to credit unions, said a phone fraudster typically will say something like, “Before I get into the details, I need to verify that I’m speaking to the right person. What’s your username?” “In the background, they’re using the username with the forgot password feature, and that’s going to generate one of these two-factor authentication passcodes,” Otsuka said. “Then the fraudster will say, ‘I’m going to send you the password and you’re going to read it back to me over the phone.'” Per Krebs: An important aspect of this scam is that the fraudsters never even need to know or phish the victim’s password. By sharing their username and reading back the one-time code sent to them via email, the victim is allowing the fraudster to reset their online banking password. Otsuka said in far too many account takeover cases, the victim has never even heard of Zelle, nor did they realize they could move money that way. “The thing is, many credit unions offer it by default as part of online banking,” Otsuka said to Krebs. “Members don’t have to request to use Zelle. It’s just there, and with a lot of members targeted in these scams, although they’d legitimately enrolled in online banking, they’d never used Zelle before.”",last week popular peertop payment pp servic zell experienc hit cybercrimin drain fund account zell partner dozen bank credit union recent attack base phish scam spoof text messag target bank warn suspici zell transfer bad actor sent text messag suspici bank transfer pretext get unsuspect peopl call back respond text despit widespread public scam involv zell money transfer servic hacker continu use social engin break account result rang million dollar ransomwar attack demand individu loss easili thousand said saryu nayyar ceo guruc hacker call zell user pose repres zell under bank trick provid user name account user name chang password real time give data necessari hack account bill lawrenc chief inform secur offic securityg note common exampl social engin implement savvi actor timetest tactic find interest approach aim oper team tradit air gap critic infrastructur environ accord interview cybersecur expert brian kreb ken otsuka senior risk consult cuna mutual group insur compani provid financi servic credit union said phone fraudster typic say someth like get detail need verifi speak right person usernam background use usernam forgot password featur go generat one twofactor authent passcod otsuka said fraudster say ‘ go send password go read back phone per kreb import aspect scam fraudster never even need know phish victim password share usernam read back onetim code sent via email victim allow fraudster reset onlin bank password otsuka said far mani account takeov case victim never even heard zell realiz could move money way thing mani credit union offer default part onlin bank otsuka said kreb member request use zell lot member target scam although legitim enrol onlin bank never use zell ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'email', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'phish']"

Paller was 76. Paller co-founded the cybersecurity training group SANS in 1988, where he would also serve as research director. In 2004 he spearheaded SANS's creation of a formal undergraduate and graduate school, the SANS Technology Institute. Paller was a director of CyberStart America, board member of the Center for Institute Security, and director of the National Cyber Scholarship Foundation. He formerly co-chaired advisory committees for the FCC and Department of Homeland Security, and served on former-President Clinton's National Infrastructure Assurance Council. Paller earned the Azimuth Award in 2005. ""It's impossible to imagine the industry as it is today without the contributions of Alan,"" said SANS chief technology officer James Lyne. ""Not only the direct contributions of Alan, where he has helped policy-started initiatives and catering to industry, but he's also responsible for so many giants on whose shoulders many people stood on. Tens of thousands of practitioners that really matter to people have gone on to really important political stations that change the standard of cyber hygiene and government are because of him."" Lyne said he first met Paller at a U.K. government event on creating cyber workforce, in a flurry of the relentless energy Paller's peers remember him for. ""He trapped me in a corner and asked questions, came up with ideas, and just approach the problem with just an infectious energy and desire to solve a problem that you knew would make a difference to the world,"" said Lyne.

106,,Senate Panel Passes Slew Of Cybersecurity Bills,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32789/Senate-Panel-Passes-Slew-Of-Cybersecurity-Bills.html,"/11/4,","The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passed a slew of cybersecurity related legislation Wednesday, including bills that would put new cybersecurity guardrails around government artificial intelligence programs, bolster the federal cybersecurity workforce, implement a number of recommendations from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission on securing critical infrastructure, establish a national cyber exercise program to game out incident response capabilities and codify one of the government’s primary cloud security certification programs. One of the most significant was the Defense of United States Infrastructure Act, which would implement a number of recommendations from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. The legislation would develop a national strategy to protect critical infrastructure from cyber and physical attacks, establish grant programs to increase resiliency of critical infrastructure, give the National Cyber Director new hiring authorities and create a Bureau of Cybersecurity Statistics to track data around incidents and defense. It would also push through a number of changes at CISA, creating a cloud-based joint information sharing environment focused on malware forensics and threat intelligence, codifying a five-year term for CISA’s director and empowering the agency to classify “systemically important” critical infrastructure to prioritize federal resources. The Good AI Act, introduced by HSGAC Chair Gary Peters, D-Mich., and ranking Republican Rob Portman, R-Ohio, would compel the director of the Office of Management and Budget to form an “Artificial Intelligence Hygiene Working Group” that would focus on updating federal contracting standards for AI projects and incorporate the latest research on best practices. The group would be given a specific mandate to align future contracting language with the AI in Government Act, which mandated the creation of an AI Center of Excellence at the General Services Administration and directed OMB to develop guidance to federal agencies on current and future projects. “Artificial intelligence applications that can be used to strengthen our national security collect a considerable amount of sensitive data. It’s critical that we protect and secure this data to safeguard the rights and privacy of the American people,” said Peters in a statement. “This bipartisan bill will ensure that federal contractors cannot misuse the information collected by these technologies and that artificial intelligence is used appropriately for the benefit of our nation.”  Another bill, the Federal Cybersecurity Workforce Expansion Act introduced by Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, would create a new apprenticeship program at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, as well as a pilot cyber training program for military veterans transitioning to civilian life. The apprenticeship program must focus on cybersecurity competencies deemed relevant by CISA and provide a direct pathway to eventual employment at the agency, a grant award or a private sector role that the CISA director has certified is contributing to national cybersecurity in the United States. If passed, it would represent another tool for CISA to bolster its ranks with badly needed cybersecurity talent. The agency recently partnered with Girls Who Code to develop career pathways for young Black female professionals and a new hiring system that allows them to sidestep the laborious federal hiring process and pay higher salaries to cybersecurity job candidates is set to go live Nov. 15. During a committee markup of the bill Wednesday, an amendment proposed by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., to change federal law governing to allow agencies to use direct hiring authorities from when there is a shortage of “highly qualified” candidates was rejected on a party-line vote. Lankford said the change was needed to allow agencies more flexibility in the hiring process. “Obviously there may be candidates available but any of you who work in the IT area … there’s a difference between candidates and highly qualified candidates,” said Lankford. Both Peters and Hassan voted against the measure. Hassan said she was concerned that the change in language could create unintended consequences, while Peters said it could allow agencies to sidestep normal hiring rules or install political loyalists. “Although I agree there are circumstances in which agencies should have direct hiring option, this approach needs to be used carefully to protect the merit system protections, fairness in the federal hiring process and an apolitical, professional civil service,” Peters said.",senat homeland secur government affair committe pass slew cybersecur relat legisl wednesday includ bill would put new cybersecur guardrail around govern artifici intellig program bolster feder cybersecur workforc implement number recommend cyberspac solarium commiss secur critic infrastructur establish nation cyber exercis program game incid respons capabl codifi one govern primari cloud secur certif program one signific defens unit state infrastructur act would implement number recommend cyberspac solarium commiss legisl would develop nation strategi protect critic infrastructur cyber physic attack establish grant program increas resili critic infrastructur give nation cyber director new hire author creat bureau cybersecur statist track data around incid defens would also push number chang cisa creat cloudbas joint inform share environ focus malwar forens threat intellig codifi fiveyear term cisa director empow agenc classifi system import critic infrastructur priorit feder resourc good ai act introduc hsgac chair gari peter dmich rank republican rob portman rohio would compel director offic manag budget form artifici intellig hygien work group would focus updat feder contract standard ai project incorpor latest research best practic group would given specif mandat align futur contract languag ai govern act mandat creation ai center excel general servic administr direct omb develop guidanc feder agenc current futur project artifici intellig applic use strengthen nation secur collect consider amount sensit data critic protect secur data safeguard right privaci american peopl said peter statement bipartisan bill ensur feder contractor misus inform collect technolog artifici intellig use appropri benefit nation anoth bill feder cybersecur workforc expans act introduc sen maggi hassan dnh john cornyn rtexa would creat new apprenticeship program cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc well pilot cyber train program militari veteran transit civilian life apprenticeship program must focus cybersecur compet deem relev cisa provid direct pathway eventu employ agenc grant award privat sector role cisa director certifi contribut nation cybersecur unit state pass would repres anoth tool cisa bolster rank bad need cybersecur talent agenc recent partner girl code develop career pathway young black femal profession new hire system allow sidestep labori feder hire process pay higher salari cybersecur job candid set go live nov committe markup bill wednesday amend propos sen jame lankford rokla chang feder law govern allow agenc use direct hire author shortag high qualifi candid reject partylin vote lankford said chang need allow agenc flexibl hire process obvious may candid avail work area … differ candid high qualifi candid said lankford peter hassan vote measur hassan said concern chang languag could creat unintend consequ peter said could allow agenc sidestep normal hire rule instal polit loyalist although agre circumst agenc direct hire option approach need use care protect merit system protect fair feder hire process apolit profession civil servic peter said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa']"
107,,"New Federal Order Narrows Agency Patching Focus To Known, Exploited Vulnerabilities",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32782/New-Federal-Order-Narrows-Agency-Patching-Focus-To-Known-Exploited-Vulnerabilities.html,"/11/3,","The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has issued a cybersecurity order that compels civilian federal agencies to ensure they aren’t vulnerable to previously exploited software and hardware bugs. In a new binding operational directive, the agency put forward a list of nearly 300 known and exploited vulnerabilities that “carry significant risk to the federal enterprise."" The order gives agencies a timeline of six months to patch if the vulnerability was reported prior to 2021. For all the others, they have two weeks. “Every day, our adversaries are using known vulnerabilities to target federal agencies. As the operational lead for federal cybersecurity, we are using our directive authority to drive cybersecurity efforts toward mitigation of those specific vulnerabilities that we know to be actively used by malicious cyber actors,” CISA Director Jen Easterly said in a statement. The order comes with a number of other timelines. Federal civilian agencies have two months to update their vulnerability management procedures to align with the new directive, assign roles to staff, identify action items, establish validation procedures and set internal tracking and reporting requirements. They must also provide CISA with regular updates on the patching through the federal Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation dashboard and send quarterly reports through an online tool called CyberScope. CISA, for its part, will maintain and update the catalog with new vulnerabilities and develop annual reports for the National Cyber Director and the Office of Management and Budget. and the agency said this new directive would compliment – but not replace – a directive issued in 2019 that was focused on patching critical vulnerabilities in a timely fashion. Vulnerability management was at the heart of the first-ever binding operational directive issued by CISA, and it has been a perpetual focus for the agency since its inception. It reflects the reality that most compromises of government and private networks are facilitated in part by or in whole by known or reported bugs that could have been closed off with better patching practices. Both the U.S. government and private threat intelligence firms have highlighted how threat actors have increasingly moved to weaponize newly discovered vulnerabilities, in order to take advantage of the lag time it usually takes for a certain percentage of organizations to patch. This was an issue during exploitation of the Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerabilities, for example. It also reflects the need to focus the attention of overstretched IT security staff in the midst of what can seem like an endless deluge of reported software and hardware vulnerabilities. According to a fact sheet provided by CISA, there were more than 18,000 reported CVEs in 2020, of which more than 10,000 – or 28 a day – were categorized critical or high severity. By prioritizing the nearly 300 flaws that cybersecurity officials know have been used or leveraged against the federal government, it could offer agencies a roadmap to significantly reducing their exposure to known, successful hacks. Easterly also made it clear that the agency believes many of the same vulnerabilities listed in the catalog are also being used against targets in the private sector. “While this Directive applies to federal civilian agencies, we know that organizations across the country, including critical infrastructure entities, are targeted using these same vulnerabilities. It is therefore critical that every organization adopt this Directive and prioritize mitigation of vulnerabilities listed in CISA’s public catalog,” she said.",cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc issu cybersecur order compel civilian feder agenc ensur vulner previous exploit softwar hardwar bug new bind oper direct agenc put forward list near known exploit vulner carri signific risk feder enterpris order give agenc timelin six month patch vulner report prior other two week everi day adversari use known vulner target feder agenc oper lead feder cybersecur use direct author drive cybersecur effort toward mitig specif vulner know activ use malici cyber actor cisa director jen easter said statement order come number timelin feder civilian agenc two month updat vulner manag procedur align new direct assign role staff identifi action item establish valid procedur set intern track report requir must also provid cisa regular updat patch feder continu diagnost mitig dashboard send quarter report onlin tool call cyberscop cisa part maintain updat catalog new vulner develop annual report nation cyber director offic manag budget agenc said new direct would compliment – replac – direct issu focus patch critic vulner time fashion vulner manag heart firstev bind oper direct issu cisa perpetu focus agenc sinc incept reflect realiti compromis govern privat network facilit part whole known report bug could close better patch practic u govern privat threat intellig firm highlight threat actor increas move weapon newli discov vulner order take advantag lag time usual take certain percentag organ patch issu exploit microsoft exchang server vulner exampl also reflect need focus attent overstretch secur staff midst seem like endless delug report softwar hardwar vulner accord fact sheet provid cisa report cf – day – categor critic high sever priorit near flaw cybersecur offici know use leverag feder govern could offer agenc roadmap signific reduc exposur known success hack easter also made clear agenc belief mani vulner list catalog also use target privat sector direct appli feder civilian agenc know organ across countri includ critic infrastructur entiti target use vulner therefor critic everi organ adopt direct priorit mitig vulner list cisa public catalog said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'flaw', 'patch']"
108,,"As Fewer Victims Pay Ransoms, Conti Gang Looks To Sell Victim Data",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32760/As-Fewer-Victims-Pay-Ransoms-Conti-Gang-Looks-To-Sell-Victim-Data.html,27/10/2021,"Conti is changing its business model. Rather than post leak data as a threat, Conti is now offering stolen data from victims who have not paid ransoms for sale to outside buyers. It may be the next evolution for ransomware gangs left with boatloads of unmonetized data after victims have become dramatically less likely to pay ransoms over just the past quarter. ""In general, we're just seeing fewer people pay,"" said Allan Liska, a ransomware expert with Recorded Future. ""And so whenever that happens, the ransomware actors sort of try and launch new ventures as far as 'how else can we coerce money out of people or monetize the data that was stolen.'"" Conti's leak site is now checkered with offers to purchase data where leaks once would have been. That includes an American HVAC supplier, a European pharmaceutical and other firms. While the total dollar amount of ransoms has risen, the percentage of victims infected with ransomware paying those ransoms has declined. The law firm BakerHostetler, which has a significant cyber practice and tracks client trends, has seen a dramatic decline in the number of its clients paying ransoms. ""In 2018 and 2019, over 50 percent [of our victimized clients paid a ransom],"" said Ted Kobus, a BakerHostetler partner. ""Last year, we averaged below 50 percent. This year, we're averaging below 30 percent."" There may be a number of factors in play for the decline. In fact, with traditional extortion schemes, there would have to be. Ransomware operators often pursue multiple threats during an attack; they will encrypt files and threaten to leak data. A decline in paying means neither threat was threatening. On the network end, better preparation could be a factor. The insurer Corvus, for example, believes that is a key reason for a dramatic drop in the number of victimized clients paying any amount of ransom. Corvus takes an active role in ensuring clients have usable offsite backups, which it credits for the lower-than-average need to pay ransom to start with. But improving client backups appears to have further improved results. According to a report released last week, between the second and third quarter of 2021, victimized clients paying ransoms dropped by half, from 24 percent of clients to 12 percent. ""What I get most excited about is we're starting to see that curve happen where the numbers are catching up to organizations who are investing in a more resilient solution to ensure that they can keep pace with the evolving threat landscape,"" said Jason Rebholz, CISO of Corvus. At the same time, said Liska and Kobus, ransomware actors may not be doing as good of a job getting to the most damaging data on a network. That could result from better network segmentation or the inexperience of new actors in the threat space. The latter may be manifesting in other ways, too, including failures in the exfiltration process. While leak posts are up, said Liska, they are not as far up as he would expect given the increase in attacks and decrease in payments. That could be the result of not getting the best files or it could be bureaucratic delays on the part of actors — a backlog of data being prepped for leaks (Liska said it can take some operators months) or hesitancy to leak files during negotiations. Conti is working unposted files and offers to sell data into its extortion pitch. A text box on the top of their page now warns victims who have not paid the ransom and do not see their data on the site ""this does not mean that we forgot about you, it only means that data was sold and only therefore it did not publish in free access!""",conti chang busi model rather post leak data threat conti offer stolen data victim paid ransom sale outsid buyer may next evolut ransomwar gang left boatload unmonet data victim becom dramat le like pay ransom past quarter general re see fewer peopl pay said allan liska ransomwar expert record futur whenev happen ransomwar actor sort tri launch new ventur far how els coerc money peopl monet data stolen conti s leak site checker offer purchas data leak would includ american hvac supplier european pharmaceut firm total dollar amount ransom risen percentag victim infect ransomwar pay ransom declin law firm bakerhostetl signific cyber practic track client trend seen dramat declin number client pay ransom percent victim client paid ransom said ted kobus bakerhostetl partner last year averag percent year re averag percent may number factor play declin fact tradit extort scheme would ransomwar oper often pursu multipl threat attack encrypt file threaten leak data declin pay mean neither threat threaten network end better prepar could factor insur corvus exampl belief key reason dramat drop number victim client pay amount ransom corvus take activ role ensur client usabl offsit backup credit lowerthanaverag need pay ransom start improv client backup appear improv result accord report releas last week second third quarter victim client pay ransom drop half percent client percent get excit re start see curv happen number catch organ invest resili solut ensur keep pace evolv threat landscap said jason rebholz ciso corvus time said liska kobus ransomwar actor may good job get damag data network could result better network segment inexperi new actor threat space latter may manifest way includ failur exfiltr process leak post said liska far would expect given increas attack decreas payment could result get best file could bureaucrat delay part actor — backlog data prep leak liska said take oper month hesit leak file negoti conti work unpost file offer sell data extort pitch text box top page warn victim paid ransom see data site mean forgot mean data sold therefor publish free access ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'malware', 'cybercrime', 'data loss', 'fraud', 'cryptography']"
109,,BlackMatter Botched Millions In Ransoms Due To Coding Flaw,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32759/BlackMatter-Botched-Millions-In-Ransoms-Due-To-Coding-Flaw.html,26/10/2021,"Until a recent update to the BlackMatter ransomware platform fixed a coding bug, cybersecurity firm Emsisoft was able to help a wide number of victims recover data without paying. ""With the help of law enforcement agencies, CERTs and private sector partners in multiple countries, we were able to reach numerous victims, helping them avoid tens of millions of dollars in demands,"" Fabian Wosar, Emsisoft chief technology officer, wrote in a blog on Sunday. Emsisoft had been doing the recoveries without publically announcing the vulnerability they had exploited as not to alert the ransomware gang to the costly error. Emsisoft came forward after BlackMatter caught their mistake and patched it. BlackMatter is the continuation of the Dark Side malware famously used in the Colonial Pipeline attack. Dark Side changed names due to the global law enforcement attention brought by the attack, pulling up stakes quickly enough to leave the affiliates who licensed use of Dark Side ransomware in their criminal hacking campaigns in the lurch. While security experts are convinced BlackMatter is Dark Side, the affiliates have been willing to see the groups as distinct enough not to fear similar abandonment. The connection between the groups led Emsisoft to discover the vulnerability it would use to recover files for victims. Dark Side patched a vulnerability in January that Emsisoft was using to recover files. As BlackMatter, which launched over the summer, tinkered with the platform, it accidentally reopened that vulnerability. But all good things come to an end. According to Emsisoft's blog, BlackMatter recently hardened its platform after the group's detractors started to exploit a glitch in the communications system that allowed anyone to enter negotiations and communicate as the victim. Though it was not mentioned by name, this appears to be a reference to the New Cooperative ransomware negotiations, where someone — allegedly not the victim — posted a timeless response to an accusation the Cooperative had violated ransomware rules by contacting the police. Hardening the platform removed the vulnerability Emsisoft discovered, according to the blog, and the company felt that it could now come forward with what it had been able to do without interrupting its ability to do it. Wosar said Emsisoft has similar unpublicized capabilities with other ransomware services. ""Beyond BlackMatter, our team has identified vulnerabilities in about a dozen active ransomware families. In these cases, we can recover the vast majority of victims’ encrypted data without a ransom payment,"" he said.",recent updat blackmatt ransomwar platform fix code bug cybersecur firm emsisoft abl help wide number victim recov data without pay help law enforc agenc cert privat sector partner multipl countri abl reach numer victim help avoid ten million dollar demand fabian wosar emsisoft chief technolog offic wrote blog sunday emsisoft recoveri without public announc vulner exploit alert ransomwar gang cost error emsisoft came forward blackmatt caught mistak patch blackmatt continu dark side malwar famous use coloni pipelin attack dark side chang name due global law enforc attent brought attack pull stake quick enough leav affili licens use dark side ransomwar crimin hack campaign lurch secur expert convinc blackmatt dark side affili will see group distinct enough fear similar abandon connect group led emsisoft discov vulner would use recov file victim dark side patch vulner januari emsisoft use recov file blackmatt launch summer tinker platform accident reopen vulner good thing come end accord emsisoft s blog blackmatt recent harden platform group s detractor start exploit glitch communic system allow anyon enter negoti communic victim though mention name appear refer new cooper ransomwar negoti someon — alleg victim — post timeless respons accus cooper violat ransomwar rule contact polic harden platform remov vulner emsisoft discov accord blog compani felt could come forward abl without interrupt abil wosar said emsisoft similar unpublic capabl ransomwar servic beyond blackmatt team identifi vulner dozen activ ransomwar famili case recov vast major victim encrypt data without ransom payment said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'flaw', 'cryptography']"
110,,Ransomware Group Targets Financial Firms With Phishing,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32754/Ransomware-Group-Targets-Financial-Firms-With-Phishing.html,25/10/2021,"The Russian-based ransomware group dubbed TA505 has been around for at least half a dozen years, perpetrating massive email attacks against various industries around the world. Now, it appears, it is the financial industry’s turn. After reportedly fine-tuning its signature malware and scripting languages, the group has had North American banks, credit unions and other financial services firms in its sights since last month. Targeting various institutions with an email phishing campaign dubbed ""MirrorBlast,"" users are directed to a fraudulent site where FSI employees may accidentally download malware onto their corporate computers or other devices. Ivan Tsarynny, CEO and co-founder of Toronto-based Feroot, a client-side security vendor, pointed out that while financial services institutions have long been “under siege by cybercriminals,"" these enterprises typically have the most “advanced cybersecurity programs, practices and teams deployed.” “FSIs are much better prepared than most other types of businesses to thwart ransomware attacks,” he said. ""This means lots of internal cybersecurity training, strong passwords, enterprise-wide multi-factor authentication, well-defined vulnerability and patch management strategies, and more. Ransomware is one of dozens of attack vectors.” Still, TA505, which has been dormant for a while, is a sleeping giant that is not to be trifled with. It is believed to have caused more than $100 million in losses over the past few years, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. (In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice even issued sanctions against some reputed members of TA505, in the face of malware threats they already posed.) And it’s not just U.S. FSIs under fire, but also financial firms in Canada, Europe and Asia, according to a recent report from cybersecurity vendor Morphisec. However, to really make an impact, ransomware attacks must hit the server, and yet attacks like these tend to come in through the client side, according to Tsarynny. “Cybercriminals are finding they can easily deploy malicious third-party JavaScript on FSI web applications and web pages, and can skim user data,” he said. “Criminals don't have to use traditional server-side attacks like phishing or ransomware attacks to collect FSI customer data. They can skim the information from banking websites and web applications from the user's browser.” And, no matter how ransomware threats are worked out, for FSIs in particular, the concern over these kinds of security compromises also encompasses compliance and privacy concerns. The European Union’s precedent-setting General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR], implemented three years ago, has set the standard that many U.S. states, as well as other countries, have followed in terms of laying down the law for the protection of customer data by companies. If a ransomware threat like that posed by TA505 impacts customers in a state where they have instituted more aggressive privacy laws, what then? “All it takes is one frustrated FSI customer who is a European national to make a complaint to launch a GDPR investigation,” said Tsarynny, pointing out that the minimum 20 million euro fine, or 4% of annual turnover, is just a fraction of the cost to ”the FSI if data is ultimately stolen during a ransomware.” Indeed, an FSI might need to bear litigation costs, incident response costs, lost customers and the financial damage of a tarnished brand.  ""A ransomware or client-side attack might drive customers to switch in droves,” suggested Tsarynny. And, while ransomware is increasingly pervasive, it is only one of many growing attack vectors against FSIs. “Banks are woefully unprepared to deal with client-side threats,” said Tsarynny. “If a criminal is able to deploy a keylogger script on a bank's website, they can capture usernames and passwords, and then can control the FSI customer's bank account. Criminals can make a quick buck without much effort.”",russianbas ransomwar group dub ta around least half dozen year perpetr massiv email attack various industri around world appear financi industri turn report finetun signatur malwar script languag group north american bank credit union financi servic firm sight sinc last month target various institut email phish campaign dub mirrorblast user direct fraudul site fsi employe may accident download malwar onto corpor comput devic ivan tsarynni ceo cofound torontobas feroot clientsid secur vendor point financi servic institut long sieg cybercrimin enterpris typic advanc cybersecur program practic team deploy fsis much better prepar type busi thwart ransomwar attack said mean lot intern cybersecur train strong password enterprisewid multifactor authent welldefin vulner patch manag strategi ransomwar one dozen attack vector still ta dormant sleep giant trifl believ caus million loss past year accord u treasuri depart decemb u depart justic even issu sanction reput member ta face malwar threat alreadi pose u fsis fire also financi firm canada europ asia accord recent report cybersecur vendor morphisec howev realli make impact ransomwar attack must hit server yet attack like tend come client side accord tsarynni cybercrimin find easili deploy malici thirdparti javascript fsi web applic web page skim user data said crimin nt use tradit serversid attack like phish ransomwar attack collect fsi custom data skim inform bank websit web applic user s browser matter ransomwar threat work fsis particular concern kind secur compromis also encompass complianc privaci concern european union precedentset general data protect regul gdpr implement three year ago set standard mani u state well countri follow term lay law protect custom data compani ransomwar threat like pose ta impact custom state institut aggress privaci law take one frustrat fsi custom european nation make complaint launch gdpr investig said tsarynni point minimum million euro fine annual turnov fraction cost fsi data ultim stolen ransomwar inde fsi might need bear litig cost incid respons cost lost custom financi damag tarnish brand ransomwar clientsid attack might drive custom switch drove suggest tsarynni ransomwar increas pervas one mani grow attack vector fsis bank woefulli unprepar deal clientsid threat said tsarynni crimin abl deploy keylogg script bank s websit captur usernam password control fsi custom s bank account crimin make quick buck without much effort ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'password', 'phish']"
111,,Republicans Want The Brakes Pumped On Aviation Cybersecurity,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32747/Republicans-Want-The-Brakes-Pumped-On-Aviation-Cybersecurity.html,22/10/2021,"Five Republican senators are asking the Transportation Security Administration to hold off imposing new emergency cybersecurity regulations on the rail and aviation industries so they can engage with companies through the normal regulatory process. In an Oct. 20 letter to TSA Administrator David Pekoske, the five lawmakers questioned whether the rules needed to be fast tracked through an emergency security directive, saying the Biden administration has not demonstrated that these industries are facing an immediate threat. “We recognize that circumstances sometimes demand that TSA act quickly using emergency authority. Nevertheless, the very importance of effective cybersecurity for critical infrastructure, such as the rail, rail transit, and aviation systems, counsels against acting rashly in the absence of a genuine emergency,” the senators wrote. On Oct. 6, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the TSA would soon issue a new security directive that would require railroad and transit systems to report to the government when they’re hacked, designate a point person at their company to interact with the government on cybersecurity issues and develop proactive incident response plans. Mayorkas said that his department will be “coordinating and consulting” with industry as it develops the railway directive and will be issuing a separate set of voluntary standards for lower risk surface transportation entities. But the senators object to the use of an emergency directive and claim the moves are being rushed without sector-specific input in a way that could lead to “unintended consequences” on the operations of essential travel and transportation industries. They point out that a national security memorandum on critical infrastructure cybersecurity the administration put out in May urged companies to work collaboratively with the government, arguing “a more deliberate approach” through the normal regulatory process “will reduce the risks and increase the benefits.” “Prescriptive requirements may be out of step with current practices and limit the affected industries’ ability to respond to evolving threats, thereby lessening security,” the senators wrote. “Further, prescriptive requirements may have unintended consequences, such as imposing unnecessary operational delays at a time of unprecedented congestion in the nation’s supply chain. Additionally, allowing outside experts to comment will lead to more effective and sustainable cybersecurity actions and measures.” The letter was signed by Sens.

112,,TSA Announces New Pipeline Security Order,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32484/TSA-Announces-New-Pipeline-Security-Order.html,21/07/2021,"Though details are under wraps, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced Tuesday that the Transportation Security Agency has issued its anticipated second order on oil and gas pipeline security. “The lives and livelihoods of the American people depend on our collective ability to protect our nation’s critical infrastructure from evolving threats,” said Mayorkas through a press release. “Through this security directive, DHS can better ensure the pipeline sector takes the steps necessary to safeguard their operations from rising cyber threats, and better protect our national and economic security. Public-private partnerships are critical to the security of every community across our country and DHS will continue working closely with our private sector partners to support their operations and increase their cybersecurity resilience.” The order follows a similar action in May as part of the Biden administration's efforts to respond to a destabilizing ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, which supplies fuel across the East Coast. The TSA is the DHS agency in charge of pipeline security, though it works closely with CISA in developing cybersecurity decisions. When it announced the first order, the TSA said a second, more detailed order would soon follow. As expected, Homeland Security has not released the specifics of the order. In June, Sonya Proctor, assistant administrator for surface operations for the TSA, told a House hearing that the second order would be marked ""security-sensitive information,"" something not-quite-classified but still seen as too much of a risk for public eyes. At the time, Proctor did say that the order will ""have the force of a regulation that would require more specific mitigation measures. And it will ultimately include more specific requirements with regard to assessment,"" she said, later adding that the directive would be subject to inspection by the TSA's principal security investigators."" ""It will have a lot more detail and be more prescriptive in terms of the mitigation measures required,"" she said. The first order was more general. Pipeline operators were required to alert CISA of all cybersecurity incidents,  companies needed to create an always available coordinator to handle security problems, and pipelines were given 30 days to audit for cybersecurity guidelines that had not previously been mandatory or enforced, and develop a plan to plug any gaps. Earlier in the day, at a hearing about ransomware,  Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., expressed deep concerns about pipeline security, saying he felt that the best way to disincentivize ransomware and ensure critical operations would be to build a secondary pipeline to shadow existing infrastructure.

Emily Langlie, communications director for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Seattle, said the government added eight new charges on top of the two originally filed in August 2019. It also upped the number of victimized companies from four to eight. News of the superseding indictment was first published in The Record, which reported that Thompson used the knowledge she gained as an Amazon employee along with scripts to scan for Amazon Web Service servers where web application firewalls had been misconfigured. The indictment said Thompson accessed these systems and downloaded data onto a server she kept at home. She's also alleged to have used cryptominer software on some of the misconfigured servers to generate profits for herself. The new charges, based on analysis done the past several months on data seized from Thompson’s computers and servers, are as follows: six counts of computer fraud and abuse, one count of access device fraud, and one count of aggravated identity theft. Based on the new charges, Thompson faces up to 20 years in prison, a marked increase from the five years she faced from the original charges. Thompson pleaded not guilty in August 2019 and was released on pre-trial bond. The trial was delayed several times for two main reasons: the pandemic, and the large amount of evidence federal prosecutors had to analyze.

114,,How Dow Jones Used The Pandemic To Undergo A Zero Trust Overhaul,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32299/How-Dow-Jones-Used-The-Pandemic-To-Undergo-A-Zero-Trust-Overhaul.html,19/05/2021,"While zero trust may be ill defined for some in the research community, the concept is helping to translate previously abstract or technical concepts about risk to a new audience, and spurring systemic transformation of security operations across companies in a way that other frameworks or guidance have failed to do. One example of this is the way Dow Jones Chemical used the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to fundamentally overhaul its security practices. Like many large companies in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Dow Jones had to adapt to a “new reality” that meant more than simply re-architecting their networks to manage more remote users. It changed what was considered normal within that network, introducing more users overall, more mobile devices popping up on the network, and new cloud applications and IoT devices. “What zero trust is helping us [to do] is manage the new environment, the new ecosystem we have to support now,” said Mauricio Guerra, Dow Jones Chemical's director of global information security in keynote at the RSA Conference May 18. Click here for more coverage of the 2021 RSA Conference. Not surprisingly, one of the first priorities Dow Jones focused on was providing employees secure access to the internet and company IT resources while they worked from home. That’s often where most companies start (and a fair amount end) their zero trust journey, but Guerra said they then established a new conditional access and authentication regime for users across the company. They replaced their telecommunications network and built a new software-defined wide area network to handle policy, security and networking functions. The manufacturing company will continue to rely heavily on connected devices, and are also developing security models to manage IoT device security. While more and more C-Suite executives are embracing the idea, Guerra said these advocates need to go into “selling mode” internally to get similar buy in from their IT and security teams. While zero trust essentially draws from classic, fundamental cybersecurity principles around risk management, it’s a shift from how most corporate IT networks are defended today. That means time before the approach will replace that status quo with processes that treat every device, user and system on a network as if it could be turned against the business at any time. “We need to convince, we need to engage our IT workforce that this is the way to work, because it’s completely different from what we used to do before, with firewalls that are either on or off,” said Guerra. “Now it’s different. We need to engage our IT workforce and train them to do something different.”",zero trust may ill defin research communiti concept help translat previous abstract technic concept risk new audienc spur system transform secur oper across compani way framework guidanc fail one exampl way dow jone chemic use coronavirus pandem excus fundament overhaul secur practic like mani larg compani wake coronavirus pandem dow jone adapt new realiti meant simpli rearchitect network manag remot user chang consid normal within network introduc user overal mobil devic pop network new cloud applic iot devic zero trust help u manag new environ new ecosystem support said mauricio guerra dow jone chemic s director global inform secur keynot rsa confer may click coverag rsa confer surpris one first prioriti dow jone focus provid employe secur access internet compani resourc work home often compani start fair amount end zero trust journey guerra said establish new condit access authent regim user across compani replac telecommun network built new softwaredefin wide area network handl polici secur network function manufactur compani continu reli heavili connect devic also develop secur model manag iot devic secur csuit execut embrac idea guerra said advoc need go sell mode intern get similar buy secur team zero trust essenti draw classic fundament cybersecur principl around risk manag shift corpor network defend today mean time approach replac status quo process treat everi devic user system network could turn busi time need convinc need engag workforc way work complet differ use firewal either said guerra differ need engag workforc train someth differ ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'conference']"
115,,Reddit Takes Bug Bounty Program Public,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32195/Reddit-Takes-Bug-Bounty-Program-Public.html,14/04/2021,"Reddit announced Wednesday that it is taking its bug bounty program public. The popular social news site and community forum platform has run a private program with HackerOne for the past three years, but hopes that by going public, it can more quickly address vulnerabilities, improve its defenses and keep the platform secure. “We’ve seen great engagement and success to date, having awarded $140,000 in bounties across 300 reports covering the main reddit.com platform, which worked well for our limited scope during the private program,” the company said in a press release. “With our continued growth and visibility, we’re now ready to make the program public and expand participation to anyone wanting to make a meaningful security impact on Reddit.” Reddit security wizard Spencer Koch said the company has always leveraged the community to help find and fix bugs in the platform; that’s how the company found several of its engineers over the years. Koch said the security team started back in 2018 when Reddit formalized its private bug bounty program. As Reddit grew in size and influence over the years, it scaled the program by expanding its scope, improving bounty payouts, and supporting security researchers with context and insight into how Reddit works. Spencer said that when a hacker finds a bug, the security team does an initial triage to gauge its severity; otherwise, it will let HackerOne’s triage service do the initial screening, reproduction info gathering and sanity check before one of Reddit’s senior security engineers starts the hunt. “Our security team is heavily embedded with our engineering teams, so we’re perusing code to find the root cause and proposing possible fixes for our engineering counterparts,” Spencer said. “Enriching our tickets with this data means our tickets are higher quality, and easily reproducible and consumable by our devs, so we all can get to fixing faster.” Allison Miller, Reddit’s vice president of trust and CISO, added that the company’s security team has already been embedded into feature launches at several key points in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and they work closely with the platform’s various engineering departments. In the final phase of a feature rollout, the team makes sure it adds the new feature into the bug bounty scope and offers details on how to test it or where to find it. “A great example of this is when we were alpha testing a new Reddit embed feature,” Miller said. “We notified our researchers about it and got feedback that deleted posts were getting rendered due to some bad logic, which resulted in reality not matching design. Through hacker power, we were able to catch this early before general availability where it would have become a larger issue.” Interested security researchers can find Reddit’s bug bounty program on HackerOne.",reddit announc wednesday take bug bounti program public popular social news site communiti forum platform run privat program hackeron past three year hope go public quick address vulner improv defens keep platform secur seen great engag success date award bounti across report cover main redditcom platform work well limit scope privat program compani said press releas continu growth visibl readi make program public expand particip anyon want make meaning secur impact reddit reddit secur wizard spencer koch said compani alway leverag communiti help find fix bug platform compani found sever engin year koch said secur team start back reddit formal privat bug bounti program reddit grew size influenc year scale program expand scope improv bounti payout support secur research context insight reddit work spencer said hacker find bug secur team initi triag gaug sever otherwis let hackeron triag servic initi screen reproduct info gather saniti check one reddit senior secur engin start hunt secur team heavili embed engin team perus code find root caus propos possibl fix engin counterpart spencer said enrich ticket data mean ticket higher qualiti easili reproduc consum dev get fix faster allison miller reddit vice presid trust ciso ad compani secur team alreadi embed featur launch sever key point softwar develop lifecycl sdlc work close platform various engin depart final phase featur rollout team make sure add new featur bug bounti scope offer detail test find great exampl alpha test new reddit emb featur miller said notifi research got feedback delet post get render due bad logic result realiti match design hacker power abl catch earli general avail would becom larger issu interest secur research find reddit bug bounti program hackeron ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'social']"
116,,Iranian Credential Thieves Target Medical Researchers,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32153/Iranian-Credential-Thieves-Target-Medical-Researchers.html,31/03/2021,"In late 2020, a well-known hacker group believed to be sponsored by the Iranian government started a credential harvesting campaign targeting United States and Israeli medical personnel, according to new research from Proofpoint. Researchers attribute the campaign, which it has dubbed ""BadBlood,"" to Charming Kitten, also known as Phosphorous or, in Proofpoint's parlance, TA453. Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint, noted that the choice of targets is an interesting feature of the campaign. “TA453 typically concentrates on targeting dissidents, academics, diplomats, and journalists. BadBlood shifted targeting to medical research (genetics, oncology, and neurology) and possibly patient-related information,"" she told SC Media via email. Proofpoint has no conclusive sense of what the motivation was for the campaign. ""As collaboration for medical research is often conducted informally over email,"" said DeGrippo, ""this campaign may demonstrate that a subset of TA453 operators have an intelligence requirement to collect specific medical information related to genetic, oncology, or neurology research. Alternatively, this campaign may demonstrate an interest in the patient information of the targeted medical personnel or an aim to use the recipients' accounts in further phishing campaigns."" BadBlood leveraged phishing lures related to Israeli nuclear weapon capabilities sent from a fake Gmail account purporting to belong to Daniel Zajfman, an Israeli physicist and president of the Weizmann Institute of Science. According to DeGrippo, it is common for TA453 to use political lures, including ones about nuclear proliferation, even when targeting unrelated sectors. The lure emails linked to a spoofed Microsoft OneDrive page, which then collected login information. Proofpoint linked the campaign to TA453 through the use of consistent infrastructure and similar lures. The vendor does not independently attribute the group to Iran, though the report notes that the United States and several industry groups, including Microsoft, have made the connection in the past. ""TA453 routinely attempts to obtain the email credentials of individuals that may possess information aligned with the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard's] collection priorities,” said DeGrippo. According to the report, the BadBlood name was chosen ""based on the medical focus and continued geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel.""",late wellknown hacker group believ sponsor iranian govern start credenti harvest campaign target unit state isra medic personnel accord new research proofpoint research attribut campaign dub badblood charm kitten also known phosphor proofpoint s parlanc ta sherrod degrippo senior director threat research detect proofpoint note choic target interest featur campaign ta typic concentr target dissid academ diplomat journalist badblood shift target medic research genet oncolog neurolog possibl patientrel inform told sc medium via email proofpoint conclus sens motiv campaign collabor medic research often conduct inform email said degrippo campaign may demonstr subset ta oper intellig requir collect specif medic inform relat genet oncolog neurolog research altern campaign may demonstr interest patient inform target medic personnel aim use recipi account phish campaign badblood leverag phish lure relat isra nuclear weapon capabl sent fake gmail account purport belong daniel zajfman isra physicist presid weizmann institut scienc accord degrippo common ta use polit lure includ one nuclear prolifer even target unrel sector lure email link spoof microsoft onedr page collect login inform proofpoint link campaign ta use consist infrastructur similar lure vendor independ attribut group iran though report note unit state sever industri group includ microsoft made connect past ta routin attempt obtain email credenti individu may poss inform align islam revolutionari guard s collect prioriti said degrippo accord report badblood name chosen base medic focus continu geopolit tension iran israel ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'data loss', 'password', 'iran', 'science']"
117,,Apple Devs Targeted By Malicious Xcode Project,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32123/Apple-Devs-Targeted-By-Malicious-Xcode-Project.html,19/03/2021,"Researchers reported Thursday that threat actors have abused the Run Script feature in Apple’s Xcode integrated development environment (IDE) to infect Apple developers via shared Xcode projects. In a blog post, SentinelLabs researchers said the malicious Xcode project – XcodeSpy – installs a custom variant of the EggShell backdoor on the developer’s macOS computer. The backdoor is able to record the victim’s microphone, camera and keyboard entries, plus can upload and download files. The researchers added that other threat actors could use the XcodeSpy infection and that all Apple developers using Xcode should be cautious when adopting shared projects. According to the researchers, SentinelLabs learned about the trojanized Xcode project from an anonymous researcher. They said the malicious project functions as a doctored version of a legitimate, open-source project – available on GitHub – that offers iOS developers certain advanced features for animating the iOS Tab Bar. However, the trojanized XcodeSpy version of this project was changed to execute an obfuscated Run Script when the developer’s build target gets launched. The script contacts the attackers’ C2 infrastructure and drops a custom variant of the EggShell backdoor on the development machine. The malware then installs a user LaunchAgent for persistence. As part of the blog, the researchers offered some broader context, pointing out two ongoing and linked trends that bear watching: The targeting of developers and the use of supply chain attacks to infect large user bases. “Success begets more success is a theme around the supply chain attacks and targeting to developers,” said Brandon Hoffman, chief information security officer at Netenrich. “This discovery highlights the ever-pressing need for companies to embed security in development operations. Unfortunately, it also highlights a significant need to continuously validate code that’s used and shared by many, especially open-source projects. The security community has been concerned about open-source code for decades and while it has taken some time, the concerns were legitimate. Everybody will have to remain or become exceedingly vigilant with all entry points to their code, products and services they supply.” Greg Ake, a senior threat researcher at Huntress, added that this attack is a cause for concern because it can lead to a trickle-down infection and compromise of all customers that may use that app, putting them at risk to any number of abuses. “Consumers need to better understand where their apps and services are coming from and what access they are giving up using these services,” Ake said. “Likewise, software developers need to make use of a defined software development lifecycle. Ensuring security concepts and reviews are included in the development process can assist in reducing this risk. Many apps and software shops are small teams that do not have the skill or budget to afford security. That does not even take into consideration the work required to build it out and maintain it. The incentivization for security needs to be there to ensure supply chain attacks like this do not continue to increase in frequency.”",research report thursday threat actor abus run script featur appl xcode integr develop environ ide infect appl develop via share xcode project blog post sentinellab research said malici xcode project – xcodespi – instal custom variant eggshel backdoor develop maco comput backdoor abl record victim microphon camera keyboard entri plus upload download file research ad threat actor could use xcodespi infect appl develop use xcode cautious adopt share project accord research sentinellab learn trojan xcode project anonym research said malici project function doctor version legitim opensourc project – avail github – offer io develop certain advanc featur anim io tab bar howev trojan xcodespi version project chang execut obfusc run script develop build target get launch script contact attack c infrastructur drop custom variant eggshel backdoor develop machin malwar instal user launchag persist part blog research offer broader context point two ongo link trend bear watch target develop use suppli chain attack infect larg user base success beget success theme around suppli chain attack target develop said brandon hoffman chief inform secur offic netenrich discoveri highlight everpress need compani emb secur develop oper unfortun also highlight signific need continu valid code use share mani especi opensourc project secur communiti concern opensourc code decad taken time concern legitim everybodi remain becom exceed vigil entri point code product servic suppli greg ake senior threat research huntress ad attack caus concern lead trickledown infect compromis custom may use app put risk number abus consum need better understand app servic come access give use servic ake said likewis softwar develop need make use defin softwar develop lifecycl ensur secur concept review includ develop process assist reduc risk mani app softwar shop small team skill budget afford secur even take consider work requir build maintain incentiv secur need ensur suppli chain attack like continu increas frequenc ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'trojan', 'apple']"
118,,Three More North Korean Hackers Charged,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/32032/Three-More-North-Korean-Hackers-Charged.html,18/02/2021,"The Department of Justice has unsealed an indictment against three members of Lazarus Group for a wide range of financially-motivated hacks against private businesses that authorities said were designed to steal $1.3 billion in currency and cryptocurrency and further other strategic interests for the North Korean government. The charges captures years-worth of North Korean hacking, including the widely publicized 2014 Sony hack, the 2016 hack of the Central Bank of Bangladesh, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack and others. In an indictment filed in the Central District of California Court, Justice officials allege that Jon Chang Hyok, Park Jin Hyok and Kim Il are members of the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau who conducted a series of computer intrusions using personas and spear-phishing techniques designed to imitate cryptocurrency investment schemes in order to get the victims to download malware. The group’s activities were both “revenge and financially motivated,” sometimes destroying computer systems or deploying ransomware on victim devices. Park was already charged in 2018 for the WannaCry attacks, and the indictment expands charges against him for other hacking campaigns. “The department’s criminal charges are uniquely credible forms of attribution — we can prove these allegations beyond a reasonable doubt using only unclassified, admissible evidence,” said John Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security in a call with reporters. “And they are the only way in which the department speaks. If the choice here is between remaining silent while we at the department watch nations engage in malicious, norms-violating cyber activity, or charges these cases, the choice is obvious — we will charge them.” Law enforcement officials said the group has also targeted more than $1.2 billion in funds from banks across four continents since 2018 through cryptocurrency heists, ATM cash outs and developed new forms of malware. They also charged a Canadian national for facilitating tens of millions of dollars in money laundering schemes. U.S. authorities said they are the in process of seizing and in some cases returning millions of dollars in stolen funds to victim organizations. “The Indictment contains significant allegations about the development and spread of a series of malicious applications, purportedly for trading and storing cryptocurrency but which were actually designed to give the North Koreans a backdoor into computer systems…some of which were still developed only a few months ago,” said Tracy Wilkison, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, FBI and Department of Treasury also released a joint advisory and analysis of multiple variants of malware, called AppleJeus, that the North Koreans used as a trojanized version of software designed to impersonate a legitimate cryptocurrency trading company and target Windows and Mac operating systems. The advisory contains technical analysis as well as indicators of compromise that security teams can use to detect the malware. “This advisory will provide the financial sector and the cybersecurity community with a detailed picture of North Korean threat capability that will assist cyber defenders in multiple sectors in identifying and mitigating this active threat, further demonstrating the value of interagency partnerships in combating cybercrime and malicious nation-state actor activity,” said Paul Neff, Director of Cyber Policy, Preparedness and Response in the Office of Cybersecurity and Critical infrastructure Protection at Treasury in a statement.",depart justic unseal indict three member lazarus group wide rang financiallymotiv hack privat busi author said design steal billion currenc cryptocurr strateg interest north korean govern charg captur yearsworth north korean hack includ wide public soni hack hack central bank bangladesh wannacri ransomwar attack other indict file central district california court justic offici alleg jon chang hyok park jin hyok kim il member north korean reconnaiss general bureau conduct seri comput intrus use persona spearphish techniqu design imit cryptocurr invest scheme order get victim download malwar group activ reveng financi motiv sometim destroy comput system deploy ransomwar victim devic park alreadi charg wannacri attack indict expand charg hack campaign depart crimin charg uniqu credibl form attribut — prove alleg beyond reason doubt use unclassifi admiss evid said john demer assist attorney general nation secur call report way depart speak choic remain silent depart watch nation engag malici normsviol cyber activ charg case choic obvious — charg them law enforc offici said group also target billion fund bank across four contin sinc cryptocurr heist atm cash out develop new form malwar also charg canadian nation facilit ten million dollar money launder scheme u author said process seiz case return million dollar stolen fund victim organ indict contain signific alleg develop spread seri malici applic purport trade store cryptocurr actual design give north korean backdoor comput systems…som still develop month ago said traci wilkison act u attorney central district california cybersecur infrastructur secur agenc fbi depart treasuri also releas joint advisori analysi multipl variant malwar call applejeus north korean use trojan version softwar design imperson legitim cryptocurr trade compani target window mac oper system advisori contain technic analysi well indic compromis secur team use detect malwar advisori provid financi sector cybersecur communiti detail pictur north korean threat capabl assist cyber defend multipl sector identifi mitig activ threat demonstr valu interag partnership combat cybercrim malici nationst actor activ said paul neff director cyber polici prepared respons offic cybersecur critic infrastructur protect treasuri statement ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'data loss', 'fraud', 'cyberwar']"
119,,Suspected Hezbollah APT Group Breached 250 Servers,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31976/Suspected-Hezbollah-APT-Group-Breached-250-Servers.html,"/02/1,","Some 250 servers were apparently breached by the Lebanese Cedar APT group, an organization with suspected links to the Hezbollah Cyber Unit in Lebanon. The target victims include companies from many countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Valuable information was stolen over periods of months and years,  ClearSky researchers wrote in a blog posted. The security firm, which first detected suspicious activity in early 2020, said the attack was based on a modified JSP file browser with a unique string that the adversary used to deploy “Explosive” V4 Remote Access Tool (RAT) or “Caterpillar” V2 WebShell in the victims’ networks. The file was installed in vulnerable Atlassian Jira and Oracle 10g servers.  Lebanese Cedar exploited 1-day publicly known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2012-3152 to install the JSP in vulnerable servers. The APT group – also referred to as “Volatile Cedar” – has been operating since 2012 and has kept a low profile, flying under the radar, since 2015 when its operations were first discovered by CheckPoint researchers and Kaspersky Labs. ClearSky agrees with CheckPoint’s initial report that Lebanese Cedar APT is motivated by political and ideological interests, targeting individuals, companies and institutions worldwide and has strong ties to the Lebanese government or a political group in Lebanon. The Lebanese group’s attacks started by using known vulnerabilities on public web servers, then distributing custom malware to steal files, while staying hidden, said Ivan Righi, cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, added that. The group has used a custom-written malware called “Explosive,” an info-stealing Trojan that the group has used since 2015, he said. The Explosive malware appears to have gone through multiple versions, usually updated to avoid antivirus detection. “The latest campaign used a new version of Explosive with new capabilities,” Righi said. “Lebanese Cedar, or Volatile Cedar, is technically-advanced and has shown effective use of tactics, characterizing them as a high-level threat. Activity was last publicly-reported on in 2015 and is linked to the Shia Islamist political party and militant group Hezbollah. They likely conducted this campaign to support Hezbollah's motives to obtain sensitive information.”",server appar breach lebanes cedar apt group organ suspect link hezbollah cyber unit lebanon target victim includ compani mani countri includ unit state unit kingdom saudi arabia egypt jordan lebanon israel palestinian author valuabl inform stolen period month year clearski research wrote blog post secur firm first detect suspici activ earli said attack base modifi jsp file browser uniqu string adversari use deploy explos v remot access tool rat caterpillar v webshel victim network file instal vulner atlassian jira oracl g server lebanes cedar exploit day public known vulner cve instal jsp vulner server apt group – also refer volatil cedar – oper sinc kept low profil fli radar sinc oper first discov checkpoint research kasperski lab clearski agre checkpoint initi report lebanes cedar apt motiv polit ideolog interest target individu compani institut worldwid strong tie lebanes govern polit group lebanon lebanes group attack start use known vulner public web server distribut custom malwar steal file stay hidden said ivan righi cyber threat intellig analyst digit shadow ad group use customwritten malwar call explos infost trojan group use sinc said explos malwar appear gone multipl version usual updat avoid antivirus detect latest campaign use new version explos new capabl righi said lebanes cedar volatil cedar technicallyadvanc shown effect use tactic character highlevel threat activ last publiclyreport link shia islamist polit parti milit group hezbollah like conduct campaign support hezbollah s motif obtain sensit inform ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'cyberwar', 'terror', 'backdoor']"

This is the fourth in that series. Like coronavirus, the election is a big story that permeates all other big stories. If there is a regulatory or legislative solution to any problem raised in 2020, it will be up to the government of 2021 to achieve.   As we wrote in October, a Joe Biden administration would bring with it a boatload of potential changes. Experts describe President Donald Trump’s approach to China, a leading force in hacking for industrial espionage and a consistent complication in supply chain security, as transactional and impulsive; Biden, they hope, would be more strategic. Vice President Elect Kamala Harris’s role as a California attorney general, focusing on privacy issues, places her in a unique position to usher in a federal privacy law. And optimism remains as evergreen as it has the last three administrations that the next administration will be the one to pass a comprehensive technology policy.   But while all of that is speculative, a few aspects of how the government may handle interactions with the private sector on information security have begun to crystalize. From silos to collaboration? If confirmed as secretary, for example, Alejandro Mayorkas will be the first person known for his work on federal cybersecurity policy to head the Department of Homeland Security. Mayorkas was a critical figure in creating the differentiation of powers in cybersecurity among federal agencies as a deputy secretary of DHS during the Obama administration.   More on point for chief information security officers and the security operations center, Mayorkas was a massive proponent of threat information sharing between federal agencies, federal and private sector entities, and even between international allies.   That means Mayorkas could be a potential advocate to address many of the ways information sharing falls short.  “As we look to the next four years, we need more cross sector and cross government communication,” said Kiersten Todt, managing director of the Cyber Readiness Institute, which champions small and medium sized business cybersecurity. “My sense is that Mayorkas understands this.”  There has been longstanding consternation in the private sector over the quality of data that comes from federal threat information spigots. It is an issue DHS is keenly aware of; an inspector general’s report earlier this year called for improvements to the automated intelligence system (AIS) due to low usership.   “We’ve always struggled with the private sector saying they give more information to the government than the government gives back,” said Todt.   The problem goes deep, with many CISOs expressing feelings that the current AIS is a waste of their time, a low signal-to-noise system where data has been sanitized of most of its usefulness before the government spits it back.   Many CISOs find the data that comes out of AIS hard to apply to any specific setting.   “Sharing indicators of compromise is not good enough,” said Greg Touhill, former federal CISO and current president of Appgate Federal Group. “We need to share timely information and need to share context. It’s really important to say, ‘This is what we think they’re after.’”  The U.S. intelligence community is not currently configured to emphasize threat sharing with the private sector. This a key point in a recent blog post from Microsoft president Brad Smith about the potential policy responses to prevent the next SolarWinds fiasco. If the intelligence community found out through covert means that Russia was intending to capitalize upon supply chain attacks, there is a reasonable chance that information might not be shared with the tech companies who make up the supply chains.   Smith compares this to 9/11, where intelligence silos prevented critical information from traversing agencies in a way that could have prevented the attacks. But a better comparison might be the 2016 election, where the federal government had fully developed an information sharing plan with states. Russia breached several states during the election. By 2020, DHS had a plan in place.   “The after-action report about SolarWinds is going to be fascinating,” said Todt. “We’ll see if there was a disconnect between intelligence and industry."" Intelligence sharing is not necessarily only an issue for the DHS to address. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 provides for a new White House position of national cybersecurity director to help coordinate national cybersecurity strategy. The position is a product of the Cybersecurity Solarium Commission, a working group that included legislative and executive branch personnel and private sector representatives. Many are hoping the national cybersecurity director will also improve coordination with critical private sector entities.   “Hopefully, the right person in that job moves the government culturally toward sharing information with critical private infrastructure,” said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisc., who served on the Cybersecurity Solarium Commission.  Other ideas in the NDAA that came out of the Commission included extending capabilities of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for the protection of government networks. Combined, the director and strengthened federal defense would prevent a future SolarWinds from going unnoticed.   “The fact that FireEye, a private sector group, alerted us to the breach and public sector did not notice is a black eye on the public sector,” said Gallagher. ""In a perfect universe, it’s the government who notifies the companies.”   The primary purpose of the national cybersecurity director would be to make sure the government’s total cybersecurity strategy is coherent across agencies. That, too, has an impact on the private sector, providing a final word when, say, Department of Commerce priorities conflict with those of the Department of Defense. That authoritative check, what the Solarium Commission has colorfully referred to as a “single throat to throttle when things go wrong,” does not currently exist.   “When the kids are fighting, you want someone to say ‘knock that crap out,’” said Touhill.   What will stay the same How information flows between the government and private sector is a key opportunity for improvement. But there are also opportunities to expand information sharing across industries as well. Todt sees this as a potential job for CISA, which despite a rocky ending to 2020, had been a major success story since its inception in 2018.   CISA, under former director Christopher Krebs, built a reputation for industry collaboration it carries into 2021, despite President Trump firing Krebs after CISA would not back unfounded claims about election tampering. Like most agencies, the ongoing mission will not change even with changes to the top.   It’s unlikely, for example, that a Department of Justice strategy to confront Chinese activity will change under Biden; it’s a strategy whose origins come from the Clinton administration, and whose recent prosecutions were the culmination of work performed under several attorneys general.   But a volatile China situation that entangles cybersecurity with trade, supply chains, relationships with allies and human rights concerns, still appears likely to many experts to force a confrontation.   “China’s continued behaviors are going to force governments and private companies to make increasingly tough decisions,” said Jonathan Reiber, former chief strategy officer for cyber policy at the Department of Defense and current senior director for cybersecurity strategy and policy at AttackIQ.   A change in government isn’t just limited to the executive branch. Rep. Will Hurd, R-Texas, is retiring this year, which will deprive Congress of one of its most active cybersecurity voices. Hurd was an advocate for issues that are important, but too drab to get on Congress’s radar, like upgrading federal technology and reworking international export agreements on the export of cybersecurity products.   2021, just like any other year, will be as defined by the drab policies the government will bore itself with as the exciting emerging threats.   “Is it exciting? No,” said Touhill. “But neither is wearing a mask or washing your hands.” ",come close sc medium deliv seri articl pick high impact event trend last year predict factor communiti strategi beyond

121,,Here Are The Critical Responses Required Of All Businesses After The SolarWinds Supply-Chain Hack,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31852/Here-Are-The-Critical-Responses-Required-Of-All-Businesses-After-The-SolarWinds-Supply-Chain-Hack.html,16/12/2020,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Treasury Department and FireEye are among the most prominent victims affected by the supply chain attack on SolarWinds network monitoring software. But these data breaches are just scratching the surface of one of the most significant foreign hacking incidents in history – one that will have long-lasting repercussions. SolarWinds estimates that between last March and June, roughly 18,000 user organizations downloaded updates of its Orion software that Russian APT actors allegedly corrupted with Sunburst backdoor malware. That attack allowed the culprits to perform reconnaissance, elevate their privileges, move laterally and steal data. Now SolarWinds customers – over 300,000 of them, including most of the Fortune 500 – must determine whether or not they were among those impacted by the cyber espionage operation. Near-term: Stop the bleeding For starters, customers must confirm precisely what data and systems were affected, then mitigate the damage and remove all signs of persistence before they can safely use the Orion software again. In the longer term, companies will also have to take a hard look at new safeguards and internal security policies for all third-party software, especially programs that enable highly privileged visibility and access into sensitive systems. In light of the attack, DHS’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) ordered federal agencies to “immediately disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products, versions 2019.4 through 2020.2.1 HF1, from their network” and block all connections from systems using those products. Corporations may wish to do the same to prevent any further cyber espionage activity from taking place. But that’s just one facet of what should be a far more comprehensive response. “I would be asking the team to stop and drop any other work, assess the software and versions in use, see if the malicious updates were applied, and then respond accordingly,” said Ben Johnson, former NSA hacker, O365 security expert and CTO of SaaS security firm Obsidian. To that end, John Mancini, senior product manager at Vectra, said that a core point of the DHS’ guidance for remediating the SolarWinds hack is to analyze for any listed indicators of compromise and then “identify potential behaviors in metadata that may be related to the compromise.” Another critical part of that response will be keeping the public informed. “In the event data or critical systems were compromised, companies should be taking the unfortunate but necessary step of public disclosure and assessing not just the damage caused by SolarWinds’ compromise, but also the factors within their own networks that contributed to attackers moving freely between systems and networks,” said Jack Mannino, CEO at nVisium. Kelvin Coleman, executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance,  listed out several crucial steps companies must implement, including “executing any incident response plans they have through their security teams/SOC; determining what data has been explicitly compromised or stolen in the process; simultaneously contacting suppliers, vendors, partners, etc. to alert them that they’ve been breached; enacting threat hunting protocols with a zero-trust philosophy in mind to figure out if there’s any evidence of continued intrusion in their networks; updating passwords, encryption measures and MFA ‘secrets’ credentials, [and] preparing a public disclosure strategy, especially if public/consumer data is determined to have been compromised.” Naturally, as the investigation continues, more information will surface. “For any customer of SolarWinds Orion, it is worth digging as deep as possible to understand the implications,” added Brandon Hoffman, chief information security officer at Netenrich. ""It's not clear whether this is a flaw that SolarWinds totally understands yet. If they do, a fix needs to be issued immediately. If not, it may be worth shutting down that system until there is one."" (A SolarWinds advisory does cite two hot fixes that the company recommends downloading.) Shutting down your system ""may seem like overkill, but the risk is obvious, especially for targets considered higher priority,"" Hoffman continued. ""We still don't know enough to determine if the attackers have been completely rooted out of the breached systems or even if the full extent of their lateral movements are known.” This, said Johnson, is why ""if you are impacted – or at least have the targeted software – you are going to have to do both a broad and potentially deep sweep of your environment as these actors appear sophisticated and therefore would try to embed their persistence in your environment.” But how long will this deep sweep take? Long enough to look for any signs of persistence, while also ensuring that whatever systems do not need to rely on SolarWinds are isolated from its capabilities.  “After months of incident response, hunting, patching, and tuning monitoring systems would it be safe to reconnect again? Going forward, the SolarWinds systems should be segmented away from other parts of the environment so that the impact of any future weaknesses is mitigated,"" said Johnson. Indeed, “many customers are skeptical of re-enabling this software in their environments until they have assurance that the malicious code was removed from public releases,"" added Mannino. ""Even if the malicious code were removed from the publicly available versions of these products and the attackers were successfully removed from the environment, it will take a wait-and-see approach for many organizations to re-enable these software packages.” Long-term: Newfound scrutiny of third-party software  Over the long term, certain companies or agencies are also likely to use this incident as a turning point to justify additional scrutiny of third-party software, and safeguards against its abuse. For instance, the SolarWinds hack will likely lead to ""stronger assessments of vendors and more defense in depth,” said Johnson. “Anything that becomes critical infrastructure and has pervasive access should be heavily monitored as not only would external adversaries be a risk, but any internal users who have access to it as well.” As reported by Krebs on Security, a SolarWinds support advisory noted that its Orion software may not always work right unless it its file directories are exempted from antivirus scans and group policy object restrictions. For some organizations, this incident may spell the end of such exceptions. “Internal security policies must take a trust but validate approach to all software that they deploy,” said Mancini. “Many third-party tools will trip defensive technologies, but that does not justify blanket whitelisting of these tools. An effective defensive posture must continue to keep these tools in view and to continue to monitor for new behaviors and deviations from traditional behaviors."" Meanwhile, Joe Slowik, senior security researcher at DomainTools, suggested that organizations may want to consider investing in security solutions designed to monitor network communications for anomalous traffic flows, “such as a SolarWinds server attempting to resolve a new, unexpected domain,” which might suggest your systems are receiving instructions from an attacker. “Thorough understanding of our own networks and visibility into network traffic flows can defeat even the most complex adversaries,” Slowik explained. Of course, rarely do security professionals encounter APT operations quite as sophisticated as this one. As FireEye noted in its own report on the attack, Sunburst malware “masquerades its network traffic as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and stores reconnaissance results within legitimate plugin configuration files, allowing it to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity.” This is one of multiple stealth capabilities that helped the operation go undetected for so long, along with a two-week dormancy period and the use of “obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers.” Indeed, Matt Ashburn, head of strategic initiatives and chief information security officer at the National Security Council, said that effective detection and mitigation of such supply chain threats “require concerted coordination among traditionally disparate teams, including procurement, logistics, compliance, and security teams.” Ashburn said that organizations looking to reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future must work to “fully understand and inventory all devices -- including make, model, and supplier information, including manufacturers, resellers, and sub-suppliers” and also “research each level of the supply chain to understand supplier relationships, security practices, and analyze potential risk.” Additionally, he recommends adopting a modern, zero-trust security architecture – perhaps one that prevents any outbound web communications “except those known and verified to be trusted connections.” Moreover, “further segmentation of networks and consolidation of technologies to reduce the complexity of systems would also help defenders have a more focused approach,"" said Johnson. “Supply chain security will be a front and center issue for many organizations as the fallout from this incident unfolds,” concluded Mannino. “In addition to traditional software security testing techniques such as code reviews and penetration testing, an increasing number of organizations may be interested in understanding how software behaves through malicious code reviews. These types of tests explore the likelihood that software contains embedded malware, through malicious code commits or by compromised third-party dependencies.” Coleman said that moving forward, organizations are going to have to hold third-party software providers more accountable for their security. ""Although this should have been status quo from the start, this incident should be a wake-up call to companies to keep security standards top of mind when vetting new third-party partners and reassessing existing ones,"" he said. ""Contracts should stipulate regular network testing protocols and ‘right to audit’ clauses, incident response measures should be transparent, and third-party vendors should have a track record of adhering to compliance standards (e.g. HIPAA, ITAR, PCI-DSS) and abiding by industry frameworks (e.g. as outlined by NIST)."" ""And while there are countless more behaviors and safeguards that businesses should be taking, it’s clear that this attack just opened up tons of eyes to the sort of destruction a supply chain attack can have,"" Coleman continued. ""Chances are we’ll see these sorts of measures become more commonplace as companies deal with the fallout.""",u depart homeland secur treasuri depart fireey among promin victim affect suppli chain

122,,What A Possible Trump Win Would Mean For Cyber,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31734/What-A-Possible-Trump-Win-Would-Mean-For-Cyber.html,"/11/5,","Just three months into his first term, with the flourish of a pen, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ostensibly to lay the groundwork for future cybersecurity policy. Now as Americans go to the polls in record numbers and Trump vies for re-election, his uneven cybersecurity policy offers a few clues into what he might prioritize during a second term. The greatest potential for progress, say some experts, may come from the expansion of some very distinct successes during his first term: the centralization of the security and resiliency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and development of cybersecurity guidance for the Defense Department. But before one can look ahead, he must look backwards. Having already done a close look at what a Biden-Harris administration might mean for cybersecurity policy, SC Media examines Trump's approach to cyber during his first term, for some insight into what could come from four more years. An uneven record The substance of that executive order three and a half years ago mirrored “the general approach to cybersecurity that started in the Bush administration and ran through the Obama administration,” as noted at the time by Michael Daniel, who served as special assistant and cybersecurity coordinator for the White House under President Barack Obama, and today is president and CEO of the Cyber Threat Alliance. Another Trump term might be more of the same, with the potential to rise above the political fray. “Cybersecurity policy has for more than a decade evolved at a rapid pace in a positive manner under both Republican and Democratic administrations, in part because it is such a technical field that requires professional technocratic input over and above partisan policy proposals,” says Jonathan Reiber, senior director for cybersecurity strategy and policy at AttackIQ and former chief strategist on cyber at the Defense Department during the Obama administration. “I expect that under either administration that trend will continue.” Lauded at the time for embracing the NIST framework – which is the de facto guidance for organizations set on building a strong cybersecurity posture – the 2017 EO was in effect, as Daniel said then, “a plan for a plan"" rather than an actual strategy. And for that matter, expectations during the first month of his presidency were fairly low. One month in, a NetSkope survey of 100 IT security professionals attending RSA found that 32 percent believed cybersecurity would be worse than in past administrations. Only 12 percent saw a brighter future for cyber. More than a fifth of respondents, 21 percent, said that the administration’s proposed cyber policies put their data at greater risk and 68 percent believed the U.S. would see an uptick in nation-state actors as a result of the administration’s nationalistic rhetoric. By comparison, only 11 percent didn’t believe there would be an increase in attacks. Those early concerns, as it turns out, weren’t completely unfounded. Attacks have most certainly continued to rise, though whether that is directly tied to administration policy is unclear. What has emerged from the Trump administration approach to cybersecurity is a mixed bag that has seen support for the NIST framework and a crackdown on Huawei, along with an embrace of leaders in countries like Russia and North Korea, and even China, despite their well-documented cyberattacks on the U.S. and its interests. Chloe Messdaghi, vice president of strategy at Point3 Security contends there's a lack of understanding of cybersecurity policy ramifications. She points to TikTok, which Trump saw as “a supposed threat, so he removed it from app stores.” Of course, that prevented consumers from installing updates, which has resulted in a constant churn of vulnerabilities and patches. The lack of understanding ""puts everyone at risk,” said Messdaghi, noting the importance of app updates to consumer device security. In fairness, many presidents might lack the full scope of understanding needed to grasp trickle down impact of cyber policies. As the saying goes, that's why they have advisers. Unfortunately, significant loss of brain trust around cyber at the White House came during Trump's first term. As DHS grew and shape-shifted, much of the security expertise moved to the “outer boroughs,” without the ear of the president, Messdaghi said. At the same time, the role of White House cybersecurity coordinator was eliminated by John Bolton, and former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson removed the State Department's Office of The Coordinator of Cyber Issues, which focused on U.S. diplomatic efforts. Political influence While the hope is that cybersecurity will “stay pretty apolitical in the scheme of things,” over the next four years, according to Kiersten Todt, managing director at the Cyber Readiness Institute, it’s not immune to politics. Initiatives like cyber moon shot, currently under the guidance of Vice President Mike Pence, will continue, says Tom Patterson, chief trust officer at Unisys and the co-lead of the President’s National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee’s Cyber Moonshot Subcommittee. Of more concern is how political jockeying may impact the way the U.S. deals with cyber threats from abroad. The president won praise for his crackdown on Huawei, but lifted sanctions on ZTE, which had prompted similar concerns to those raised by Huawei among members of Congress and the security community. Difficult to determine is whether those actions were based on security policy, or a desire influence trade negotiations with China. Consider too how the president courted authoritarians like North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and Russian President Vladmir Putin. He removed the sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2016 U.S. election, imposed by President Obama. On the point of that interference, the president has reserved judgement of Putin, who denies Russian meddling, and disputed findings of the U.S. intelligence community. At the same time, U.S. isolation and cooling relations with allies has left a leadership void in the global fight against cybersecurity threats. And collaboration among countries, cybersecurity experts agree, is a must if cyberattacks are to be curbed. The U.S. must work with allies, says Todt to develop a three-pronged approach for dealing with nation-states: “how do we cooperate with them; how do we compete with them; how do we confront them.” Trump past and potential successes Among the key Trump administration cybersecurity wins: the launch of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The agency has thrived under the leadership of Christopher Krebs, who Reiber calls “an immensely talented individual.” Other successes, Reiber says, include U.S. Cyber Command's “‘defend forward’ campaign to blunt and disrupt adversary operations on adversary networks before they can attack U.S. interests, an achievement in importance which cannot be overstated.” The administration can also tout “a number of regulatory and legislative initiatives [that] have come to the fore that could positively impact U.S. cybersecurity,"" including the Defense Department’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model, Reiber said. He expects progress there to continue, whoever gains the White House after this election.  Within those successes lie the potential for future progress, should there be another Trump term. Todt would hope the president could build on his success with CISA, for example, applying similar discipline to the reimagining of DHS, which is in desperate need of a makeover. “A re-examination of how DHS is organized: why it was created the way it was, why it doesn’t work, and how to make it as efficient as necessary,” she says. “If [he] got CISA through two years ago,” she explains, the success can be repeated. “CISA needs to be DHS,” forming more of a foundation for the department. Beyond that, clarity into Trump’s priorities going forward are best reflected in his budget proposals. And there, signals are not encouraging. “Looking at the budget, President Trump zero’d out cybersecurity funding in 2018,"" Messdaghi said. ""Cybersecurity costs money, and most Americans  are just as concerned at this point about cyberattacks as nukes – the former being far more frequent, and the later of course uniquely terrifying. ""To determine the Administration’s priorities and its talk vs. action, follow the money,"" she continued. ""Zero’d out is a clear compelling statement of priorities.”",three month first term flourish pen presid donald trump sign execut order ostens lay groundwork futur cybersecur polici american go poll

123,,More CISOs Could Be Hit By Data Regulations With New California Privacy Law,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31725/More-CISOs-Could-Be-Hit-By-Data-Regulations-With-New-California-Privacy-Law.html,"/11/3,","UPDATE: California passed ballot measure Proposition 24, the California Privacy Rights Act, Nov. 3. Californians will decide tomorrow whether to enact new regulatory rules in a ballot initiative dubbed the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). The CPRA, viewed by supporters as a patch for loopholes in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), would create several new wrinkles for security and privacy personnel to iron out, said Bret Cohen, partner in the privacy and cybersecurity practice at Hogan Lovells.  The CPRA, which would take effect in 2023, expands the coverage of the CCPA to include companies that make money sharing private data rather than just those selling it. It explicitly expands regulations to cross-context advertisements. It creates rights for consumers to correct information, opt out of automated decision making, and limit the disclosure of ""sensitive"" data – a new classification of data. The law also creates a California Privacy Protection Agency to oversee privacy regulation. ""The amount that it will force CISOs to change practices depends on how many of the new rights they intersect with. If you don't do many of these things, you won't likely have to change as much,"" Cohen said. Also, if passed, an interesting quirk in CPRA will make it more difficult to address problems with the law, should any arise. CPRA explicitly limits the ability of elected officials to narrow the provisions. ""If down the line there's a problem, that's ultimately bad for businesses. And maybe even bad for democracy,"" he said. The purpose of the provision reflects a belief in some privacy communities that the state will likely defang the bill to appease corporate interests otherwise. With the expanded scope of CPRA, experts warn that businesses who had not before needed to comply with other regulatory regimes like CCPA or the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union may need to make significant changes. ""Many small to midsize organizations that do not already have a robust GDPR compliance regimen in place (and may not have needed one) may need to make more substantial changes to be compliant,"" said Jeremy Turner, head of threat intelligence at Coalition, an insurance company that offers GDPR and CCPA policies. Nonetheless, for the benefit of consumers, Turner said he hoped the bill would pass. But he does acknowledge the need for the new agency to offering guidance to businesses in how to avoid fines, and (more importantly) how to avoid breaches. ""While strong measures to mandate data protection standards and protect consumer privacy are welcome initiatives, this proposition may be advancing punitive measures and financial liability in lieu of much needed guidance and industry collaboration,"" he said. CPRA is not just the latest privacy standard to be introduced in California, but the latest state privacy standard in a country quickly dividing into a patchwork of 50 separate state privacy policies. States from New York to Hawaii to North Dakota already offer bespoke state laws. Business groups have argued that consumers and businesses would be better served with one overriding federal privacy standard. States, however, have expressed some concern that a federal law may force them to remove protections they have already put in place. ""Every business, regardless of the state they are located in, deserves clear, national guidelines on how to manage data to best serve the needs of their customers,"" argued Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ""Congress must pass national data privacy legislation that protects all Americans equally and eliminates a confusing patchwork of state laws.""",updat california pass ballot measur proposit california privaci right act nov californian decid tomorrow whether enact new regulatori rule ballot initi dub california privaci right act cpra cpra view support patch loophol california consum privaci act ccpa would creat sever new wrinkl secur privaci personnel iron said bret cohen partner privaci cybersecur practic hogan lovel cpra would take effect expand coverag ccpa includ compani make money share privat data rather sell explicit expand regul crosscontext advertis creat right consum correct inform opt autom decis make limit disclosur sensit data – new classif data law also creat california privaci protect agenc overse privaci regul amount forc ciso chang practic depend mani new right intersect nt mani thing wo nt like chang much cohen said also pass interest quirk cpra make difficult address problem law aris cpra explicit limit abil elect offici narrow provis line s problem s ultim bad busi mayb even bad democraci said purpos provis reflect belief privaci communiti state like defang bill appeas corpor interest otherwis expand scope cpra expert warn busi need compli regulatori regim like ccpa general data protect regul european union may need make signific chang mani small midsiz organ alreadi robust gdpr complianc regimen place may need one may need make substanti chang compliant said jeremi turner head threat intellig coalit insur compani offer gdpr ccpa polici nonetheless benefit consum turner said hope bill would pas acknowledg need new agenc offer guidanc busi avoid fine import avoid breach strong measur mandat data protect standard protect consum privaci welcom initi proposit may advanc punit measur financi liabil lieu much need guidanc industri collabor said cpra latest privaci standard introduc california latest state privaci standard countri quick divid patchwork separ state privaci polici state new york hawaii north dakota alreadi offer bespok state law busi group argu consum busi would better serv one overrid feder privaci standard state howev express concern feder law may forc remov protect alreadi put place everi busi regardless state locat deserv clear nation guidelin manag data best serv need custom argu tom quaadman execut vice presid u chamber commerc congress must pas nation data privaci legisl protect american equal elimin confus patchwork state law ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
124,,Wroba Mobile Banking Trojan Targets US Smartphones,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31721/Wroba-Mobile-Banking-Trojan-Targets-US-Smartphones.html,"/11/2,","Kaspersky’s threat monitoring system has detected a new wave of Wroba trojan activity targeting smartphone users in the United States. Until Friday, attacks by the Wroba mobile banking trojan were limited mostly to Asia. According to details Kaspersky released to the media, the new wave in the U.S. was detected Oct. 29 and targeted users in a variety of U.S. states, including Connecticut, Louisiana and Wisconsin. The attacks hit both iOS and Android devices. The cybercriminals tried to attract users by notifying them of a parcel arrival and a text that said: “Your parcel has been sent out. Please check and accept it.” Next, it took them to a malicious site that shows an alert saying that the user’s browser is out of date and needs updating. Once a user clicks “OK” the malicious app downloads.   After the malicious app installs on the user’s mobile device, Wroba can send SMS messages, open web pages, get files from folders related to financial transactions, steal contact lists, call specified numbers and show fake phishing pages to steal the victim’s credentials. Kaspersky products detect the threat as Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Wroba.g. Kaspersky researchers say more than 1,000 users faced Trojan-Dropper.AndroidOS.Wroba.g since the start of the year. The countries hit the hardest include Russia, Japan and China. While the U.S. does not sit at the top of the attack list, Kaspersky researchers believe cybercriminals are heading to North America and the number of Wroba infections will increase. Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions at Lookout, said malware delivery attacks like the one Kaspersky reported have become much more common than credential harvesting. He added that according to Lookout data, 88 percent of U.S., consumer phishing attacks so far in 2020 were attempts to deliver malware to a mobile device. “Trojans like Wroba pose a significant threat to both consumer and enterprise users,” Schless said. “A mobile trojan can be built to access everything on your device and will not discriminate between personal and corporate data.”  Kaspersky recommends following these rules to protect mobile devices:",kasperski threat monitor system detect new wave wroba trojan activ target smartphon user unit state friday attack wroba mobil bank trojan limit most asia accord detail kasperski releas medium new wave u detect oct target user varieti u state includ connecticut louisiana wisconsin attack hit io android devic cybercrimin tri attract user notifi parcel arriv text said parcel sent pleas check accept it next took malici site show alert say user browser date need updat user click ok malici app download malici app instal user mobil devic wroba send sm messag open web page get file folder relat financi transact steal contact list call specifi number show fake phish page steal victim credenti kasperski product detect threat trojandropperandroidoswrobag kasperski research say user face trojandropperandroidoswrobag sinc start year countri hit hardest includ russia japan china u sit top attack list kasperski research believ cybercrimin head north america number wroba infect increas hank schless senior manag secur solut lookout said malwar deliveri attack like one kasperski report becom much common credenti harvest ad accord lookout data percent u consum phish attack far attempt deliv malwar mobil devic trojan like wroba pose signific threat consum enterpris user schless said mobil trojan built access everyth devic discrimin person corpor data kasperski recommend follow rule protect mobil devic ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'bank', 'usa', 'virus', 'phone', 'russia', 'google']"
125,,Experian's GDPR Fine Leaves Companies Scrambling,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31717/Experians-GDPR-Fine-Leaves-Companies-Scrambling.html,30/10/2020,"A General Data Protection Regulation enforcement notice from United Kingdom regulators could leave credit reporting giant Experian on the hook for as much as $24 million – baffling U.S. and European Union companies alike, say legal experts. The investigation that led to the notice found issues in each of the big three credit reporting agencies, and the data brokerage economy in general. While Experian, TransUnion and Equifax received praise for working with regulators on several of the problems apparently endemic to the industry, Experian reportedly failed to meet all its requests. An enforcement notice is a warning that a fine will come should a company not take action. Experian now has nine months to do so, pending appeal. The key issue flagged in the Experian enforcement is one that all companies that handle data from brokers need to consider when establishing data privacy practices. “At a high level, the issue is transparency. It’s one of the key pillars of data protection,” said Sarah Pearce, an attorney at Paul Hastings' London offices. “You need a lawful basis for each use of data.” In GDPR, there are several categories of ways to legally obtain data. Companies can outright the users for permission to store and process data, for example. Or, companies can claim “legitimate interest,"" where the data use is necessary for business purposes that aren’t seen as threats to privacy. Direct marketing via mail is considered legitimate interest. But, in this case, the consent to use the data had been received by a broker that hadn’t specified the data would be sold. That negates the buyer (in this case Experian) being able to claim direct marketing as a legitimate interest. “Because consent to use data was obtained by a broker, you are confusing users,” said Federica De Santis, an attorney with Goodwin’s privacy and cybersecurity practice. This enforcement notice covers physical mail. De Santis notes that email marketing is governed by an entirely different standard that always requires consent. For companies who use data brokers, De Santis advises first doing due diligence on a firm’s consent practices and not relying solely on contracts. She also suggests following guidance from the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office for companies who deal with data brokers. Companies within the direct marketing industry say they are doing their best to meet those demands. “For this space to continue to flourish, public trust is imperative, and so companies must act as responsible stewards of data,” said John Story, vice president and deputy general council at Acoustic, a cloud platform used to manage direct marketing data. Acoustic created an office for a chief data ethics officer, he added.   Many privacy officers applauded the ICO notice. “We need more rulings like this to set the tone that people and their privacy matters,” said Alok Ojha, vice president of security, privacy, & compliance products at cloud content management company Box. The ICO report mentions that all three of the credit reporting bureaus worked with investigators to address problems during the investigation. TransUnion and Equifax withdrew products and services to become fully compliant. The fact that the ICO didn’t need to issue notices to TransUnion or Equifax and that neither firm is currently at risk of being fined shouldn’t slip the attention of companies, said Shane McNamee, chief privacy officer of the cybersecurity firm Avast and a former regulator with the Data Protection Commission of Ireland. “I think what’s more interesting than the potential fine to one credit reporting agency is that two credit reporting agencies did the remediation required by the regulators, and didn’t get enforcement notices,” he said. McNamee said that while many companies might see the potential fines as a cost of doing business in Europe, they should be aware that the real regulatory power comes from their ability to ban business practices altogether. It's always more prudent, therefore, to take the time to work with lawyers during the engineering process rather than to be forced to rebuild from scratch after a regulator weighs in. Other key strategies to stave off regulatory enforcement include accounting for a shifting landscape of GDPR requirements, said said Bridget Treacy, the attorney heading the U.K. privacy practice of Hunton Andrews Kurth. “Organizations need to review their GDPR compliance programs on an ongoing basis, ""she said. ""What might have been fine when the GDPR took effect on May 25, 2018 may well be out of date by now.""",general data protect regul enforc notic unit kingdom regul could leav credit report giant experian hook much million – baffl u european union compani alik say legal expert investig led notic found issu big three credit report agenc data brokerag economi general experian transunion equifax receiv prais work regul sever problem appar endem industri experian report fail meet request enforc notic warn fine come compani take action experian nine month pend appeal key issu flag experian enforc one compani handl data broker need consid establish data privaci practic high level issu transpar one key pillar data protect said sarah pearc attorney paul hast london offic need law basi use data gdpr sever categori way legal obtain data compani outright user permiss store process data exampl compani claim legitim interest data use necessari busi purpos seen threat privaci direct market via mail consid legitim interest case consent use data receiv broker specifi data would sold negat buyer case experian abl claim direct market legitim interest consent use data obtain broker confus user said federica de santi attorney goodwin privaci cybersecur practic enforc notic cover physic mail de santi note email market govern entir differ standard alway requir consent compani use data broker de santi advis first due dilig firm consent practic reli sole contract also suggest follow guidanc uk s inform commission s offic compani deal data broker compani within direct market industri say best meet demand space continu flourish public trust imper compani must act respons steward data said john stori vice presid deputi general council acoust cloud platform use manag direct market data acoust creat offic chief data ethic offic ad mani privaci offic applaud ico notic need rule like set tone peopl privaci matter said alok ojha vice presid secur privaci complianc product cloud content manag compani box ico report mention three credit report bureau work investig address problem investig transunion equifax withdrew product servic becom fulli compliant fact ico need issu notic transunion equifax neither firm current risk fine slip attent compani said shane mcname chief privaci offic cybersecur firm avast former regul data protect commiss ireland think interest potenti fine one credit report agenc two credit report agenc remedi requir regul get enforc notic said mcname said mani compani might see potenti fine cost busi europ awar real regulatori power come abil ban busi practic altogeth s alway prudent therefor take time work lawyer engin process rather forc rebuild scratch regul weigh key strategi stave regulatori enforc includ account shift landscap gdpr requir said said bridget treaci attorney head uk privaci practic hunton andrew kurth organ need review gdpr complianc program ongo basi said might fine gdpr took effect may may well date ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
126,,Five Eyes Renews Calls For Backdoors In Security Products,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31659/Five-Eyes-Renews-Calls-For-Backdoors-In-Security-Products.html,13/10/2020,"Federal law enforcement agencies from the U.S. and several of its closest allies cosigned a statement over the weekend calling for tech manufacturers to provide law enforcement personnel a mechanism to pierce through encryption whenever necessary. The statement ""calls on technology companies to work with governments to ...embed the safety of the public in system designs, thereby enabling companies to act against illegal content and activity effectively with no reduction to safety, and facilitating the investigation and prosecution of offences and safeguarding the vulnerable,"" noting that encryption could potentially thwart investigations into child exploitation and other online crime. The long-held debate pitting law enforcement against security researchers, tech companies, consumers, security vendors and companies with data to secure will soon enter its fourth decade. The statement released this weekend did not include any new arguments. But there was a new twist. In addition to being signed by law enforcement leaders of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand) the statement by two new allies ""Japan"" and ""India"" — though not any specific person from either nation. ""It's really just the same old call for backdoors with all the problems of a call for backdoors,"" said Ryan Polk, senior policy advisor with the Internet Society,  an internet standards development and open internet advocacy body. The problem is that mechanisms for law enforcement to circumvent encryption inherently weaken security by adding an additional layer of access and potential human error. The reality is that the CIA, NSA, Apple, Microsoft, and several law-enforcement agencies have all had substantial leaks of securely held data over just the past five years. ""You can't have security without secure end-to-end encryption, whether that's national security, vulnerable populations or businesses protecting intellectual property, employees or customers,"" said Polk. Polk noted there are a variety of ways for determining law enforcement to get the same information without intentionally building exceptional access into secure products. In the El Chapo case and the recent Michigan plot to kidnap the governor, police were able to obtain encrypted messages by cultivating an informant with access. Several contractors are available to hack devices for law enforcement, providing the same access to a device as a backdoor, as Cellebrite reportedly did when it cracked an iPhone belonging to the San Bernardino, Calif. shooter for the FBI in 2016. And for all the newly encrypted communications, there are even more new sources of information that aren't encrypted, including IoT devices, pervasive video cameras in public, license plate trackers and boatloads of metadata. While the DOJ has been consistent about its desire for exceptional access, this new call comes just before a presidential election determining Attorney General Bill Barr's future. That may cause vendors to lend less credence to the demand, after already remaining pretty steadfast in its position on the issue previously. ""It's unlikely that makers of encrypted devices or services are going to change their stance on this issue based on this letter or at this time,"" said Greg Nojeim, senior counsel for the Center for Democracy & Society.",feder law enforc agenc u sever closest alli cosign statement weekend call tech manufactur provid law enforc personnel mechan pierc encrypt whenev necessari statement call technolog compani work govern emb safeti public system design therebi enabl compani act illeg content activ effect reduct safeti facilit investig prosecut offenc safeguard vulner note encrypt could potenti thwart investig child exploit onlin crime longheld debat pit law enforc secur research tech compani consum secur vendor compani data secur soon enter fourth decad statement releas weekend includ new argument new twist addit sign law enforc leader five eye intellig allianc u uk canada australia new zealand statement two new alli japan india — though specif person either nation s realli old call backdoor problem call backdoor said ryan polk senior polici advisor internet societi internet standard develop open internet advocaci bodi problem mechan law enforc circumv encrypt inher weaken secur ad addit layer access potenti human error realiti cia nsa appl microsoft sever lawenforc agenc substanti leak secur held data past five year ca nt secur without secur endtoend encrypt whether s nation secur vulner popul busi protect intellectu properti employe custom said polk polk note varieti way determin law enforc get inform without intent build except access secur product el chapo case recent michigan plot kidnap governor polic abl obtain encrypt messag cultiv inform access sever contractor avail hack devic law enforc provid access devic backdoor cellebrit report crack iphon belong san bernardino calif shooter fbi newli encrypt communic even new sourc inform nt encrypt includ iot devic pervas video camera public licens plate tracker boatload metadata doj consist desir except access new call come presidenti elect determin attorney general bill barr s futur may caus vendor lend le credenc demand alreadi remain pretti steadfast posit issu previous s unlik maker encrypt devic servic go chang stanc issu base letter time said greg nojeim senior counsel center democraci societi ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'canada', 'britain', 'australia', 'spyware', 'backdoor', 'new zealand']"
127,,"Zoom Tries To Make Good On Security, Privacy Promises",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31636/Zoom-Tries-To-Make-Good-On-Security-Privacy-Promises.html,"/10/5,","After a massive boom in use and a rocky start as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world, Zoom has completed its ambitious 90-day security and privacy plan, most recently adding two-factor authentication (2FA) to its roster of protective measures. The 2FA, as well as the addition of former Salesforce executive Jason Lee as chief information security officer, seem to be steps by Zoom to respond to criticism piled on the teleconferencing platform for shortcoming that led to “zoom bombing,” zero day vulnerabilities being sold on the market by bug brokers, and other privacy missteps. As part of its ongoing efforts, the company has built a robust bug bounty program on the Bugcrowd platform. Bugcrowd CEO Ashish Gupta spoke with SC Media about the program and the strides he believes Zoom has made to protect data and privacy. What does Zoom’s embrace of two-factor authentication mean in the company’s strategy for improving its privacy and data security posture? Zoom announced enhanced two factor authentication for desktop and mobile, which adds an extra layer of protection and shields personal information.  We are making a lot of advances in the use of cyber technologies in our day-to-day life and Zoom has become a big part of our lives – both personally and professionally. This extra layer of security not only overcomes the strength of your passwords, it’s also easy to implement and adds another layer of security. 2FA gives nefarious actors an additional hurdle before they can access your information or Zoom meeting.   Bugcrowd runs Zoom’s bug bounty program. How has the company invested in growing that program?  Zoom is very active with their bug bounty program and has been responsive to researcher and Bugcrowd feedback. They have hired additional experts with vast experience in bug bounty programs to help manage their internal processes and further benefit from the power of the security researchers submitting on their bug bounty program.   Zoom continues to be a supporter of the crowdsourced approach and of all the researchers who provide such critical feedback. By utilizing researchers to continuously test their platform for vulnerabilities, Zoom reaps the benefits of the ‘human touch’ or ‘human ingenuity.’ This allows Zoom to get more visibility into their attack surface, as the contextual visibility that ethical hackers contribute is vital. We have seen Zoom move to actively address all [vulnerabilities] submitted by Bugcrowd’s researchers. AI is expected to make a significant difference in managing risk. Does that make the human element less important? While AI and other security solutions have a role in reducing cyber risk, human ingenuity is also important in achieving an effective security posture. Our white hat hackers can perform vulnerability  testing that can identify vulnerabilities within apps on a continual basis. One of the best ways to beat an attacker is by thinking like one. At the end of the day, speed can be the enemy of security as everyone wants to get their products to market faster. However, if more companies like Zoom can make security a key part of the software development lifecycle and take the input of the crowd, the benefits can be immense.  After getting hammered early on Zoom acknowledged concerns and came out with a detailed proactive 90-day security and privacy plan for addressing security and privacy issues. What are the long-term implications on the company’s bug bounty program? I would reaffirm that Zoom’s efforts to utilize the power of crowdsourced security and the bug bounty program are not a 'once and done’ deal. Zoom has seen a huge increase in usage, and helped Zoom become more secure. We do this in a number of ways and one very powerful method is that we match the right researchers to the right use case. For instance, Zoom works on multiple end-points with multiple operating systems and browsers, calendars, environments, APIs, etc. Having a team of researchers who collectively understand those environments makes it easier to find security vulnerabilities in any individual area or at handoff points. The benefit of the crowd and our platform is that we create a force-multiplier driven by bringing experts to work together and a platform that provides contextual intelligence that helps find and fix security vulnerabilities faster. Zoom takes this force multiplier seriously and welcomes researchers to submit vulnerabilities on our platform with the goal to make the Zoom connected world safer. They continue to make SecOps a key part of the DevOps and overall software development lifecycle and benefit from the feedback of our crowd, which helps them deliver even more secure communications to the world.   We see that Zoom is in this for the long run and applaud those efforts.",massiv boom use rocki start covid pandem swept world zoom complet ambiti day secur privaci plan recent ad twofactor authent fa roster protect measur fa well addit former salesforc execut jason lee chief inform secur offic seem step zoom respond critic pile teleconferenc platform shortcom led zoom bomb zero day vulner sold market bug broker privaci misstep part ongo effort compani built robust bug bounti program bugcrowd platform bugcrowd ceo ashish gupta spoke sc medium program stride belief zoom made protect data privaci zoom embrac twofactor authent mean compani strategi improv privaci data secur postur zoom announc enhanc two factor authent desktop mobil add extra layer protect shield person inform make lot advanc use cyber technolog daytoday life zoom becom big part life – person profession extra layer secur overcom strength password also easi implement add anoth layer secur fa give nefari actor addit hurdl access inform zoom meet bugcrowd run zoom bug bounti program compani invest grow program zoom activ bug bounti program respons research bugcrowd feedback hire addit expert vast experi bug bounti program help manag intern process benefit power secur research submit bug bounti program zoom continu support crowdsourc approach research provid critic feedback util research continu test platform vulner zoom reap benefit ‘ human touch ‘ human ingenu allow zoom get visibl attack surfac contextu visibl ethic hacker contribut vital seen zoom move activ address vulner submit bugcrowd research ai expect make signific differ manag risk make human element le import ai secur solut role reduc cyber risk human ingenu also import achiev effect secur postur white hat hacker perform vulner test identifi vulner within app continu basi one best way beat attack think like one end day speed enemi secur everyon want get product market faster howev compani like zoom make secur key part softwar develop lifecycl take input crowd benefit immens get hammer earli zoom acknowledg concern came detail proactiv day secur privaci plan address secur privaci issu longterm implic compani bug bounti program would reaffirm zoom effort util power crowdsourc secur bug bounti program onc done deal zoom seen huge increas usag help zoom becom secur number way one power method match right research right use case instanc zoom work multipl endpoint multipl oper system browser calendar environ api etc team research collect understand environ make easier find secur vulner individu area handoff point benefit crowd platform creat forcemultipli driven bring expert work togeth platform provid contextu intellig help find fix secur vulner faster zoom take forc multipli serious welcom research submit vulner platform goal make zoom connect world safer continu make secop key part devop overal softwar develop lifecycl benefit feedback crowd help deliv even secur communic world see zoom long run applaud effort ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'phone', 'flaw']"
128,,Leaked FinCEN Files Expose Poor Data Security,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31603/Leaked-FinCEN-Files-Expose-Poor-Data-Security.html,23/09/2020,"Leaked documents, dubbed the “FinCEN Files,” describe global money laundering of $2 trillion processed by many of the world’s biggest banks between 2000 and 2017. The reveal  illuminates the struggle for the financial industry and government to provide ironclad data protection. “This sensational and unprecedented leak clearly demonstrates a wide spectrum of data protection weaknesses in the governmental sector, affecting even the most developed Western countries,” Ilia Kolochenko, founder and CEO of  ImmuniWeb, said of the files. “From a cybersecurity standpoint, we may expect a growing lack of trust to governmental agencies, which on one side have quasi-unlimited access to the most sensitive data of the largest organizations, while cannot duly safeguard this data on the other side,” he said. The latest disclosure exposing apparently insufficient attempts by the public and private sectors to curb corruption came to light in a BuzzFeed News report which detailed more than 2,500 reported cases, including 2,100 Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) filed by financial institutions with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Standard Chartered are among the financial institutions cited in the leaked files as processing dirty money around the world. The documents may have come from a whistleblower or insider at FinCEN. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which represents 108 news organizations in 88 countries, is conducting a probe of the matter. Other similar investigative reports on similar wrongdoing focused single financial, tax or legal institutions, such as the 2017 Panama Papers emanating from clients of the law firm Mossack Fonseca. But the FinCEN docs reveal that a wide array of people from oligarchs and corrupt politicians to drug dealers and organized crime throughout the world know how to circumvent the system’s supposed checks and balances. To restore confidence, Kolochenko said, calling for a transparent investigation to restore confidence. FinCEN on Sept. 16 solicited comments solicit public comments due in 60 days on a wide range of questions pertaining to potential regulatory amendments under the Bank Secrecy Act, including FinCEN’s Strategic Anti-Money Laundering Priorities. “While this event will further erode the public’s trust in both financial institutions and the government entities tasked with overseeing them, it's likely to just become something that generates noise, but no real changes that will cause any lasting impact,” commented Erich Kron, security awareness advocate with KnowBe4. The most obvious ramification for the government is the loss of trust from the citizens in the ability to protect sensitive information, he added. As privacy concerns and the individual’s knowledge of the digital footprint everyone generates increases, Kron believes it will become even more difficult for government to pass further laws requiring the use of personal information. Corporations are also likely to suffer. “Looking at the current headlines related to these leaked documents, you can clearly see how just the fact that they allowed transfers of suspect funds, even though it was reported, is now being used to show them in a negative light,” Kron said. With respect to organizations, getting them to report suspected activities will only become more difficult when these sensitive documents that they are supposed to protect are made public, reflecting on the reputation and image of the organization,” he added. “Internal actors exist in many of these organizations who are willing to continually look the other way,” commented Thomas Hatch, CTO and Co-Founder at SaltStack. “Often, it’s the level of financial reliance on the inflow of funds that enables the level of widespread abuse seen in these cases,” he added. When large sums of money are flowing, it is easy to allow the abuse to continue – the flow of these funds can have a positive impact on legitimate business. “It’s very Machiavellian – less than ethical leaders are willing to allow these abuses to continue,” Hatch said. What is most concerning to him is that when funds at this scale are being moved around, the nature of potential security issues becomes exponentially more complicated, he added. From a legal standpoint, Kolochenko said the organizations and other entities cited in the Buzzfeed research, may have a cause of action against many parties potentially accountable for negligent data protection and possible non-compliance with the enacted data protection laws. “However, the chances to prevail in a court of law are fairly small,” Kolochenko admitted. “Moreover, given the extremely delicate and toxic nature of the exposed documents, they are better to discreetly settle the matter,” he said, predicting a further hardening of data protection laws that could “dramatically exacerbate the situation if implemented too rapidly or overbroadly.” On Sept. 1, in response to expected media reports resulting from the BuzzFeed story, FinCEN issued a press release that stated the “unauthorized disclosure of SARs is a crime that can impact the national security of the United States, compromise law enforcement investigations, and threaten the safety and security of the institutions and individuals who file such reports.” FinCEN said it referred this matter to the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Inspector General. Buzzfeed did not make available the actual SARs in Wikileaks style, but rather described their contents. In a case related to the Panama Papers, the Justice Department on Sept. 21 reported a former U.S. resident and taxpayer was sentenced in the Southern District of New York to four years in prison for wire fraud, tax fraud, money laundering, false statements, and other charges. ",leak document dub fincen file describ global money launder trillion process mani world biggest bank reveal illumin struggl financi industri govern provid ironclad data protect sensat unpreced leak clear demonstr wide spectrum data protect weak government sector affect even develop western countri ilium kolochenko founder ceo immuniweb said file cybersecur standpoint may expect grow lack trust government agenc one side quasiunlimit access sensit data largest organ duli safeguard data side said latest disclosur expos appar insuffici attempt public privat sector curb corrupt came light buzzfe news report detail report case includ suspici activ report sar file financi institut u treasuri depart financi crime enforc network fincen jpmorgan chase citigroup bank america deutsch bank hsbc standard charter among financi institut cite leak file process dirti money around world document may come whistleblow insid fincen intern consortium investig journalist icij repres news organ countri conduct probe matter similar investig report similar wrongdo focus singl financi tax legal institut panama paper eman client law firm mossack fonseca fincen doc reveal wide array peopl oligarch corrupt politician drug dealer organ crime throughout world know circumv system suppos check balanc restor confid kolochenko said call transpar investig restor confid fincen sept solicit comment solicit public comment due day wide rang question pertain potenti regulatori amend bank secreci act includ fincen strateg antimoney launder prioriti event erod public trust financi institut govern entiti task overse s like becom someth generat nois real chang caus last impact comment erich kron secur awar advoc knowb obvious ramif govern loss trust citizen abil protect sensit inform ad privaci concern individu knowledg digit footprint everyon generat increas kron belief becom even difficult govern pas law requir use person inform corpor also like suffer look current headlin relat leak document clear see fact allow transfer suspect fund even though report use show negat light kron said respect organ get report suspect activ becom difficult sensit document suppos protect made public reflect reput imag organ ad intern actor exist mani organ will continu look way comment thoma hatch cto cofound saltstack often level financi relianc inflow fund enabl level widespread abus seen case ad larg sum money flow easi allow abus continu – flow fund posit impact legitim busi machiavellian – le ethic leader will allow abus continu hatch said concern fund scale move around natur potenti secur issu becom exponenti complic ad legal standpoint kolochenko said organ entiti cite buzzfe research may caus action mani parti potenti account neglig data protect possibl noncompli enact data protect law howev chanc prevail court law fair small kolochenko admit moreov given extrem delic toxic natur expos document better discreet settl matter said predict harden data protect law could dramat exacerb situat implement rapid overbroad sept respons expect medium report result buzzfe stori fincen issu press releas state unauthor disclosur sar crime impact nation secur unit state compromis law enforc investig threaten safeti secur institut individu file report fincen said refer matter u depart justic u depart treasuri offic inspector general buzzfe make avail actual sar wikileak style rather describ content case relat panama paper justic depart sept report former u resid taxpay sentenc southern district new york four year prison wire fraud tax fraud money launder fals statement charg ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'data loss', 'fraud']"
129,,FBI Opens China-Related Counter Intelligence Case Every 10 Hours,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31586/FBI-Opens-China-Related-Counter-Intelligence-Case-Every-10-Hours.html,18/09/2020,"FBI Director Christopher Wray today offered the House Homeland Security Committee some sobering news about China: the FBI opens a new China-related counterintelligence case roughly every 10 hours. Wray said of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases underway across the U.S., almost half are related to China. He said China aims to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions conducing important COVID-19 research. “They are going after cost and pricing information, internal strategy documents, personally identifiable information – anything that can give them a competitive advantage,” Wray told House members this morning. Wray also said the FBI has become worried about a “wider-than-ever” range of threat actors – from multinational cyber syndicates to nation-state adversaries. And they are concerned that these threat actors are targeting managed service providers (MSPs) as a way of attacking multiple victims by hacking just one provider. The FBI Director added that China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) pioneered the MSP attack technique and said in July the FBI indicted two Chinese hackers who worked with the Guangdong State Security Department of the MSS. The Chinese hackers conducted a hacking campaign that lasted more than 10 years, targeting countries with high technology industries. The sectors they hit included solar energy, pharmaceuticals and defense.  “Cybercrimes like these, directed by the Chinese government’s intelligence services, threaten not only the United States, but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and they also seriously undermine China’s desire to become a respected leader in world affairs,” Wray said in his written testimony. Kennan Skelly, CEO at shyftED, said there’s really nothing new about the Chinese MSPs, adding that DHS has been picking up activity by Red Apollo (Advanced Persistent Threat 10) since 2014 with the Cloud Hopper campaign.    “MSPs are a rich target as they service many companies that fit into the 10 sectors of Chinese interest,” Skelly said. Skelly said while MSPs aim to relieve the strain on organizations that cannot or do not want to manage their security in-house, they are equally at risk. For example, having dedicated teams and tools to protect customer organizations doesn’t mean they can lock everything down at a customer. “Even with the right security detection and mitigation in place it only takes one employee to click on a phishing or spear phishing email to allow threat actors in,” Skelly said. “Red Apollo has had great success using both of those tactics over many years. The most crucial defense we have is still the human line of defense, and sadly that still needs a lot of work.  Until organizations begin to take security awareness seriously these threat actors will continue to prevail.” Bob VanKirk, chief revenue officer at SonicWall, added that MSPs also need a single, centralized dashboard to more effectively manage customer networks. “With 62 percent of Americans still working remotely, many MSPs are challenged to manage multiple customer networks from afar,” VanKirk said. “Through a single platform that tracks all its customers at once, MSPs can simplify operations and identify the new types of threat vectors to help their customers be proactive rather than reactive about a cyberattack.”",fbi director christoph wray today offer hous homeland secur committe sober news china fbi open new chinarel counterintellig case rough everi hour wray said near activ fbi counterintellig case underway across u almost half relat china said china aim compromis american health care organ pharmaceut compani academ institut conduc import covid research go cost price inform intern strategi document person identifi inform – anyth give competit advantag wray told hous member morn wray also said fbi becom worri widerthanev rang threat actor – multin cyber syndic nationst adversari concern threat actor target manag servic provid msps way attack multipl victim hack one provid fbi director ad china ministri state secur ms pioneer msp attack techniqu said juli fbi indict two chines hacker work guangdong state secur depart ms chines hacker conduct hack campaign last year target countri high technolog industri sector hit includ solar energi pharmaceut defens cybercrim like direct chines govern intellig servic threaten unit state also everi countri support fair play intern norm rule law also serious undermin china desir becom respect leader world affair wray said written testimoni kennan skelli ceo shyft said realli noth new chines msps ad dhs pick activ red apollo advanc persist threat sinc cloud hopper campaign msps rich target servic mani compani fit sector chines interest skelli said skelli said msps aim reliev strain organ want manag secur inhous equal risk exampl dedic team tool protect custom organ mean lock everyth custom even right secur detect mitig place take one employe click phish spear phish email allow threat actor skelli said red apollo great success use tactic mani year crucial defens still human line defens sad still need lot work organ begin take secur awar serious threat actor continu prevail bob vankirk chief revenu offic sonicwal ad msps also need singl central dashboard effect manag custom network percent american still work remot mani msps challeng manag multipl custom network afar vankirk said singl platform track custom msps simplifi oper identifi new type threat vector help custom proactiv rather reactiv cyberattack ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'usa', 'china', 'data loss', 'cyberwar', 'fbi']"
130,,North Korean And Russian Cybercriminals Are Cooperating,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31583/North-Korean-And-Russian-Cybercriminals-Are-Cooperating.html,17/09/2020,"Several companies, media outlets and the U.S. government have accused North Korean state-sponsored hackers of purchasing access to pre-hacked servers from criminal groups. But the connections to specific criminal groups have been a little more tenuous. Now a new meta-analysis of previous reports from Intel 471 establish a likely connection to TrickBot. TrickBot, as well as Dridex and TA505, are groupings of attacks linked to different Russian-speaking cybercriminals who sell access to victims' machines in criminal forums. The North Korean Lazarus Group, which supplements an economy ravaged by sanctions with cybercrime, is known to use a variety of vectors to find initial access. ""I was skeptical about any North Korea / Russian criminal group links before writing this,"" said Intel 471 chief executive Mark Arena, who wrote the report. ""When open-source reporting is based on one or two instances of TrickBot and Lazarus in the same server, it's possible that they were two separate attacks."" Arena read through the various reporting on the overlap between criminal groups and Lazarus, contacted the researchers for information not contained in the reports and solicited additional information from other researchers. What he found was a very clear chain in the reports showing TrickBot infections leading to malware only used infrequently in Lazarus-type attacks, which appears to be developed by Lazarus using the group's fairly distinctive code. Public reporting was less sufficient. A purported connection to Dridex appeared to be a researcher conflating different criminal groups. And when Arena contacted a BAE researcher who had given a presentation proposing a connection between TA505 and Lazarus, that researcher said the presentation was only meant to be taken as a theory. However, in speaking with practitioners who hadn't made their work public, other people had independent suspicions of a link between the two that no longer appears to be active. Arena told SC Media that knowing there is a connection between different actors gives defenders a chance to investigate a potential second problem when the first one is found. He added that if North Korea is likely to purchase access from one actor, it is likely to be willing to purchase from others. The choice of vendors shouldn't be seen as set in stone.",sever compani medium outlet u govern accus north korean statesponsor hacker purchas access prehack server crimin group connect specif crimin group littl tenuous new metaanalysi previous report intel establish like connect trickbot trickbot well dridex ta group attack link differ russianspeak cybercrimin sell access victim machin crimin forum north korean lazarus group supplement economi ravag sanction cybercrim known use varieti vector find initi access skeptic north korea russian crimin group link write said intel chief execut mark arena wrote report opensourc report base one two instanc trickbot lazarus server s possibl two separ attack arena read various report overlap crimin group lazarus contact research inform contain report solicit addit inform research found clear chain report show trickbot infect lead malwar use infrequ lazarustyp attack appear develop lazarus use group s fair distinct code public report le suffici purport connect dridex appear research conflat differ crimin group arena contact bae research given present propos connect ta lazarus research said present meant taken theori howev speak practition nt made work public peopl independ suspicion link two longer appear activ arena told sc medium know connect differ actor give defend chanc investig potenti second problem first one found ad north korea like purchas access one actor like will purchas other choic vendor nt seen set stone ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'malware', 'russia', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'korea']"
131,,China Pushes New Global Data Security Initiative,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31556/China-Pushes-New-Global-Data-Security-Initiative.html,"/09/8,","China announced a comprehensive global data security program Tuesday, proposing many of the same international norms agreed upon by Western nations already, while protecting China's interest in balkanizing the internet. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi proposed the ""Global Data Security Initiative"" in a statement translated here by the New America think tank.  According to Wang, the goal of the initiative is to allow countries to operate their own legal regimes so long as all companies can enter markets under the same rules, all while globally protecting information security. The announcement comes after a global cohort of nations led by the United States have restricted or outright banned the use of Chinese telecommunication equipment manufacturer Huawei's wares in local 5G infrastructure. Huawei has been accused of a spate of grievances, including violating sanctions, aiding in Chinese economic espionage, and benefitting from the Chinese theft of foreign intellectual property.  Without mentioning Huawei by name, Wang comments implied that China's data initiative is, at least in part, in response to the current situation involving the manufacturer. ""Politicizing data security issues and applying double standards, even to the point of freely starting rumors to blacken others' names, violates basic principles of international relations and seriously disturbs and hinders global digital cooperation and development,"" said Wang in his statement. The Chinese plan is comprised of eight key points: The agreement would protect many of the controversial data practices of the Chinese government – including forcing companies to store China-related data on Chinese soil and widespread domestic surveillance. China is frequently accused of using hackers to steal intellectual property stored in foreign countries. Many of the points in the Global Data Security Initiative are not controversial.

132,,Lessons From 15 Years Of Bug Bounties,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31512/Lessons-From-15-Years-Of-Bug-Bounties.html,25/08/2020,"It is increasingly hard to remember a time when bug bounty programs, let alone disclosure programs, weren't so universally accepted.  These days, you'll find bounties for everything from branches of the military to your toaster. Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative, the largest vendor-agnostic bug bounty program in the world, was battle-hardened more than a decade before you could hack the Pentagon. They have purchased and disclosed vulnerabilities found by freelance hackers in everything from Windows to industrial control equipment. It’s one-part public service to help disclose vulnerabilities to manufacturers, one-part research service for defenders trying to get a head start on security gaps they will need to defend.   The Initiative celebrated 15 years this week. It has disclosed more than 7,500 vulnerabilities in its time, paying out more than $20 million. Its Pwn2Own competitions have become massive events.   SC Media talked with the Zero Day Initiative Director Brian Gorenc about how the project came to be, what the last 15 years have taught him about disclosure, and that time he inadvertently rendered NSA spy tools useless.   There’s a long, complicated history to bug bounty and disclosure programs. For a time, many industries were really hostile to researchers trying disclose vulnerabilities. Has that changed while ZDI has been around? Is this all normal now?   More common in the early days was companies not understanding what was happening when we disclosed vulnerabilities, when we did disclosures before Bugcrowd and HackerOne existed.  The bug bounty service companies are very, very common now and people understand this topic.    But being a vendor-agnostic bounty program can still be confusing. We run contests designed to mimic the vulnerability grey market. Pwn2Own supplies six-figure bounties for exploits against Google Chrome, virtualization technologies and Tesla. It's hard for some people to understand the business value around offering a bounty like that, especially when we're going to get the bugs patched immediately.  If we’re in Asia, people ask us if we’re buying vulnerabilities for the American government. If we’re in the EU, they ask us if we’re from Russia.  The program actually began as a way to kind of expand our research capabilities within our company, the idea being that we could only hire so many vulnerability researchers. We figured we could go out to the research community and try to crowdsource some of that intelligence information, to expand what we were able to cover and what types of protections we provide our customers.  I hear one of the problems disclosure programs run into is not being prepared to handle all the vulnerabilities that get sent in – that you need to have personnel in place to handle a flood of patching. We saw that up close. When we moved to Trend Micro after the acquisition of the Tipping Point IPS [which ZDI was a part of], that was the first thing I said to the executives. I was like, 'you now own the world's largest vendor-agnostic bug bounty program and that means the hackers who submit to it see a target on Trend Micro's software and researchers are going to look for vulnerabilities.' And to Trend Micro's credit, they handled that really really well. When we came in [Trend Micro] purchased a hundred different bugs in Trend Micro products within the first year.  Are there any ZDI disclosures that particularly stand out?  The one I find most interesting was in 2015, when we received a vulnerability that was supposedly a bypass for the .lnk vulnerability used in Stuxnet. The vulnerability used in Stuxnet  was one of the most popular vulnerabilities out there. It was looked at by everybody. But after that initial patch came out we received the bypass, which was unbelievable – the entire industry had been looking at this patch and nobody has noticed this bypass until [someone] submitted a full white paper with a full exploit. Microsoft patched it quickly and we didn't think much of it.   But then, two years later, the Vault 7 leaks [guidebooks for CIA hacking tools] came out. We learned that the bypass for the Stuxnet bug was actually being used by the agencies in a tool they called EZCHEESE and when the vulnerability was patched that they actually had to go develop a different tool. As disclosure programs have become more common, what mistakes do companies make trying to implement them?   We'll see a lot of companies that just won't respond at all. They'll advertise that they are accepting vulnerability disclosures through their security apps or some sort of thing, but they're actually not monitoring it.   Eventually, we’ll release the zero-day advisory and when it reaches the press, the vendor will reach out to us through various different mechanisms. We've had the chief marketing officer of a company reach out to us and ask what's going on. We've had low-level engineers reach out to us to figure out what's going on. But the actual response mechanism had failed.   Good communication is extremely important. One of the most valuable things is building a relationship with the researchers who are looking for security vulnerabilities. They really, really know technology, so they can give you a lot of help and guidance on security. ",increas hard rememb time bug bounti program let alon disclosur program nt univers accept day ll find bounti everyth branch militari toaster trend micro s zero day initi largest vendoragnost bug bounti program world battleharden decad could hack pentagon purchas disclos vulner found freelanc hacker everyth window industri control equip onepart public servic help disclos vulner manufactur onepart research servic defend tri get head start secur gap need defend initi celebr year week disclos vulner time pay million pwnown competit becom massiv event sc medium talk zero day initi director brian gorenc project came last year taught disclosur time inadvert render nsa spi tool useless long complic histori bug bounti disclosur program time mani industri realli hostil research tri disclos vulner chang zdi around normal common earli day compani understand happen disclos vulner disclosur bugcrowd hackeron exist bug bounti servic compani common peopl understand topic vendoragnost bounti program still confus run contest design mimic vulner grey market pwnown suppli sixfigur bounti exploit googl chrome virtual technolog tesla s hard peopl understand busi valu around offer bounti like especi re go get bug patch immedi asia peopl ask u buy vulner american govern eu ask u russia program actual began way kind expand research capabl within compani idea could hire mani vulner research figur could go research communiti tri crowdsourc intellig inform expand abl cover type protect provid custom hear one problem disclosur program run prepar handl vulner get sent – need personnel place handl flood patch saw close move trend micro acquisit tip point ip zdi part first thing said execut like you world s largest vendoragnost bug bounti program mean hacker submit see target trend micro s softwar research go look vulner trend micro s credit handl realli realli well came trend micro purchas hundr differ bug trend micro product within first year zdi disclosur particular stand one find interest receiv vulner suppos bypass lnk vulner use stuxnet vulner use stuxnet one popular vulner look everybodi initi patch came receiv bypass unbeliev – entir industri look patch nobodi notic bypass someon submit full white paper full exploit microsoft patch quick nt think much two year later vault leak guidebook cia hack tool came learn bypass stuxnet bug actual use agenc tool call ezchees vulner patch actual go develop differ tool disclosur program becom common mistak compani make tri implement ll see lot compani wo nt respond ll advertis accept vulner disclosur secur app sort thing theyr actual monitor eventu releas zeroday advisori reach press vendor reach u various differ mechan ve chief market offic compani reach u ask s go ve lowlevel engin reach u figur s go actual respons mechan fail good communic extrem import one valuabl thing build relationship research look secur vulner realli realli know technolog give lot help guidanc secur ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker']"

134,,"Companies Left Dangling As US, EU Hash Out Data Protection Differences",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31495/Companies-Left-Dangling-As-US-EU-Hash-Out-Data-Protection-Differences.html,18/08/2020,"With no common framework in place defining how to protect personal information across the Atlantic, U.S. companies may be forced to invest in new technology to silo data about European customers. The U.S. Commerce Department and the European Commissioner of Justice pledged last week to hammer out a new standard to replace the Privacy Shield, which a European court invalidated last month with no grace period for compliance. In a joint statement, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Justice Commission Didier Reynders acknowledged ""the vital importance of data protection and the significance of cross-border data transfers to our citizens and economies."" But such claims do not guarantee a new pact will stick. The now-defunct Privacy Shield, which detailed data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, took months of negotiations before it was ultimately approved in July 2016. But the framework caved in its first legal test, after Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems claimed that the privacy pact didn’t protect EU citizens from being spied on by the government. In July, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) decision in the Schrems II case left companies with very little protection beyond the standard contractual clauses (SCC) for data transfers between EU and non-EU countries. And even those were seen as inadequate and problematic. “There will be demystification needed in the coming weeks so that businesses start to realize that whilst in theory the SCCs are still there, when dealing with countries that have far reaching surveillance laws, they might not be sufficient,” said Tom de Cordier, partner at CMS. SCCs “imply that data transfer and storage processes have been proactively evaluated,"" Brittany Roush, director of The Crypsis Group, told SC Media. But that leaves too much room for interpretation. “Considering that the EU courts have already stated that SCCs are not safe from legal scrutiny, organizations would almost assuredly prefer more specific guidance.” Companies left vulnerable Without Privacy Shield for protection, “companies face a risky position that can be challenged at any time by the courts,” said Roush, noting that U.S. tech companies, in particular, could find themselves in a precarious position. “It isn’t inconceivable that the courts could test the validity of the SCCs by taking on one of the U.S. tech giants, particularly in light of both Congress's and the world’s recent focus on data privacy and the EU court's position that U.S. surveillance laws run afoul of GDPR principles,” she said. That’s one reason de Cordier believes big tech firms will be putting forward “EU-only solutions targeted at European customers to hold their data over European territory in the cloud,” which, he said, will reflect an acceleration of a trend that’s spun out over the last few years. Without “a common set of rules shared to allow businesses to operate across state and national lines,” the world will likely “become a patchwork of regulation, making it an extremely challenging place to do business,” said Danny Allan, CTO at Veeam. Coming up with a new agreement presents a challenge. Negotiators are likely to run into the same issues that sank the first Privacy Shield and the Safe Harbor act before it – U.S. surveillance laws that don’t meet the standard of protection that EU laws provide. “Without drastic reform to data privacy standards in the U.S., and the reach of agencies like the NSA, any potential new Privacy Shield agreements will most likely be swiftly shut down by the same court in the EU,” said Dan Piazza, technical product manager at Stealthbits Technologies. Here's the problem, as stated by Saryu Nayyar, CEO at Gurucul: The European Union puts data privacy for its citizens first, ahead of law enforcement and state needs. The U.S., however, puts national security and law enforcement interests ahead of personal privacy. That's a fundamental difference in perspective. Privacy Shield was viewed by the public as a means for pushing “the U.S. to get onboard with surveillance reform as well as a push for business interests to do the same,"" said Chloé Messdaghi, vice president of strategy at Point3 Security. In return, the situation provides the U.S. with two options: change surveillance standards, or leave companies with no other option but to move their operations to Europe and split systems into two parts. Forcing a compromise In real terms the EU didn’t appear to have pushed for change or even to be viewed by the public as having tried to force change. Because the U.S. has its “hands deep in tech platforms,” the EU bends to the U.S.’s will as evidenced by the tenets of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, said Messdaghi. It’s that power and control that’s driving  U.S. and EU to reach a new agreement. “But whoever controls tech has the ability to do what they want – and since that’s the U.S., it prevents the EU from imposing anything because they don't have equal standing,” said Messdaghi. “Unless both parties are equally weighted during talks, the one in control can continue to have their demands met more than the weaker party.” In the words of Nayyar, “the data must flow.” Still, despite the pledge by the EU and U.S. to craft a new agreement, Piazza remains skeptical, calling it nothing more than “hand waving at this point.” The outcome of the November presidential election will influence whether the U.S. adopts a federal data protection law that will ultimately alleviate European regulators’ concerns. At the same time, the U.K.’s fast-approaching exit from the EU is lending a sense of urgency to that country’s efforts to assure that its own surveillance laws don’t run afoul of EU requirements. “If the U.K. wants to obtain an adequacy finding from the EU by the time the current transition period ends in January 2021, it’ll have to make sure that U.K. surveillance laws have the right checks and balances built in, which isn’t the case today,” de Cordier said. In lieu of a national U.S. law and, ultimately, even with the EU-U.S. stated commitment to a solution, “companies should prepare themselves for months, if not years, of uncertainty when it comes to cross-border transfers and start proactively evaluating their risk,” said Roush. “If an organization has been reliant on Privacy Shield, then it is critical that they assess whether or not they meet an ‘adequate level of protection,’ as required by EU law.” There are some other measures that companies can adopt in the meantime, such as relying on binding corporate rules (BCRs), which are companywide data protection policies “that you make binding, then get the ok from regulatory,” said de Cordier. But even with BCRs in place, companies “might run into same problem as with Privacy Shield regarding surveillance,” he explained. “Maybe you can juggle around, surf your suppliers…stop working with them [and instead find] a European supplier that is more adequate,” he said. But that's a whole lot of maybes, with very little assurance of a reliable outcome. Said de Cordier: “There is no golden solution.""",common framework place defin protect person inform across atlant u compani may forc invest new technolog silo data european custom u commerc depart european commission justic pledg last week hammer new standard replac privaci shield european court invalid last month grace period complianc joint statement commerc secretari wilbur ross justic commiss didier reynder acknowledg vital import data protect signific crossbord data transfer citizen economi claim guarante new pact stick nowdefunct privaci shield detail data protect requir transfer person data european union switzerland unit state took month negoti ultim approv juli framework cave first legal test austrian privaci advoc max schrem claim privaci pact protect eu citizen spi govern juli european court justic ecj decis schrem ii case left compani littl protect beyond standard contractu claus scc data transfer eu noneu countri even seen inadequ problemat demystif need come week busi start realiz whilst theori sccs still deal countri far reach surveil law might suffici said tom de cordier partner cm sccs impli data transfer storag process proactiv evalu brittani roush director crypsi group told sc medium leaf much room interpret consid eu court alreadi state sccs safe legal scrutini organ would almost assur prefer specif guidanc compani left vulner without privaci shield protect compani face riski posit challeng time court said roush note u tech compani particular could find precari posit inconceiv court could test valid sccs take one u tech giant particular light congress s world recent focus data privaci eu court s posit u surveil law run afoul gdpr principl said one reason de cordier belief big tech firm put forward euon solut target european custom hold data european territori cloud said reflect acceler trend spun last year without common set rule share allow busi oper across state nation line world like becom patchwork regul make extrem challeng place busi said danni allan cto veeam come new agreement present challeng negoti like run issu sank first privaci shield safe harbor act – u surveil law meet standard protect eu law provid without drastic reform data privaci standard u reach agenc like nsa potenti new privaci shield agreement like swift shut court eu said dan piazza technic product manag stealthbit technolog s problem state saryu nayyar ceo gurucul european union put data privaci citizen first ahead law enforc state need u howev put nation secur law enforc interest ahead person privaci s fundament differ perspect privaci shield view public mean push u get onboard surveil reform well push busi interest said chloé messdaghi vice presid strategi point secur return situat provid u two option chang surveil standard leav compani option move oper europ split system two part forc compromis real term eu appear push chang even view public tri forc chang u hand deep tech platform eu bend u evidenc tenet euus privaci shield said messdaghi power control drive u eu reach new agreement whoever control tech abil want – sinc u prevent eu impos anyth nt equal stand said messdaghi unless parti equal weight talk one control continu demand met weaker parti word nayyar data must flow still despit pledg eu u craft new agreement piazza remain skeptic call noth hand wave point outcom novemb presidenti elect influenc whether u adopt feder data protect law ultim allevi european regul concern time uk fastapproach exit eu lend sens urgenc countri effort assur surveil law run afoul eu requir uk want obtain adequaci find eu time current transit period end januari make sure uk surveil law right check balanc built case today de cordier said lieu nation u law ultim even euus state commit solut compani prepar month year uncertainti come crossbord transfer start proactiv evalu risk said roush organ reliant privaci shield critic ass whether meet ‘ adequ level protect requir eu law measur compani adopt meantim reli bind corpor rule bcrs companywid data protect polici make bind get ok regulatori said de cordier even bcrs place compani might run problem privaci shield regard surveil explain mayb juggl around surf suppliers…stop work instead find european supplier adequ said s whole lot mayb littl assur reliabl outcom said de cordier golden solut ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
135,,Misconfigured Servers Contributed To More Than 200 Cloud Breaches,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31460/Misconfigured-Servers-Contributed-To-More-Than-200-Cloud-Breaches.html,"/08/5,","Misconfigured storage services in 93 percent of cloud deployments have contributed to more than 200 breaches over the past two years, exposing more than 30 billion records, according to a report from Accurics, which predicted that cloud breaches are likely to increase in both velocity and scale. The researchers found that 91 percent of the cloud deployments analyzed had at least one major exposure that left a security group wide open while in 50 percent unprotected credentials were stored in container configuration files, significant because 84 percent of organizations use containers. “While the adoption of cloud native infrastructure such as containers, serverless, and servicemesh is fueling innovation, misconfigurations are becoming commonplace and creating serious risk exposure for organizations,” said Accurics Co-founder and CTO Om Moolchandani. Private credentials with high privileges were embedded in the code in deployments at 41 percent of the organizations that responded to researchers. In 100 percent of deployments, an altered routing rule exposed a private subnet containing sensitive resources such as databases to the internet. Respondents do not liberally apply automation, even as a manual approach creates alert fatigue – only six percent of cloud-security risks are being addressed by automated technology, the report found. And, hardcoded keys are present in 72 percent of deployments. “The high percentage of cloud deployments with network exposure is concerning but not a surprise,” commented Brian Soby, CTO and co-founder of AppOmni. “In more than 95 percent of [the] risk assessments [AppOmni conducts], we find exposures of highly sensitive data (frequently including insecurely stored credentials) to the public internet or high-risk / low-privilege users such as BPOs or vendor integrations,” Soby said. “So, seeing those statistics closely align isn't surprising.” Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra, said the findings were believable. “Cloud capabilities are developed at a rapid pace and it is near impossible for anyone to keep up with all of those features and capabilities and the impact they have on data access,” Morales said. “Much of the problem is due to lack of understanding to how cloud configuration works and the potential pitfalls by an industry historically versed in securing access to physical systems.” While errors and misconfigurations exist in physical data centers, they are hidden behind a layer of controls and segregation from external factors. “In the cloud, we strip that layer away and a few keystrokes can unintentionally take a system from internal only to external facing,” Morales explained. Any massive cloud security breach signifies a larger impact footprint or blast-radius.  “I do believe such events will become more and more prevalent as the adoption of public cloud continues with individuals and companies taking a short cut approach to meet time-to-market deadlines, without executing on the shared security model of the public cloud,” said Rajiv Kanaujia, vice president of operations at CloudCheckr. Over time, IaaS vendors will make certain areas of security non-negotiable, hence restricting the success of the bad-actors, but a lack of awareness or funding to execute on the shared security model of the public cloud will continue to expose customers to such vulnerabilities, Kanaujia said. “Now, the IaaS consumer (user of the cloud) has a big role to play in configuring and managing these layers,” he said, noting that application developers never had to deal with such responsibilities in the past.Kanaujia agreed that a better approach is moving towards Infrastructure as Code (IAC), where such configuration changes become transparent to internal teams and go through a better change management process, including peer review. The industry will encourage concepts like encrypted data-bags that will slowly eliminate the need for having credentials in clear text anywhere in the system, he added.",misconfigur storag servic percent cloud deploy contribut breach past two year expos billion record accord report accur predict cloud breach like increas veloc scale research found percent cloud deploy analyz least one major exposur left secur group wide open percent unprotect credenti store contain configur file signific percent organ use contain adopt cloud nativ infrastructur contain serverless servicemesh fuel innov misconfigur becom commonplac creat serious risk exposur organ said accur cofound cto om moolchandani privat credenti high privileg embed code deploy percent organ respond research percent deploy alter rout rule expos privat subnet contain sensit resourc databas internet respond liber appli autom even manual approach creat alert fatigu – six percent cloudsecur risk address autom technolog report found hardcod key present percent deploy high percentag cloud deploy network exposur concern surpris comment brian sobi cto cofound appomni percent risk assess appomni conduct find exposur high sensit data frequent includ insecur store credenti public internet highrisk lowprivileg user bpos vendor integr sobi said see statist close align nt surpris chris moral head secur analyt vectra said find believ cloud capabl develop rapid pace near imposs anyon keep featur capabl impact data access moral said much problem due lack understand cloud configur work potenti pitfal industri histor vers secur access physic system error misconfigur exist physic data center hidden behind layer control segreg extern factor cloud strip layer away keystrok unintent take system intern extern face moral explain massiv cloud secur breach signifi larger impact footprint blastradius believ event becom preval adopt public cloud continu individu compani take short cut approach meet timetomarket deadlin without execut share secur model public cloud said rajiv kanaujia vice presid oper cloudcheckr time iaa vendor make certain area secur nonnegoti henc restrict success badactor lack awar fund execut share secur model public cloud continu expos custom vulner kanaujia said iaa consum user cloud big role play configur manag layer said note applic develop never deal respons pastkanaujia agre better approach move toward infrastructur code iac configur chang becom transpar intern team go better chang manag process includ peer review industri encourag concept like encrypt databag slowli elimin need credenti clear text anywher system ad ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'amazon', 'data loss', 'flaw']"
136,,OKCupid Fixed Serious Security Vulnerability After Alert,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31440/OKCupid-Fixed-Serious-Security-Vulnerability-After-Alert.html,29/07/2020,"The popular online OKCupid dating service left the private details of its more than 50 million users in 110 countries vulnerable to hacking, reports Check Point this morning in a report. After discovering the potential for malicious actions, Check Point presented its findings to OKCupid, which fixed the security flaws in its servers within 48 hours of being notified. The dating service said not a single user was impacted by the potential vulnerability, which could have allowed a threat actor to masquerade as a user. At risk were full profile details, private messages, sexual orientation, personal addresses, and all submitted answers to OKCupid’s profiling questions. Malicious actions, such as manipulating user profile data and sending messages, on behalf of a victim, without that user’s knowledge, could have taken place, according to a Check Point report. To carry out the attack, a threat actor could have executed malicious code into OkCupid web and mobile pages by generating a single, malicious link to send users. Check Point researchers outlined the attack method in three steps: Check Point reverse engineered the OkCupid Android Mobile application (v40.3.1 on Android 6.0.1) and discovered that the application opened a WebView (and enables JavaScript to execute in the context of the WebView window) and loaded remote URLs. While reverse engineering the OkCupid application, Check Point found a “deep links” functionality, making it possible to invoke intents in the app via a browser link.  As a result, an attacker could masquerade as an OkCupid user and carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user’s data. A similar attack five years ago on the Ashley Madison dating service for married people resurfaced this past January when app users were hit with ransomware demands in which their affairs would be revealed to spouses and others they know if the didn’t pay. Oded Vanunu, Check Point’s head of products vulnerability research, said the OKCupid investigation raises serious questions about the security of all dating apps. “The fundamental questions being: How safe are my intimate details on the application? How easily can someone I don’t know access my most private photos, messages and details?” Vanunu asked rhetorically. Check Point said its work into OKCupid has sparked further investigation into other dating applications. Dating service popularity has risen since the pandemic hit in mid-March when the lockdown spurred social distancing. OkCupid, in fact, has seen a 30 percent increase in messages, 20 percent increase in conversations and a 10 percent increase in matches worldwide.    OkCupid stated once the security problem was fixed, a solution was responsibly deployed to ensure its users can safely continue using the OkCupid app.",popular onlin okcupid date servic left privat detail million user countri vulner hack report check point morn report discov potenti malici action check point present find okcupid fix secur flaw server within hour notifi date servic said singl user impact potenti vulner could allow threat actor masquerad user risk full profil detail privat messag sexual orient person address submit answer okcupid profil question malici action manipul user profil data send messag behalf victim without user knowledg could taken place accord check point report carri attack threat actor could execut malici code okcupid web mobil page generat singl malici link send user check point research outlin attack method three step check point revers engin okcupid android mobil applic v android discov applic open webview enabl javascript execut context webview window load remot url revers engin okcupid applic check point found deep link function make possibl invok intent app via browser link result attack could masquerad okcupid user carri action user abl perform access user data similar attack five year ago ashley madison date servic marri peopl resurfac past januari app user hit ransomwar demand affair would reveal spous other know pay ode vanunu check point head product vulner research said okcupid investig rais serious question secur date app fundament question safe intim detail applic easili someon know access privat photo messag detail vanunu ask rhetor check point said work okcupid spark investig date applic date servic popular risen sinc pandem hit midmarch lockdown spur social distanc okcupid fact seen percent increas messag percent increas convers percent increas match worldwid okcupid state secur problem fix solut respons deploy ensur user safe continu use okcupid app ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
137,,Dave ShinyHunters Hack Exposes 7.5 Million User Records,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31434/Dave-ShinyHunters-Hack-Exposes-7.5-Million-User-Records.html,28/07/2020,"Overdraft protection and cash advance service Dave suffered a data breach that appeared to involve the practices of a former third-party vendor, resulting in its database containing 7.5 million user records being sold at auction and then released later for free on hacker forums. The stolen information, which appeared to be taken by hacking group ShinyHunters, included personal user information including names, emails, birth dates, physical addresses and phone numbers, but not bank account numbers, credit card numbers, records of financial transactions, or unencrypted Social Security numbers, according to a company blog post. Third-party vendor Waydev, a former business partner that used to work with Dave, apparently used compromised OAuth tokens. Dave said it has no evidence that any unauthorized actions were taken with any accounts or that any user has experienced any financial loss as a result of the incident, which it’s in the process of Dave is in the process of notifying all customers to reset of all their customer passwords for the company. The company reported the incident to the FBI and retained CrowdStrike to assist with the mitigation. The malicious party recently gained unauthorized access to such Dave-user data, including user passwords that were stored in hashed form using bcrypt. However, Dave’s assertion that the breach occurred through a third party does not absolve it of responsibility, pointed out Javvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4. “The fact remains that whenever an organization outsources any part of its operation to a third party, be it physically or in the cloud, they are still responsible for the security of the data and need to put in place comprehensive security controls with the third party as well as gain assurance those controls are working correctly,” Malik said. Mark Bower, senior vice president at data security specialist comforte AG, said the current system for vetting the operations is inadequate. “The dirty industry secret here is that while enterprises might feel they have secured third party vendors through a set of laborious 1,200 vendor assessment questions or a past SOC2 or ISO 27001 assessment of security controls, the fact is those do not go far enough,” Bower said. While compliance to such frameworks is important to establish security culture, executive accountability, and baseline controls, it’s worthless if the attackers can bypass them and get to data. “That can happen from human error, social engineering, malware, API and vulnerably exploitation,” Bower added. Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture for Cerberus Sentinel, said the data breach of Dave’s customer information highlights the dangers of improper IT security vendor management.  “Failing to quantify the risk of granting third parties access to sensitive data leads to lax controls and monitoring by many organizations,” Clements said.  As part of an effective vendor management program, all business partners that interact with sensitive systems or data should be contractually bound to regularly demonstrate that they are following information security best practices and have regular security testing or “ethical hacking” performed against their environment.  “The root cause of the breach at Waydev was a blind SQL injection attack that should have been caught by regular penetration tests and would have prevented this particular breach if remediated,” Clements said. To manage risk across their networks as well as a growing array of partners, the enterprise needs to tools that can monitor and prioritize vulnerabilities across the entire threat ecosystem, particularly areas with low visibility like user management, pointed out Vinay Sridhara, CTO at Balbix.",overdraft protect cash advanc servic dave suffer data breach appear involv practic former thirdparti vendor result databas contain million user record sold auction releas later free hacker forum stolen inform appear taken hack group shinyhunt includ person user inform includ name email birth date physic address phone number bank account number credit card number record financi transact unencrypt social secur number accord compani blog post thirdparti vendor waydev former busi partner use work dave appar use compromis oauth token dave said evid unauthor action taken account user experienc financi loss result incid process dave process notifi custom reset custom password compani compani report incid fbi retain crowdstrik assist mitig malici parti recent gain unauthor access daveus data includ user password store hash form use bcrypt howev dave assert breach occur third parti absolv respons point javvad malik secur awar advoc knowb fact remain whenev organ outsourc part oper third parti physic cloud still respons secur data need put place comprehens secur control third parti well gain assur control work correct malik said mark bower senior vice presid data secur specialist comfort ag said current system vet oper inadequ dirti industri secret enterpris might feel secur third parti vendor set labori vendor assess question past soc iso assess secur control fact go far enough bower said complianc framework import establish secur cultur execut account baselin control worthless attack bypass get data happen human error social engin malwar api vulner exploit bower ad chris clement vice presid solut architectur cerberus sentinel said data breach dave custom inform highlight danger improp secur vendor manag fail quantifi risk grant third parti access sensit data lead lax control monitor mani organ clement said part effect vendor manag program busi partner interact sensit system data contractu bound regular demonstr follow inform secur best practic regular secur test ethic hack perform environ root caus breach waydev blind sql inject attack caught regular penetr test would prevent particular breach remedi clement said manag risk across network well grow array partner enterpris need tool monitor priorit vulner across entir threat ecosystem particular area low visibl like user manag point vinay sridhara cto balbix ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'bank', 'data loss']"
138,,"New Cryptominer Botnet Spreads Payload, Less Intrusive",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31423/New-Cryptominer-Botnet-Spreads-Payload-Less-Intrusive.html,23/07/2020,"A new cryptocurrency-mining botnet attack called Prometei bypasses detection systems and monetizes its campaigns in less intrusive ways. It is the first time that anyone’s documented a multi-modular botnet, according to Talos, which discovered the botnet and dubbed it “Prometei.” The botnet, which has been active since March, spreads a payload to provide financial benefits for the attackers by mining Monero for a single developer – also the actor – most likely in Eastern Europe. Talos in a new report said defenders are likely to spot the botnet, but the infection likely won’t be obvious to end-users. The discovery resulted from Talos investigating telemetry information it received from Cisco AMP for Endpoints’ install base. After studying its activities over the past two months, Talos believes the actor has used different methods to spread Prometei through a network to gain credentials and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and Server Message Block (SMB) exploits. The adversary also uses several crafted tools that help the botnet increase the amount of systems participating in its Monero-mining pool. The infection starts with the main botnet file, which is copied from other infected systems by means of SMB, using passwords retrieved by a modified Mimikatz module and exploits such as Eternal Blue. Talos said the botnet appears to be aware of the latest SMB vulnerabilities, such as SMBGhost, but it did not find evidence of that exploit being utilized. Prometei has more than 15 executable modules that all get downloaded and driven by the main module, which constantly communicates with the command and control (C2) server over HTTP. The botnet uses techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK framework, most notably T1089 (Disabling Security Tools), T1105 (Remote File Copy), T1027 (Obfuscated Files or Information), T1086 (PowerShell), T1035 (Service Execution), T1036 (Masquerading) and T1090 (Connection Proxy).",new cryptocurrencymin botnet attack call prometei bypass detect system monet campaign le intrus way first time anyon document multimodular botnet accord talo discov botnet dub prometei botnet activ sinc march spread payload provid financi benefit attack mine monero singl develop – also actor – like eastern europ talo new report said defend like spot botnet infect like obvious endus discoveri result talo investig telemetri inform receiv cisco amp endpoint instal base studi activ past two month talo belief actor use differ method spread prometei network gain credenti window manag instrument wmi server messag block smb exploit adversari also us sever craft tool help botnet increas amount system particip moneromin pool infect start main botnet file copi infect system mean smb use password retriev modifi mimikatz modul exploit etern blue talo said botnet appear awar latest smb vulner smbghost find evid exploit util prometei execut modul get download driven main modul constant communic command control c server http botnet us techniqu mitr att ck framework notabl t disabl secur tool t remot file copi t obfusc file inform t powershel t servic execut t masquerad t connect proxi ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'botnet', 'fraud', 'cryptography']"
139,,Justice Charges Chinese Nationals In Hacking Campaign,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31419/Justice-Charges-Chinese-Nationals-In-Hacking-Campaign.html,22/07/2020,"Two Chinese hackers working with the Ministry of State Security, and charged by the Justice Department on Tuesday, allegedly ran a more-than-decade-long campaign hacking into the systems of hundreds of companies, governments, NGOs, dissidents, human rights activists and even clergy, nicking intellectual property and proprietary business research and more recently targeting companies developing COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatments. The duo, who the DOJ says operated sometimes for their own gain and other times on behalf of the MSS or other Chinese government entities, were indicted on 11 counts by a federal grand jury in Spokane, Wash. According to the Justice Department, Li Xiaoyu, 34, and Dong Jiazhi, 33, targeted high-tech manufacturing; medical devices, civil and industrial engineering; business, educational, and gaming software; solar energy; pharmaceuticals; and the defense industry in countries including the U.S., Australia, Belgium, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden and the U.K. They took advantage of the pandemic, much like Russian operatives did, by plying the systems of companies developing COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, the DOJ states. “Today’s indictment demonstrates the serious consequences the Chinese MSS and its proxies will face if they continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics to either steal what they cannot create or silence what they do not want to hear,” FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said in a release. “Cybercrimes directed by the Chinese government’s intelligence services not only threaten the United States but also every other country that supports fair play, international norms, and the rule of law, and it also seriously undermines China's to become a respected leader in world affairs.” The hacking scheme was first uncovered on computers belonging to the Department of Energy's Hanford Site, according to William Hyslop, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington, noting that the two men operated out of China. “As the grand jury charged, the computer systems of many businesses, individuals and agencies throughout the United States and worldwide have been hacked and compromised with a huge array of sensitive and valuable trade secrets, technologies, data and personal information being stolen,” he said.  Noting that ""the size and scope of this indictment, and the wealth of data taken is staggering"" and ""much of the focus is on medical and biotech research for obvious reasons,"" Tim Bandos, vice president of cybersecurity at Digital Guardian, said ""the 10-plus year compendium of attacks belies much bigger and more systemic issues. Whether for vaccines, or economic competitiveness, nation states are continuously looking to plunder our most valuable IP and assets – and not only from creators, but their manufacturing and development supply chains.” Bandos pointed out that the hackers used some methods that exploited know vulnerabilities in popular software and leveraged credential theft and other commonly used attack techniques. “To that end, it goes without saying that while Zero Days and APTs exist, we first need to address foundational data protection and governance controls which can prevent or at least limit what goes out from a compromised device,” he said.",two chines hacker work ministri state secur charg justic depart tuesday alleg ran morethandecadelong campaign hack system hundr compani govern ngo dissid human right activist even clergi nick intellectu properti proprietari busi research recent target compani develop covid vaccin test treatment duo doj say oper sometim gain time behalf ms chines govern entiti indict count feder grand juri spokan wash accord justic depart li xiaoyu dong jiazhi target hightech manufactur medic devic civil industri engin busi educ game softwar solar energi pharmaceut defens industri countri includ u australia belgium germani japan lithuania netherland spain south korea sweden uk took advantag pandem much like russian oper pli system compani develop covid vaccin treatment doj state today indict demonstr serious consequ chines ms proxi face continu deploy malici cyber tactic either steal creat silenc want hear fbi deputi director david bowdich said releas cybercrim direct chines govern intellig servic threaten unit state also everi countri support fair play intern norm rule law also serious undermin china s becom respect leader world affair hack scheme first uncov comput belong depart energi s hanford site accord william hyslop u attorney eastern district washington note two men oper china grand juri charg comput system mani busi individu agenc throughout unit state worldwid hack compromis huge array sensit valuabl trade secret technolog data person inform stolen said note size scope indict wealth data taken stagger much focus medic biotech research obvious reason tim bando vice presid cybersecur digit guardian said plus year compendium attack beli much bigger system issu whether vaccin econom competit nation state continu look plunder valuabl ip asset – creator manufactur develop suppli chain bando point hacker use method exploit know vulner popular softwar leverag credenti theft common use attack techniqu end go without say zero day apt exist first need address foundat data protect govern control prevent least limit go compromis devic said ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'usa', 'china', 'data loss', 'cyberwar', 'spyware']"
140,,"EU Court Kills Privacy Shield, Wreaks Havoc On Digital Economy",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31407/EU-Court-Kills-Privacy-Shield-Wreaks-Havoc-On-Digital-Economy.html,17/07/2020,"The EU court decision in the Schrems II case that effectively kills the Privacy Shield pact hammered out four years ago between the U.S. and EU could cripple multinational companies' ability to operate as they scramble to scrutinize their data transfer mechanisms. “This is a stunning and completely unexpected decision. In invalidating the Privacy Shield framework, the European Court of Justice has jeopardized the ability of thousands of companies to do business in the EU,” said Lisa Sotto, head of the global privacy and cybersecurity practice at Hunton Andrews Kurth. “This decision not only topples a well-ensconced data transfer regime that is relied on by over 5,000 U.S. companies, but it also calls into question the ability of multinational companies to transfer data to the U.S. under any mechanism.”  But Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum (ISF), said Schrems II “was always going to be a major test for the Privacy Shield,” so for many, the decision “has come as no surprise that the European Court of Justice has responded in this way,” considering the jumble of state privacy laws currently governing personal data in the U.S. The ECJ essentially agreed with Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems, who claimed that the privacy pact didn’t protect EU citizens from being spied on by the government, pointing to U.S. national security laws allowing surveillance of foreign nationals. The then 28 members of the EU gave their approval to a rejiggered EU-US Privacy Shield Agreement in July 2016, but privacy advocates stressed the pact would likely be challenged in court, much like its predecessor, the Safe Harbor agreement, which the ECJ earlier struck down in response to a previous Schrems case brought in the wake of former CIA subcontractor Edward Snowden’s revelations that the NSA was running a covert program that spied and collected data on U.S. citizens. In today’s decision, the court said U.S. surveillance laws “are not limited to what is strictly necessary.” ""This judgment is the second major blow delivered to the U.S. privacy and data protection legal framework by the EU Court of Justice relating to the Snowden disclosures, and in today's climate of unstable transatlantic political relationships, it is unlikely to meet with approval in the U.S.,” said Stewart Room, global head of data protection and cybersecurity at DWF. With the death knell sounded on Privacy Shield, the 5,300 or so companies previously under its protection must rely on standard contractual clauses (SCCs) that Europe uses for companies in other countries and even some U.S. organizations like Microsoft. ""Fortunately, there are workarounds to maintain data flows to the U.S., which include the standard contractual clauses. The SCCs and other workarounds can keep data flowing to the U.S., said Room. Those workarounds also mean “adjustments can be made where necessary, to keep data flows to the U.S. alive.” But businesses that use SCCs still will find themselves “under the gun,” said Sotto. “While the [court’s] decision kept SCCs in place as a transfer tool, there are new and immediate obligations that companies relying on SCCs for their data transfers will need to reconsider, particularly with respect to transfers to the U.S. Having SCCs in place is not a get-out-of-jail-free card.” The court’s action also has created a good bit of uncertainty for the companies once covered by Privacy Shield, and privacy advocates questioned the timing of the ruling. “The impact on business?  Not great,” said Durbin. “At a time when many businesses are doing all they can to remain open and trading post-pandemic as we head into one of the worst global recessions for some time, this additional compliance burden is something many could have well done without.” Eline Chivot, senior policy analyst at ITIF's Center for Data Innovation, slammed the decision as “nothing short of irresponsible” coming during the pandemic when “global data flows are more vital than ever.” Bridget Treacy, data privacy partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth, called on EU regulators “to adopt a pragmatic approach to enforcement, allowing businesses a period of grace in which to implement alternative arrangements to the Shield in order to continue to lawfully transfer personal data from the EU to the U.S.” and to provide “urgent guidance from regulators on transition arrangements.” For the time being, companies must protect themselves. Sotto said that organizations “that relied on the Privacy Shield will immediately need to shift gears and put another data transfer mechanism in place.” In the short term, companies, in addition to consulting their legal counsels, must “make sure they have a clear understanding of whose data they have, what is their residency, where it is stored, where that data center is located and maps of where data is flowing,” said BigID Vice President of Privacy & Policy Heather Federman. “If a multinational corporation can ensure they are accurately tracking personal data, it will significantly minimize the risk” of negative impact from this decision. Europe’s strict privacy regulations can help protect companies while the EU and U.S. sort out future requirements. “Good practice will require strict adherence to the GDPR rules since without the Privacy Shield companies must adhere to the guidelines set out around its extraterritorial application,” said Durbin. The court’s decision should be a rallying call for the U.S. to finally cobble together a national privacy law. “The patchwork of privacy laws that make up the various rules governing personal data in the United States ranging from the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) through to failed attempts in other states such as the Washington State Privacy Act and New York Privacy Act (NYPA) which both failed to pass their legislative sessions last year... point to the long overdue need for a federal law on privacy that at least meets the same level of protection as the GDPR,” said Durbin, who doubts such national legislation will be forthcoming. “Federal lawmakers have traditionally shied away from such a move preferring to hand responsibility for enforcement to state attorneys-general.” Although the ruling applies to transfers between the U.S. and EU, its implications spread well beyond the U.S. “Twice now the European Commission has tried to reach an agreement with the U.S. on data protection, only to have its efforts ruled unlawful,” said Room. “There needs to be a different mindset to how the challenges of international transfers to the U.S. are met, because failed schemes like this have significant impacts for individuals and for businesses.” In regard to SCCs, the court likely puts “EU trade at risk with other third countries such as China and Russia, which also don’t have a judge examining each part of national security surveillance,” said Peter Swire, Alston & Bird privacy and data security practice senior counsel and a former privacy negotiator with the EU, who pointed to China’s paucity of limitations on surveillance. “If the E.U. doesn’t assess third country law, national data protection authorities are in a weak position to make decisions about which third countries lack essential equivalence to the E.U.  legal standards,” said Swire, who testified as an expert witness during the trial phase of the case and also testified at the invitation of European data protection officials after the 2015 Schrems decision. “The DPAs typically have no access to national security expertise at the top-secret level and lack the resources to assess third country legal systems in a fair and comprehensive way.” Pressing for the E.U. to offer “some Europe-wide mechanism to have an informed process about third country surveillance regimes,” Swire said, “If you take a step back, it is extraordinary to think that the individual in one country has a right to have a judge in a different country examine all of the surveillance relevant to that individual. That is contrary to how intelligence actions have worked since the dawn of time.”",eu court decis schrem ii case effect kill privaci shield pact hammer four year ago u eu could crippl multin compani

The data stolen from an attack on the Volusion e-commerce platform in 2019, for example, was valued at $133 million on the dark web,” said Ameet Naik, security evangelist at PerimeterX. Hidden Cobra developed a global exfiltration network using legitimate sites that had been attacked and repurposed like those of an Italian modeling agency, a vintage music store in Tehran and a family-run bookstore in New Jersey, Sansec said. ""Given the economic situation in North Korea, it would be no surprise to see their cyberwarfare units spreading more broadly into the world of cybercrime,” said Saryu Nayyar, CEO at Gurucul. “These Magecart attacks have been observed since 2015, which indicates we still have a way to go towards securing our e-commerce applications.”  Noting that the “series of attacks used a combination of lookalike domains and legitimate websites, all controlled by the attackers, as a means of exfiltrating the stolen data,” Naik said, “The use of such techniques makes it difficult to prevent Magecart attacks using pre-configured policies alone.”",hidden cobra threat actor behind seri attack aim u european shopper use magecart skim credit card inform retail research attribut activ hidden cobra infrastructur previous oper reus accord report sansec also identifi distinct pattern malwar code link multipl hack actor hacker known primarili attack bank south korean crypto market recent train focus skim incid retail clair focus camera paper sourc shown digit skim attack lucrat sourc revenu hacker data stolen attack volus ecommerc platform exampl valu million dark web said ameet naik secur evangelist perimeterx hidden cobra develop global exfiltr network use legitim site attack repurpos like italian model agenc vintag music store tehran familyrun bookstor new jersey sansec said given econom situat north korea would surpris see cyberwarfar unit spread broad world cybercrim said saryu nayyar ceo gurucul magecart attack observ sinc indic still way go toward secur ecommerc applic note seri attack use combin lookalik domain legitim websit control attack mean exfiltr stolen data naik said use techniqu make difficult prevent magecart attack use preconfigur polici alon ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'cybercrime', 'fraud', 'korea']"
142,,MongoDB Hacker Threatens To Report Breach To GDPR,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31358/MongoDB-Hacker-Threatens-To-Report-Breach-To-GDPR.html,"/07/3,","A hacker that uploaded ransom notes on nearly 23,000 MongoDB databases left exposed online without passwords has given his potential victims until tomorrow to pay a $140 ransom, or possibly report the breach to local GDPR authorities. According to recent ZDNet story, the hacker used an automated script to scan for misconfigured MongoDB databases, effectively wiping the content. The hacker then left a ransom note asking for the payment. The miscreant threatened to report the breach to the local GDPR authorities within two days if they refused to pay up in two days - on July 3. James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said it's bad enough the victims lost data. Now, an organization has to pay to get the decryption key from the cyber criminals and possibly would need to pay again not to have it leaked to the public. “Adding to this challenging incident is the threat of the data and information going to the authorities,” McQuiggan said. “Organizations familiar with the GDPR realize the fines can be a substantial sum of money and could be detrimental to their profits and possibly loss of reputation with their shareholders. If someone else informs the supervisory authorities, it could cost the organization a significant amount of money versus them just reporting it themselves.” Brandon Hoffman, CISO at Netenrich, said while there may be some altruistic component of this attack, based on previous activity from similar attacks (not against MongoDB), Hoffman views the GDPR tactic as an extension of the threat. “The rise in extortion tactics to get the ransom paid, in my mind, makes it clear that it’s simply another technique in the same playbook,” Hoffman said. “Were this truly a hacktivism related threat, there would be some other clear motivation tied to a political or social movement and almost certainly there wouldn’t be such an easy out -- $140 -- from the backlash these companies would receive from GDPR.”  Andrew Barratt, head of investigations at Coalfire, said this wasn’t altruism, it was naivety. “The intruder was incredibly naïve to think they can extort a company with a regulatory disclosure from their criminal attack,” Barratt said. “Imagine a car thief stealing your car, then threaten they’ll call your insurance company to tell them  ‘hey – the locks were not on the insurer approved list.’”   Barratt said it’s clearly a commercial hack. With such a small dollar value, he said the hacker hopes people will just simply pay the ransom. “Disclosure to the appropriate supervisory authorities is also an incredibly high- risk maneuver for the criminal with the possibility of being discovered,” Barratt said. “Assuming 23,000 don’t pay out – reporting to the authorities would require a significant amount of effort. It would require the intruder to confirm which data protection authority in Europe is the one the business identified as their reporting body. It’s a fairly big lift to do that correctly when you’re doing it for your own purposes – but imagine doing it for all 23,000 entities.”  Barratt said here’s a snapshot of what the hacker would have to turn over to all the various authorities, assuming he could figure that out: A description of the nature of the personal data breach including, where possible: “I’d say it’s not just a hollow threat, but mostly an inert one,” Barratt said. “Their biggest actual threat is making the data inaccessible for a while and hoping the hacked entity doesn’t have a good backup.”",hacker upload ransom note near mongodb databas left expos onlin without password given potenti victim tomorrow pay ransom possibl report breach local gdpr author accord recent zdnet stori hacker use autom script scan misconfigur mongodb databas effect wipe content hacker left ransom note ask payment miscreant threaten report breach local gdpr author within two day refus pay two day juli jame mcquiggan secur awar advoc knowb said s bad enough victim lost data organ pay get decrypt key cyber crimin possibl would need pay leak public ad challeng incid threat data inform go author mcquiggan said organ familiar gdpr realiz fine substanti sum money could detriment profit possibl loss reput sharehold someon els inform supervisori author could cost organ signific amount money versus report themselv brandon hoffman ciso netenrich said may altruist compon attack base previous activ similar attack mongodb hoffman view gdpr tactic extens threat rise extort tactic get ransom paid mind make clear simpli anoth techniqu playbook hoffman said truli hacktiv relat threat would clear motiv tie polit social movement almost certain easi backlash compani would receiv gdpr andrew barratt head investig coalfir said altruism naiveti intrud incred naïv think extort compani regulatori disclosur crimin attack barratt said imagin car thief steal car threaten call insur compani tell ‘ hey – lock insur approv list barratt said clear commerci hack small dollar valu said hacker hope peopl simpli pay ransom disclosur appropri supervisori author also incred high risk maneuv crimin possibl discov barratt said assum pay – report author would requir signific amount effort would requir intrud confirm data protect author europ one busi identifi report bodi fair big lift correct purpos – imagin entiti barratt said snapshot hacker would turn various author assum could figur descript natur person data breach includ possibl say hollow threat most inert one barratt said biggest actual threat make data inaccess hope hack entiti good backup ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'government', 'privacy', 'database', 'data loss']"

144,,Glupteba Malware Leverages Blockchain As A Comms Channel,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31339/Glupteba-Malware-Leverages-Blockchain-As-A-Comms-Channel.html,26/06/2020,"Glupteba malware does something novel: It uses the bitcoin blockchain as a communications channel to receive updated configuration information. That’s important because malware always needs a way to go back to its home base, preferably without being detected, according to a paper released this week by Sophos Labs researchers. The new form of malware sprinkles some of the old with the new to launch malware that can steal local PII on web browsers and then launch similar attacks from the victim’s home network. But even as it blazes a new trail for maneuvering malware in the blockchain world, Glupteba uses one of the oldest tricks in the book: The malware preys on people’s unending desire to get something for nothing. Andrew Brandt, a principal researcher at Sophos Labs, explained that Glupteba tends to prey on people who frequent piracy sites looking for popular graphics programs such as Adobe Illustrator. “This is definitely a play for people working from home or people who have their kids at home,” Brandt says. “I don’t know what it is, people must know these sites are bad, but the lure is too strong. Glupteba tends to prey on people who don’t have a lot of money, but need the functionality of these software programs.” Brandt would not disclose the damage Glupteba has caused and would not tie these activities to specific threat groups. However, while Sophos researchers don’t have any direct information about why the creators of Glupteba have made this malware, Brandt said a potential motive may be to create a network of machines in which they can sell access – mainly to other malware groups. “We also know they have a component of their malware that steals passwords and other sensitive data from the infected machine, but we have no information about what they do with that information, and we’d prefer not to speculate whether they use it themselves, sell it onward, or do something else with it,” Brandt added. According to a recent Sophos blog, while many of Glupteba’s self-protection components mean that it has many tricks available to stop itself showing up in the victim’s security logs, this complexity makes the malware less reliable, and ironically more prone to triggering security alarms at some point. “Some of the low-level programming tricks it uses…not only don’t work on recent versions of Windows, but also often draw attention to themselves by the way they misbehave, up to and including crashing your computer with a giveaway blue screen of death,” the blog reported. Despite these reassuring points, once Glupteba infects a machine, it has any number of ways to make its way on to networks and has been cleverly designed to evade defenders. Here are the main characteristics of Glupteba as outlined by Sophos Labs:   Charles Ragland, security engineer at  Digital Shadows, views Glupteba as an advanced piece of malware that’s capable of many common bot actions. “The concept of bots being able to communicate back to a C2 (command and control) server to receive instructions is nothing new, however, the use of messages relayed via blockchain transactions is intriguing and novel,” Ragland says. “This is a clear demonstration of attackers modifying existing techniques to adapt new technologies to their arsenal and continue their activities in an obfuscated manner.” And Hank Schless, senior manager, security solutions at Lookout, explained that given the increasing similarities in functionality between mobile devices and laptops, particularly the reliance on cloud services, this type of malware could just as easily get used to target mobile devices.  “The components of this attack, such as the rootkit, virus, and browser stealer all have mobile equivalencies in the form of rooting or jailbreaking, hidden mobile malware, and screen overlay attacks,” Schless said. “Since anything that transacts cryptocurrency uses blockchain, this communication method could be altered to function on mobile malware, allowing a mobile app to covertly receive command and control instructions.”",glupteba malwar someth novel us bitcoin blockchain communic channel receiv updat configur inform import malwar alway need way go back home base prefer without detect accord paper releas week sopho lab research new form malwar sprinkl old new launch malwar steal local pii web browser launch similar attack victim home network even blaze new trail maneuv malwar blockchain world glupteba us one oldest trick book malwar prey peopl unend desir get someth noth andrew brandt princip research sopho lab explain glupteba tend prey peopl frequent piraci site look popular graphic program adob illustr definit play peopl work home peopl kid home brandt say know peopl must know site bad lure strong glupteba tend prey peopl lot money need function softwar program brandt would disclos damag glupteba caus would tie activ specif threat group howev sopho research direct inform creator glupteba made malwar brandt said potenti motiv may creat network machin sell access – main malwar group also know compon malwar steal password sensit data infect machin inform inform prefer specul whether use sell onward someth els brandt ad accord recent sopho blog mani glupteba selfprotect compon mean mani trick avail stop show victim secur log complex make malwar le reliabl iron prone trigger secur alarm point lowlevel program trick uses…not work recent version window also often draw attent way misbehav includ crash comput giveaway blue screen death blog report despit reassur point glupteba infect machin number way make way network clever design evad defend main characterist glupteba outlin sopho lab charl ragland secur engin digit shadow view glupteba advanc piec malwar capabl mani common bot action concept bot abl communic back c command control server receiv instruct noth new howev use messag relay via blockchain transact intrigu novel ragland say clear demonstr attack modifi exist techniqu adapt new technolog arsenal continu activ obfusc manner hank schless senior manag secur solut lookout explain given increas similar function mobil devic laptop particular relianc cloud servic type malwar could easili get use target mobil devic compon attack rootkit virus browser stealer mobil equival form root jailbreak hidden mobil malwar screen overlay attack schless said sinc anyth transact cryptocurr us blockchain communic method could alter function mobil malwar allow mobil app covert receiv command control instruct ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'malware', 'cryptography']"

Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters. “Number two, there are still so many questions that need to be answered about real abuses that happened in the FISA system.”  In mid-May the Senate passed an amendment to the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act that would put a check on government surveillance activities by expanding the role of independent “friend of the court” to include FBI surveillance asks in all cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. By voting in the amendment, the Senate sent the bill back to the House, delaying reauthorization of the act. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has had trouble getting support for the bill and President Trump has said he would veto it. “It’s utter hypocrisy that the president has threatened to veto the bill for not being strong enough, while his own Justice Department urges opposition to reforms that directly address the Carter Page surveillance abuses,” said ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel Neema Singh Guliani. “It is also disappointing that Congress can’t come together to pass privacy reforms that Republicans and Democrats agree on — and advocated for long before Trump became president.” If the president was “truly concerned, he should tell his attorney general and many leaders of his own party to stop being roadblocks to reform” and should put his support  behind “bipartisan amendments that have been introduced to improve the FISA bill to better protect privacy,” Guliani said. “Similarly, if leaders in the House are truly committed to safeguarding the Constitution, they should allow a vote on bipartisan amendments to improve the legislation.""",hous late wednesday nix plan vote fisa bill pass earlier month senat would author three surveil initi usa freedom act formal announc whip number one s go becom law rep steve scalis rla told report number two still mani question need answer real abus happen fisa system midmay senat pass amend usa freedom reauthor act would put check govern surveil activ expand role independ friend court includ fbi surveil ask case foreign intellig surveil court vote amend senat sent bill back hous delay reauthor act hous speaker nanci pelosi dcalif troubl get support bill presid trump said would veto utter hypocrisi presid threaten veto bill strong enough justic depart urg opposit reform direct address carter page surveil abus said aclu senior legisl counsel neema singh guliani also disappoint congress come togeth pas privaci reform republican democrat agre — advoc long trump becam presid presid truli concern tell attorney general mani leader parti stop roadblock reform put support behind bipartisan amend introduc improv fisa bill better protect privaci guliani said similar leader hous truli commit safeguard constitut allow vote bipartisan amend improv legisl ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'spyware']"
148,,REvil Attackers Change Focus To Attacking A Food Distributor,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31217/REvil-Attackers-Change-Focus-To-Attacking-A-Food-Distributor.html,18/05/2020,"The REvil/Sodinokibi ransomware hackers that struck celebrity law firm Grubman, Shire, Meiselas and Sacks and threatened to release information on clients like Lady Gaga and Madonna as well as President Trump likely exploited an unpatched Citrix vulnerability, and have now turned their sights to a major food company, Sherwood Forest and Harvest Distributors. “...Sherwood has been aware of and dealing with this attack for over a week, although it had not gone public, according to researchers at DarkOwl, who said the attackers posted a notice online Friday threatening to download eight of the company’s proprietary files as a preview of releases to come. The first link contains around 2,300 files. “These files contain highly sensitive data including cash-flow analysis, sub-distributor info, detailed insurance information, proprietary vendor information – including that of Kroger, Albertsons, Sprouts – scanned drivers license images for drivers in their distribution networks, etc.,” the researchers said in a blog post. The REvil attackers have recently upped their activity, striking a variety of targets from travel companies to dentist offices. Last week, they published some files on Lady Gaga and Christina Aguilera and doubled the ransom request for Grubman’s files to $42 million and threatened to release damaging information on President Trump. Despite the escalating threats, Grubman has said it would not pay the ransom, noting in a statement that the FBI and cyber experts advise that “negotiating with or paying ransom to terrorists is a violation of federal criminal law.” Referring to the attack as terrorism is curious, considering that to date no ransomware attack has been classified as a terrorist act, though threatening to release information on the president may have prompted federal investigators to reclassify it as such, a security researcher last week told SC Media. That researcher said the attackers may have shot themselves in the foot by mentioning Trump and would no longer be unable to collect the ransom, though it probably increased the likelihood they will publish or auction the data. Despite the law firm’s claim to have made a “substantial investment in state-of-the-art technology security,” it seems it let a Pulse Secure VPN security vulnerability – CVE-2019-11510, affecting Citrix products and exploited in the past by the REvil/Sodinokibi attackers – go unpatched for at least six months after an update was provided. Grubman and Sherwood share at least one connection: Both used the services of Coveware to mitigate their attacks, DarkOwl said, pointing to a conversation the attackers had with Coveware that was included in their first Sherwood data dump. “While the threat actors only posted Coveware’s side of the conversation, it is clear that Coveware attempted to negotiate by acting as a middleman between Sherwood, their board and the attackers,” DarkOwl said. “Also of note is that Grubman…also utilized Coveware’s services, which is worth keeping in mind considering these two are supposedly unrelated companies/targets.”",revilsodinokibi ransomwar hacker struck celebr law firm grubman shire meisela sack threaten releas inform client like ladi gaga madonna well presid trump like exploit unpatch citrix vulner turn sight major food compani sherwood forest harvest distributor sherwood awar deal attack week although gone public accord research darkowl said attack post notic onlin friday threaten download eight compani proprietari file preview releas come first link contain around file file contain high sensit data includ cashflow analysi subdistributor info detail insur inform proprietari vendor inform – includ kroger albertson sprout – scan driver licens imag driver distribut network etc research said blog post revil attack recent up activ strike varieti target travel compani dentist offic last week publish file ladi gaga christina aguilera doubl ransom request grubman file million threaten releas damag inform presid trump despit escal threat grubman said would pay ransom note statement fbi cyber expert advis negoti pay ransom terrorist violat feder crimin law refer attack terror curious consid date ransomwar attack classifi terrorist act though threaten releas inform presid may prompt feder investig reclassifi secur research last week told sc medium research said attack may shot foot mention trump would longer unabl collect ransom though probabl increas likelihood publish auction data despit law firm claim made substanti invest stateoftheart technolog secur seem let puls secur vpn secur vulner – cve affect citrix product exploit past revilsodinokibi attack – go unpatch least six month updat provid grubman sherwood share least one connect use servic covewar mitig attack darkowl said point convers attack covewar includ first sherwood data dump threat actor post covewar side convers clear covewar attempt negoti act middleman sherwood board attack darkowl said also note grubman…also util covewar servic worth keep mind consid two suppos unrel companiestarget ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'malware', 'cybercrime', 'data loss', 'fraud']"
149,,"What's Lost, Gained As Black Hat And DEF CON Go Virtual",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31216/Whats-Lost-Gained-As-Black-Hat-And-DEF-CON-Go-Virtual.html,16/05/2020,"As Black Hat and DEF CON organizers, researchers and members of the cyber community scramble to figure out how they can salvage or, better yet, enhance the experience as the events go virtual amid the COVID-19 pandemic, security will be a top priority. Meanwhile, other aspects of the conferences are expected to change more drastically, for better or worse. Organizers of the August 2020 events are aware the remote shows will have to emphasize security, as the new format presents a tempting challenge to adversaries who may want to make a name for themselves by hacking into the shows' remote infrastructure, perhaps hijacking a presentation or disrupting access. While members of the cyber community acknowledged the issue, they don't seem to be fretting it too heavily. ""Sure, there is always a concern, but if cybersecurity conferences can't figure out how to secure their virtual events, well, they probably shouldn't claim to be a cybersecurity conference,"" said Patrick Wardle, a frequent Black Hat/DEF CON presenter, principal security researcher at Jamf, and founder of Objective-See. ""And such conferences already have had to secure their websites and networks at in-person events. And oftentimes such networks were part of a public venue or... belonged to the venue itself, and thus a purely virtual event may be in a way, simpler to secure."" Security is always a priority for the Las Vegas-based conferences. ""To be honest, inviting all the hackers as well as law enforcement in the world to Vegas invites a certain amount of security issues; however, with having it online, those issues will simply be different,"" said Wireless Village organizers Rick Farina and Rick Mellendick, who collectively are operating the venue under the non-profit RF Hackers Sanctuary. ""The shows can, and will, do everything they can to pick reasonably secure platforms. But the truth is, these systems are already out there in wide use and are a major target for corporate- and even state- sponsored espionage right now.  Maybe more hackers being forced to use these platforms will provide a quick boost in security, or at least separate the wheat from the chaff."" DEF CON spokesperson Melanie Ensign told SC Media said ""a lot of decisions are still being made"" in terms of security, ""particularly in regards to which platforms we'll use and how to prepare their internal security teams to be a potential target because of DEF CON."" ""We go through this process in advance of every DEF CON with the host venues' security teams,"" Ensign continued. ""We'll still have our own dedicated security teams working remotely – and right now the DEF CON forums where most of the planning and engagement is already forming, is something that's live year-round and monitored for suspicious activity."" Steve Wylie, Black Hat general manager, added that Black Hat ""will take all necessary steps to keep the platforms we use for our virtual event secure."" Larger changes will be felt as the physical events go remote. A lack of interpersonal interaction means no schmoozing and networking, no up-close sharing of intelligence, no wheeling-and-dealing, and no wandering around the show floor. On the other hand, the new remote format that the two events announced last Friday presents unique opportunities to reach out to a larger audience and experiment with how to present research and engage virtual attendees. ""We're inspired to adapt Black Hat USA in a virtual format that will be available to our entire global community,"" said Wylie, Black Hat general manager. ""Our team is working hard to deliver the same level of high-quality briefings, trainings and business hall programs that Black Hat attendees have come to expect every year."" But how, exactly, will that work? That question goes double for DEF CON, a unique animal among cyber conferences. The show is very hands-on in nature, with 32 ""Villages"" where researchers tinker with everything from cars to drones to IoT devices. DEF CON and Black Hat founder Jeff Moss confirmed on a DEF CON forum post that the DEF CON 28 ""Safe Mode"" edition will feature events such as a new online Mystery Challenge game; remote capture-the-flag competitions; and the Packet Hacking, Red Team and BioHacking Villages. The fate of other Villages remains up in the air. ""We’re still in the process of determining which Villages will be available through the virtual [conference],"" Ensign said. Each ""Village is run independently every year. DEF CON merely provides the space, so it's also up to each individual Village whether or not they want to participate online and how."" One of the most important venues this year would have been the Voting Machine Hacking Village, where white-hats probe for vulnerabilities that attackers could potentially use to disrupt the 2020 presidential election, and perhaps even alter vote tallies. Jake Braun, Voting Machine Hacking Village co-founder and executive director, cyber policy initiative, at the University of Chicago, is determined to host the Village virtually this year in some fashion. However, he is concerned that the remote format could struggle to capture the public's and media's attention, perhaps resulting in lack of awareness and action among government officials when election security flaws present themselves. Just two years ago, the Village was ""covered on every continent on the planet,"" said Braun. ""That's not going to happen this year,"" he predicted. For now, it is also unclear as to what extent Village technologists and vulnerability hunters will have any way to access and analyze voting equipment this time. ""Every year, we got new machines that we didn’t have before, [and] we found new vulnerabilities,"" said Braun. ""This year would have been no different, so obviously we miss out on identifying new vulnerabilities with new machines in advance of the election, which obviously then reduces folks' ability to find new fixes to those vulnerabilities."" Last year, the Village launched a pilot project that offered election officials free security advice from researchers. Dozens of officials showed up on their own dime, said Braun, and it wasn't even a significant election year. ""We were hoping to dramatically expand that, and because we got good feedback from folks who were there, we thought –  since so much of this stuff is word of mouth – we would have seen an increase because of that and 2020 [elections],"" said Braun, author of the book Democracy in Danger. ""And we really wanted to start to open up that line of activity significantly this year for obvious reasons."" Now that can't happen as originally envisioned. On the plus side, Braun recognizes that many officials who cannot afford to travel to Vegas will now be able to attend virtually. ""This is really going to force us to up our game digitally on this, and that will, we think, make these kind of free services to election officials... a lot more easily accessible."" Farina and Mellendick are excited about their revised plans, which includes a virtual wireless capture-the-flag competition that serves as a live training exercise and test environment. The pair said that DEF CON's cancellation and virtualization was the perfect impetus to focus more intently on this contest. ""It may seem impossible to bring the entire world of RF into the homes of the worldwide DEF CON audience,"" the pair said in a joint email interview with SC Media. However, ""We at RF Hackers Sanctuary are viewing this whole thing as a positive."" ""This brief respite from the free-for-all that is a 30,000-person convention in Vegas is giving us the time to build something completely new, which we have been wanting to build for years, Farina and Mellendick continued. ""We are excited to finally build 'Wireless Capture the Flag: The Home Game' to serve not just our DEF CON audience, but also all those who can't travel to the conferences we participate in. ""It is, of course, a disappointment to not be able to see all our friends in Vegas this year, but the learning and sharing will continue, unconstrained by physical size, and likely reaching an even wider audience,"" the pair concluded. Other members of the research community shared similar sentiments that while the virtualized conferences will create a less intimate and tactile experience, it will at least allow for greater outreach. ""A large part of these conferences are the in-person interactions, networking, and parties – so much so that terms such as 'lobby con' have been coined,"" said Wardle. ""Clearly, a virtual event can't have these same components – well, in any comparable sense."" However, the ""main goal of such events is generally to allow speakers and an audience to interact together... This of course can be done virtually!"" continued Wardle, widely known for his macOS research. Past Black Hat and DEF CON events seemingly were bursting at the seams with attendees crowding into hallways and forming endless queues to get into sessions. Now, there potentially are no capacity issues, and attendance is open to all. Wardle said the remote format ""inherently makes the talks and content more widely available... assuming the conference fully live-streams it freely. For example, those that could not travel to these events can now virtually attend. And others, who perhaps avoided such events due to other reasons such as social anxieties – well now, they can virtually attend from the comfort of their homes, safely and anonymously."" Law enforcement agencies are also well represented at Black Hat and DEF CON, where federal agents would typically gather to share intelligence and engage in dialogue with security professionals, private-sector members and the greater hacker community. Not this year though. ""It's really just about knowledge and thought leadership, because you do have some of the brightest and the smartest savvy folks in the room,"" said Robert Rodriguez, chairman and founder of the Security Innovation Network (SINET) – a former special agent with the U.S. Secret Service, and a frequent Black Hat attendee. ""You do, over time, build relations with those folks... and then they share information to a certain degree,"" said Rodriguez. ""But it just depends on how much trust you can build. I think that the element of trust is critical in life."" With no fraternization, ""that will get lost."" ""You [can] never replace a handshake,"" he added. SC Media asked Rodriguez if the lack of a physical show also impairs the ability of federal agents or investigators who wish to closely monitor or gather intelligence on elements of the cybercriminal community who may emerge from the shadows to attend these shows. After all, certain attendees have been known to play ""spot the fed,"" attempting to identify agents and intel officials walking around in plain clothes. And, of course, there was the infamous 2017 arrest of hacker Marcus Hutchins, which took place in Las Vegas where he had just attended the Black Hat and DEF CON conferences. Rodriguez downplayed this angle, saying law enforcement officials attend the shows first and foremost to learn and share knowledge. Getting a closer look at subjects of interest is more of a secondary benefit. ""That's just natural work in law enforcement. If the bad guy's over there, then that's where they’re going to go."" And losing the ability to do that this year is no ""not a big deal,"" he opined.

150,,MobiFriends Data For 3.6 Million Users Gets Leaked,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31198/MobiFriends-Data-For-3.6-Million-Users-Gets-Leaked.html,11/05/2020,"The leaked personal data of more than 3.6 million users registered on dating site MobiFriends was made all the more vulnerable because the site used the notoriously weak MD5 hashing. “It is always troubling to hear about passwords being stolen in a data breach, especially when the stolen passwords are hashed with MD5,which is infamous for no longer being cryptographically secure,” said ForgeRock Senior Vice President Ben Goodman. He pointed out that four of five global breaches stem from weak or stolen passwords with the problem exacerbated by users reusing username and password combinations. In this case, the compromised user credentials could unlock nearly 10 million accounts due to rampant password reuse,” said Vinay Sridhara, CTO at Balbix , citing a recent company report that “found that the average password is reused 2.7 times, and the average user is sharing 8 passwords between work and personal accounts.” The information posted online – including mobile numbers, usernames, birthdates and app activity – was nicked during a January 2019 breach. ”The leaked data sets are currently available in a non-restricted manner despite being originally offered for sale,”  according to researchers at Risk Based Security (RBS). “The compromised data sets were originally posted for sale on a prominent deep web hacking forum on January 12th, 2020 by a threat actor named ‘DonJuji’ and attributed to a January 2019 breach event,” the researchers wrote in a blog post, noting another threat actor on the same forum shared the data “in a non-restricted manner” April 12 of this year. Some of the information came from professional email accounts associated with American International Group (AIG), Experian, Walmart, Virgin Media and other Fortune 1000 companies. “It appears that at least some MobiFriends employees used their work email addresses as well, so it's entirely likely that full login credentials for employee accounts are amongst the nearly 4 million sets of compromised credentials,” said Sridhara.  Fausto Oliveira, principal security architect at Acceptto, said that threat actors were able to access the data in the first place, and went undetected until the data appeared on the Internet, raises questions about how strong the security controls were that protected that data.”",leak person data million user regist date site mobifriend made vulner site use notori weak md hash alway troubl hear password stolen data breach especi stolen password hash md infam longer cryptograph secur said forgerock senior vice presid ben goodman point four five global breach stem weak stolen password problem exacerb user reus usernam password combin case compromis user credenti could unlock near million account due rampant password reus said vinay sridhara cto balbix cite recent compani report found averag password reus time averag user share password work person account inform post onlin – includ mobil number usernam birthdat app activ – nick januari breach leak data set current avail nonrestrict manner despit origin offer sale accord research risk base secur rb compromis data set origin post sale promin deep web hack forum januari th threat actor name ‘ donjuji attribut januari breach event research wrote blog post note anoth threat actor forum share data nonrestrict manner april year inform came profession email account associ american intern group aig experian walmart virgin medium fortun compani appear least mobifriend employe use work email address well s entir like full login credenti employe account amongst near million set compromis credenti said sridhara fausto oliveira princip secur architect acceptto said threat actor abl access data first place went undetect data appear internet rais question strong secur control protect data ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'privacy', 'data loss']"
151,,"Google, Apple Tighten Protections On Contact Tracing",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31156/Google-Apple-Tighten-Protections-On-Contact-Tracing.html,28/04/2020,"As the likes of Google and Apple bolster privacy in the race to come up with contact tracing apps to get a handle on the spread of COVID-19, Americans are placing a premium on safeguarding their data with only 27 percent in one study saying they would give permission to an app to track their location. Apple and Google have fast-tracked development of an API that can be used to build Bluetooth-based contact tracking app, which they’re now soft-pedaling as an “exposure notification” tool. The companies plan to release the API on schedule in May and offer a platform intended exclusively for public health agencies to develop apps in the next couple of months. The duo released details of measures they’ve taken to ensure privacy, including limiting the time that devices should be in close proximity to exchange keys to 30 minutes and encrypting device metadata. Google and Apple have agreed “to collect analytics from people’s dynamics in order to feed their epidemiology models to achieve two things: keep people aware of possible exposure to someone infected and predict how and where the curve of infection may develop,” said Gonzalo Raposo, tech manager at Globant, who noted that using technology to track dynamics in society has been successful. “There are still challenges to overcome, but this first step sounds promising.” The latest steps to ensure privacy are intended to allay growing fears that contact tracing apps will expose users or be misused. A large majority of Americans – 89 percent – said they support or strongly support privacy rights, a CyberNews.com survey found. The number of those willing to let an app display location if they were infected ticked up to 30 percent but most – 79 percent – worried that the government wouldn’t continue to use what they consider intrusive tracking measures well after the pandemic has been quashed. Rights groups like the ACLU have stressed that coronavirus tracing apps should be limited to the confines of the current pandemic, with the APIs expiring once the health emergency has ended, and have cautioned against the development of general purpose apps that aiming to track any illness that might crop up. The press to stop the spread of COVID-19, though, “has created a new justification to increase surveillance, an excuse that governments and businesses are exploiting,” said SaltStack CTO and cofounder Thomas Hatch. “When all is said and done, not only does this damage privacy, but I don't see a rollback without an aggressive push after COVID-19 to roll back these recent changes.” Despite the promise of the Apple/Google initiative, the BBC said the U.K.’s NHS has nixed the plans in favor of a centralized contact tracing model instead, raising privacy concerns. “With all the discussion that is taking place worldwide about ways to ensure public health and safety, guidelines would certainly provide a useful starting point for the tracking, tracing and testing so necessary to fight the Coronavirus pandemic,” said Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum.  “The fundamental issues for me that need to be addressed are transparency and building in privacy to any technology solution or approach from the outset – privacy by design in other words,” said Durbin. “The notion of only storing data for as long as you need it and protecting it at all stages of the information lifecycle will strike a chord with information security professionals worldwide who for many years have been adopting this mantra to safeguard confidential data.” ",like googl appl bolster privaci race come contact trace app get handl spread covid american place premium safeguard data percent one studi say would give permiss app track locat appl googl fasttrack develop api use build bluetoothbas contact track app softped exposur notif tool compani plan releas api schedul may offer platform intend exclus public health agenc develop app next coupl month duo releas detail measur taken ensur privaci includ limit time devic close proxim exchang key minut encrypt devic metadata googl appl agre collect analyt peopl dynam order feed epidemiolog model achiev two thing keep peopl awar possibl exposur someon infect predict curv infect may develop said gonzalo raposo tech manag globant note use technolog track dynam societi success still challeng overcom first step sound promis latest step ensur privaci intend allay grow fear contact trace app expos user misus larg major american – percent – said support strong support privaci right cybernewscom survey found number will let app display locat infect tick percent – percent – worri govern continu use consid intrus track measur well pandem quash right group like aclu stress coronavirus trace app limit confin current pandem api expir health emerg end caution develop general purpos app aim track ill might crop press stop spread covid though creat new justif increas surveil excus govern busi exploit said saltstack cto cofound thoma hatch said done damag privaci nt see rollback without aggress push covid roll back recent chang despit promis applegoogl initi bbc said uk nh nix plan favor central contact trace model instead rais privaci concern discuss take place worldwid way ensur public health safeti guidelin would certain provid use start point track trace test necessari fight coronavirus pandem said steve durbin manag director inform secur forum fundament issu need address transpar build privaci technolog solut approach outset – privaci design word said durbin notion store data long need protect stage inform lifecycl strike chord inform secur profession worldwid mani year adopt mantra safeguard confidenti data ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'privacy', 'virus', 'phone', 'google', 'apple']"
152,,"Global COVID-19 Apps Suffering From Flaws, Malicious Copycats",https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31102/Global-COVID-19-Apps-Suffering-From-Flaws-Malicious-Copycats.html,"/04/7,","As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, so does the use of risky mobile applications designed to help track the outbreak. Some of these apps already present troubling privacy implications due to their ability to track the movements of local citizens and collect information on them. But beyond that, they may also be saddled with vulnerabilities, or have been ripped off by copycats, perhaps for nefarious purposes. Indeed, researchers from the ZeroFOX Alpha Team on Monday reported finding suspicious or even outright malicious versions of government-sanctioned COVID-19 mobile applications in Iran and Italy. Users in these countries -- both among the hardest hit by the virus -- are likely downloading these versions from untrustworthy third-party sources instead of from the official app store. ""A greater number of government-sanctioned applications causes users to be less certain of which applications are legitimate,"" says the blog post report. ""Threat actors have taken advantage of this confusion, and have released malicious applications... to prey on users who may mistakenly download the malicious app. To prevent this and protect their citizens, it is highly important that governments ensure consistency with where applications are able to be downloaded, and even with their appearance."" The same research team also discovered that a legitimate, government-approved mobile app in Colombia contained an encryption flaw that could have allowed attackers to intercept sensitive user information in clear text. In the Italian case, Alpha Team found 12 malicious APKs impersonating a genuine app from developer SoftMining called SM-Covid-19. The campaign is designed to infect users with backdoor malware that starts after an Android device reboots. According to the report, the campaign leverages reverse TCP tunnels, the Metasploit penetration testing framework and msfvenom tools to infect individuals. The copycat Iranian app, meanwhile, is somewhat unusual because it's unclear to what degree the fake app is any more dangerous than the actual government-sponsored one, which is available via the Iranian app store Cafe Bazaar. ZeroFOX doesn't name the official Iranian program, but based on various reports, it is likely the ""AC19"" app, which has been compared to surveillanceware for its heavy-handed approach toward tracking the country's citizens and harvesting personal information. The fake version -- named CoronaApp and available for download from a website listed in various news websites, Telegram groups and social network posts -- does much of the same, the researchers said. ""Alpha Team has analyzed the unofficial CoronaApp, and although no evidence of ill-intent was identified, the app does request permissions to access a user's location, camera, internet data, system information and write to external storage,"" the report states. ""Intrusive permissions are not necessarily an indication of something malicious, but rather, this particular collection of permissions demonstrates the likely intent of the developer to access sensitive user information."" Indeed, by allowing all the permissions, the application is able to exfiltrate details related to a device's ID, IP address, MAC address, geolocation, language, active default data network, connection status, supported network types and more. The app's code libraries arouse suspicion as well, and to make matters worse it does not does not use Transport Layer Security (TLS) for data transfer. For that reason, Alpha Team ""assesses with HIGH confidence that this application can be abused in the future,"" the report concludes. The researchers also found a legitimate, official coronavirus app that was similarly lacking in TLS security -- the Colombian COVID-19 mobile app ""CoronApp-Colombia."" The app reportedly was insecurely communicating with the API server throughout the app workflow, using HTTP instead of HTTPS. ZeroFOX said that after it alerted the Colombian CERT on March 26, the developer fixed the problem just days later. Prior to the security update, ""ZeroFOX Alpha Team installed the app on an Android Emulator and captured traffic going to this server with Wireshark. We successfully created a user in the app, and captured all the information (PII and PHI) over cleartext, demonstrating the ease with which an attacker could man-in-the-middle this traffic.

153,,GOP Canvassing App Credentials Exposed In Code Repository,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31077/GOP-Canvassing-App-Credentials-Exposed-In-Code-Repository.html,31/03/2020,"Access credentials for Campaign Sidekick app, used by Republican
campaigns for voter contacts, surveys and canvassing, were exposed in a code
repository within a publicly accessible .git directory, a version control
system that records code base changes during software development so that
developers can work from the same code.   “The same operations that make git useful for software
development, however, also make it possible for code to be exposed when
self-hosted git folders are misconfigured,” according to researchers at UpGuard
who discovered the repository in February and reported in a blog post
that it has since been secured. When a .git directory is configured for public
accessibility, as was the case for files hosted on campaignsidekick.vote,
anyone in the world can view all code and its history.” Source code and credentials for the GOP app –  including code change history since November 2016 – were found in the directory.  “Additionally, the data exposed in this project included credentials for accessing the CPanel (website administration software) and Secure File Transfer Protocol servers of another U.S. elections-related company, Voter Gravity,”  the researchers wrote. The scripts reveal how data was collated from sources like Facebook and “included identifying details of software developers working on the project who were located within, and residents of, India.”  Republicans have been using Campaign Sidekick, originally
referred to as Surge Data Technologies, since 2002 as campaigns moved away from
paper for large-scale canvassing. The Campaign Sidekick repository also housed other credentials that bad actors could have “abused to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data provided to and from their service, including a configuration file that included the app ID and secret key for a Facebook app, an API key and password for a CHargify account,” UpGuard said. Noting  political campaign staffs’ reliance on a “broad
ecosystem of third parties” and just how easy it is for attackers to access
sensitive data via vulnerable third parties Kelly White, CEO at RiskRecon, ‘it
only takes one mistake within a single app to expose sensitive voter data.” White stressed that organizations that maintain election integrity must better “understand the security practices of all parties in the data chain of custody and hold those parties accountable.” Campaign- and election-related apps are under scrutiny after the largely untested IowaReporterApp led to the state party’s vote counting woes during the Iowa caucuses and the Elector Election Day app used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party exposed personal data on more than 6.4 million Israelis – in other words, the entirety of the country’s voter database.   ",access credenti campaign sidekick app use republican campaign voter contact survey canvass expos code repositori within public access git directori version control system record code base chang softwar develop develop work code oper make git use softwar develop howev also make possibl code expos selfhost git folder misconfigur accord research upguard discov repositori februari report blog post sinc secur git directori configur public access case file host campaignsidekickvot anyon world view code histori sourc code credenti gop app – includ code chang histori sinc novemb – found directori addit data expos project includ credenti access cpanel websit administr softwar secur file transfer protocol server anoth u electionsrel compani voter graviti research wrote script reveal data collat sourc like facebook includ identifi detail softwar develop work project locat within resid india republican use campaign sidekick origin refer surg data technolog sinc campaign move away paper largescal canvass campaign sidekick repositori also hous credenti bad actor could abus compromis confidenti integr data provid servic includ configur file includ app id secret key facebook app api key password chargifi account upguard said note polit campaign staff relianc broad ecosystem third parti easi attack access sensit data via vulner third parti kelli white ceo riskrecon ‘ take one mistak within singl app expos sensit voter data white stress organ maintain elect integr must better understand secur practic parti data chain custodi hold parti account campaign electionrel app scrutini larg untest iowareporterapp led state parti vote count woe iowa caucus elector elect day app use isra prime minist benjamin netanyahu likud parti expos person data million isra – word entireti countri voter databas ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'privacy', 'usa', 'data loss']"
154,,Tupperware Site Hacked With Credit Card Skimmer,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31061/Tupperware-Site-Hacked-With-Credit-Card-Skimmer.html,26/03/2020,"Tupperware hasn’t yet put
a lid on a targeted cyberattack that uses a credit card skimmer to collect
customer payment information at checkout on the tupperware[.]com site and some
of its local sites. The threat actors hid “malicious code within an image file that
activates a fraudulent payment form during the checkout process,” according to researchers
at Malwarebytes who discovered the compromise March 20. “This form collects
customer payment data via a digital credit card skimmer and passes it on to the
cybercriminals with Tupperware shoppers none-the-wiser.” The Tupperware party long ago moved to the internet – with more
than one million people visiting the company’s website monthly. And as COVID-19
virus drives more people online to shop, the researchers wrote in a Wednesday
blog post
that “there is little doubt that a larger number of transactions will be
impacted by credit card skimmers,” one of the top web threats they monitor. The
actors behind the Tupperware compromise put effort behind integrating the
skimmer seamlessly and remain undetected. Malwarebytes found the malicious
activity during a web crawl after coming across a suspicious iframe loaded from
deskofhelp[.]com when visiting the retailer’s checkout page and which displays
the payment form fields used by shoppers.    The domain was registered on March 9 using an email address with
Russian provider Yandex and found alongside other phishing domains. The hackers’ scheme weren’t meticulous, though. “The attackers didn’t carefully consider (or perhaps didn’t care about) how the malicious form should look on localized pages,” the researchers wrote, noting that while the Spanish version of the Tupperware site is written in Spanish, the rogue payment form remained in English. Malwarebytes notified Tupperware of its findings but the skimmer was still active when the company published its findings today. “Typically, when it comes to a website hack, an organization needs to react fast and either temporarily disable their site or quickly remove the offending code,” Jerome Segura,  director of threat intelligence, Malwarebytes Labs told SC Media. But the security challenge
doesn't stop there. “Attackers can return hours later and place new code,” said
Segura. Site owners should perform a full
security sweep to identify the root cause and tease out backdoors and other
artifacts. Breaches often occur because a vulnerability is left unpatched.  But “due to the nature of content management
systems and their plugins, the patching process is not always straightforward,”
said Segura. “Most e-commerce companies should have a security contact form or better, a security.txt file, on their site,” he said. “This makes reporting breaches easier and ensures that the time to remediate is as short as possible.” 

 UPDATE 3/27: After learning of “a potential security incident involving unauthorized code” on its U.S. and Canadian ecommerce sites, Tupperware said in a statement sent to SC Media that it “promptly launched an investigation, took steps to remove the unauthorized code, and a leading data security forensics firm was engaged to assist in the investigation.” While the company said it’s too early to offer
additional details, it anticipates “providing all necessary notifications as we
get further clarity about the specific timeframes and orders that may have been
involved” as it pursues the “matter quickly to resolution.” ",tupperwar yet put lid target cyberattack us credit card skimmer collect custom payment inform checkout tupperwar com site local site threat actor hid malici code within imag file activ fraudul payment form checkout process accord research malwarebyt discov compromis march form collect custom payment data via digit credit card skimmer pass cybercrimin tupperwar shopper nonethewis tupperwar parti long ago move internet – one million peopl visit compani websit month covid virus drive peopl onlin shop research wrote wednesday blog post littl doubt larger number transact impact credit card skimmer one top web threat monitor actor behind tupperwar compromis put effort behind integr skimmer seamless remain undetect malwarebyt found malici activ web crawl come across suspici ifram load deskofhelp com visit retail checkout page display payment form field use shopper domain regist march use email address russian provid yandex found alongsid phish domain hacker scheme meticul though attack care consid perhap care malici form look local page research wrote note spanish version tupperwar site written spanish rogu payment form remain english malwarebyt notifi tupperwar find skimmer still activ compani publish find today typic come websit hack organ need react fast either temporarili disabl site quick remov offend code jerom segura director threat intellig malwarebyt lab told sc medium secur challeng nt stop attack return hour later place new code said segura site owner perform full secur sweep identifi root caus teas backdoor artifact breach often occur vulner left unpatch due natur content manag system plugin patch process alway straightforward said segura ecommerc compani secur contact form better securitytxt file site said make report breach easier ensur time remedi short possibl updat learn potenti secur incid involv unauthor code u canadian ecommerc site tupperwar said statement sent sc medium prompt launch investig took step remov unauthor code lead data secur forens firm engag assist investig compani said earli offer addit detail anticip provid necessari notif get clariti specif timefram order may involv pursu matter quick resolut ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'hacker', 'bank', 'cybercrime', 'fraud']"
155,,COVID-19 Exposes Gaps In Cybersecurity Safety Net As Millions WFH,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31057/COVID-19-Exposes-Gaps-In-Cybersecurity-Safety-Net-As-Millions-WFH.html,25/03/2020,"Apply pressure to any system - and its weakness become apparent. COVID-19 has exerted the necessary pressure to test cybersecurity postures, exposing gaps - some of them yawning, some more subtle - as entire workforces have been ordered to work from home. As the novel coronavirus escaped the confines of China earlier this year and it became increasingly clear large numbers of workers would have to hunker down at home, all eyes turned to an obvious potential weak spot - VPNs, which would surely sputter under the stress. But as the virus spread it has exposed additional security problems, ranging from the inability to do forensic tests and general upkeep on systems to granter higher level user privileges to staff to access systems remotely. Organizations which previously did not have a distributed workforce quickly learned their tools on hand were not designed or intended to work safely offsite, via a VPN or over the internet, said Lisa Davies, head of corporate security at Redox, preventing security and IT teams from conducting even routine, but important, tasks. ""Since many of the security controls and tools used by non-distributed companies depend on being on the local network, they cannot do [many] things remotely,"" Davies said. ""These companies have found it more difficult to update, monitor logs etc unless the device is on the local network, so when employees take them home, they are in the dark."" Company equipment left behind as workers fled has languished unmonitored, their vulnerability magnified as employees, outside the sight lines of security teams, connect their own, unsecure devices to company assets. Organizations must “monitor inactive company devices, as possible indicators a device has an issue, or a remote worker may be tempted to use personal technology,"" said Davies. ""This goes hand-in-hand with technical controls preventing non-company devices from accessing sensitive information.” The new working order has cast a harsh light on the limitations and safeguards of connectivity, required for business to function. Existing protocols simply are not sufficient, said Luke Willadsen, security consultant, cybersecurity services and solutions firm EmberSec. It appears support for multifactor authentication has been a lot of talk and not quite as much action. Many companies apparently haven't required it to connect to the network then disable the work computer’s ability to take a screenshot of the window containing the remote/virtual desktop on the host computer, Willadsen said. That needs to change quickly. “Don’t let any data pass between the machine originating the connection and the remote/virtual desktop,"" Willadsen said. Security teams can bridge this gap by disabling ""the clipboard and shared drive access between the origination host and the virtual/remote system,"" he said, noting ""we don’t want a single byte of information to be exchanged between the two hosts (aside from the network connection that facilitates the session)."" That will prevent ""the introduction of malware into your network and it prevents employees from exfiltrating confidential or proprietary files,” he said. Pre-coronavirus, supervisors didn't have to concern themselves with employee distractions - children running around, barking dogs, fears of a deadly virus's spread or many other things occurring in a normal household. But now, employ focus is paramount. Workers be reminded to stay focused and that security policies put in place to protect corporate information are still in place, especially in a world filled with phishing emails designed to prey on those now operating in a busy and confusing world. “They should also build mechanisms to reinforce such policies in the moment they most need to followed – for example within the context of an email asking for financial action or confidential information – so that users can make informed decisions before interacting with suspicious emails,"" said Matt Petrosky, vice president of customer experience, GreatHorn. By providing employees with reminders about policies when it matters, companies can significantly reduce risk for their remote workforce.""",appli pressur system weak becom appar covid exert necessari pressur test cybersecur postur expos gap yawn subtl entir workforc order work home novel coronavirus escap confin china earlier year becam increas clear larg number worker would hunker home eye turn obvious potenti weak spot vpns would sure sputter stress virus spread expos addit secur problem rang inabl forens test general upkeep system granter higher level user privileg staff access system remot organ previous distribut workforc quick learn tool hand design intend work safe offsit via vpn internet said lisa davi head corpor secur redox prevent secur team conduct even routin import task sinc mani secur control tool use nondistribut compani depend local network mani thing remot davi said compani found difficult updat monitor log etc unless devic local network employe take home dark compani equip left behind worker fled languish unmonitor vulner magnifi employe outsid sight line secur team connect unsecur devic compani asset organ must monitor inact compani devic possibl indic devic issu remot worker may tempt use person technolog said davi go handinhand technic control prevent noncompani devic access sensit inform new work order cast harsh light limit safeguard connect requir busi function exist protocol simpli suffici said luke willadsen secur consult cybersecur servic solut firm embersec appear support multifactor authent lot talk quit much action mani compani appar nt requir connect network disabl work comput abil take screenshot window contain remotevirtu desktop host comput willadsen said need chang quick let data pas machin origin connect remotevirtu desktop willadsen said secur team bridg gap disabl clipboard share drive access origin host virtualremot system said note want singl byte inform exchang two host asid network connect facilit session prevent introduct malwar network prevent employe exfiltr confidenti proprietari file said precoronavirus supervisor nt concern employe distract child run around bark dog fear dead virus s spread mani thing occur normal household employ focus paramount worker remind stay focus secur polici put place protect corpor inform still place especi world fill phish email design prey oper busi confus world also build mechan reinforc polici moment need follow – exampl within context email ask financi action confidenti inform – user make inform decis interact suspici email said matt petroski vice presid custom experi greathorn provid employe remind polici matter compani signific reduc risk remot workforc ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'virus']"
156,,FSB Contractor Breach Exposes Secret Cyber Weapons Program,https://packetstormsecurity.com/news/view/31052/FSB-Contractor-Breach-Exposes-Secret-Cyber-Weapons-Program.html,24/03/2020,"The hack of an FSB contractor has exposed details of the Russian
intelligence agency’s cyber weapons program aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities
in IoT devices. Digital Revolution, a Russian hacking group, has claimed credit
for the April 2019 breach of subcontractor ODT
(Oday) LLC, which was working with frequent Russian Ministry of Internal
Affairs contractor InformInvestGroup CJSC, and published 12 technical documents
revealing what the FSB has dubbed the Fronton Program. Inspired by the Mirai botnet, the program developed in 2017
and 2018, according to a ZDNet report,
suggests creating an IoT botnet for the FSB marshalling devices – particularly internet
security cameras and digital recorders – that still use default logon credentials
or easy-to-crack user names and passwords. Once pulled into the botnet, the devices could be used to
execute DDoS attacks. ""If they transmit video, they have a
sufficiently large communication channel to effectively perform DDoS,""
the report cited an expose
by BBC Russia as saying. The FSB’s unit 64829, or FSB Information Security Center, apparently placed a procurement order for the project. “This is the first time the use of IoT botnets by nation-state actors has been revealed as fact,” said Ben Seri, vice president of research at Armis. “This illustrates the tip of the iceberg in terms of IoT attacks taking place in the wild by a wide array of threat actors.” But the technique of taking advantage of unsecured IoT devices, to create a powerful army of devices that can carry out massive DDoS attacks is tried and true. “This leak shows a few critical things. First, how certain nation state actors may use this technique to carry out similar DDoS attacks,” said Seri. “Second, how they may distance their core operation from it, in an attempt to hide behind the benign looking IoT devices.” Finally, he contended, this is only the beginning, “given that IoT
devices represent the easiest route into a business.”  This isn’t the first time the FSB has suffered
an embarrassing breach. Hackers reportedly stole
7.5 TB of data from the intelligence service’s contractor SyTech, which
revealed details on several of its activities or prospective projects,
including the collecting of information on users of social media services Tor
and P2P networks. SyTech,
has worked for FSB’s radio-electronic intelligence unit 71330 since 2009. The
July 13 breach reportedly exposed details on “Nautilus,” a plan to gather
information on users of Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and similar services;
“Nautilius-S,” a project to deanonymize Tor traffic using Tor servers; and
“Reward,” a scheme to secretly penetrate P2P networks.",hack fsb contractor expos detail russian intellig agenc cyber weapon program aim exploit vulner iot devic digit revolut russian hack group claim credit april breach subcontractor odt oday llc work frequent russian ministri intern affair contractor informinvestgroup cjsc publish technic document reveal fsb dub fronton program inspir mirai botnet program develop accord zdnet report suggest creat iot botnet fsb marshal devic – particular internet secur camera digit record – still use default logon credenti easytocrack user name password pull botnet devic could use execut ddos attack transmit video suffici larg communic channel effect perform ddos report cite expos bbc russia say fsb unit fsb inform secur center appar place procur order project first time use iot botnet nationst actor reveal fact said ben seri vice presid research armi illustr tip iceberg term iot attack take place wild wide array threat actor techniqu take advantag unsecur iot devic creat power armi devic carri massiv ddos attack tri true leak show critic thing first certain nation state actor may use techniqu carri similar ddos attack said seri second may distanc core oper attempt hide behind benign look iot devic final contend begin given iot devic repres easiest rout busi first time fsb suffer embarrass breach hacker report stole tb data intellig servic contractor sytech reveal detail sever activ prospect project includ collect inform user social medium servic tor pp network sytech work fsb radioelectron intellig unit sinc juli breach report expos detail nautilus plan gather inform user facebook myspac linkedin similar servic nautiliuss project deanonym tor traffic use tor server reward scheme secret penetr pp network ,"{'url': 'http://www.scmagazine.com/', 'label': 'SC Magazine'}","['headline', 'government', 'russia', 'cyberwar']"
