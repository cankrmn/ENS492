        "raw text": "SquirrelWaffle \u2013 the newish malware loader that first showed up in September \u2013 once again got its scrabbly little claws into an unpatched Microsoft Exchange server to spread malspam with its tried-and-true trick of hijacking email threads.That\u2019s the same-old, same-old, as in, a SquirrelWaffle campaign will hijack an email thread to increase the chances that a victim will click on malicious links. Those rigged links are tucked into an email reply, similar to how the virulent Emotet malware \u2013 typically spread via malicious emails or text messages \u2013 has operated.But this time, the operators added a twist: They sucked knowledge out of an email thread and used it to trick the target into a money transfer.They almost pulled it off. The targeted organization initiated a money transfer to an attacker-controlled account, but thankfully, one of the financial institutions involved in the transaction smelled a rat and flagged the deal as fraudulent.In a Tuesday post, Sophos analysts Matthew Everts and Stephen McNally said that typically, in SquirrelWaffle attacks \u2013 which typically entail the threat actors walking through holes left by unpatched, notorious, oft-picked-apart ProxyLogon and ProxyShell Exchange server vulnerabilities \u2013 the attack ends when those holes finally get patched, removing the attacker\u2019s ability to send emails through the server.But in this recent engagement, the Sophos Rapid Response team found that while a SquirrelWaffle malspam campaign was wreaking havoc on an unpatched server, that same vulnerable server was being used by the attackers to siphon off knowledge from a stolen email thread and to launch a financial fraud attack.\u201cThe combination of Squirrelwaffle, ProxyLogon, and ProxyShell has been encountered by the Sophos Rapid Response team multiple times in the last few months, but this is the first time we have seen attackers use typo-squatting to maintain the ability to send spam once the Exchange server has been remediated,\u201d the analysts wrote.Too Late to Patch That Leaky Exchange RoofIn this case, patching Exchange wouldn\u2019t have clipped SquirrelWaffle\u2019s tail, the analysts said, given that the attackers had already spirited away an email thread about customer payments from the victim\u2019s Exchange server.Besides which, as the analysts noted and as Sophos detailed last March, patching isn\u2019t the end-all, be-all for remediating vulnerable Exchange servers. For one thing, you also need to determine whether attackers have pulled off any other mischief, such as installing webshells.Typosquatting Their Way Into InboxesThe double-up attack on the vulnerable Exchange server started with the attackers registering a typosquat domain. In other words, they registered a domain name that resembled the victim\u2019s legitimate domain but with a small typo, then used email addresses from the look-alike domain to reply to the email thread.\u201cMoving the conversation out of the victim\u2019s email infrastructure gave the attackers operational control over what happened next,\u201d Everts and McNally explained.What happened next was that the attackers tried to divert the victim\u2019s customer\u2019s payments to accounts they controlled. In their hunt for legitimacy, they went so far as to copy more email addresses, to make it look like they were requesting support from an internal department. But these additional email addresses were just as bogus, being sent with the same almost, not-quite, look-alike typosquat domain.Next, they started using \u201cthis transaction\u2019s ready to go!\u201d language, as in the screen capture Sophos provided below.Source: Sophos.Next came some foot-tappingly stern language to ratchet up the urgency, as shown in the next screen grab. \u201cI appreciate how busy you are,\u201d the crooks crooned, among other things that sounded like legitimate accounting blah-blah-blah, \u201cbut wondered if you could give me an update regarding the renewal?\u201dSource: Sophos.The attackers\u2019 fake accountant faux-relaxed after the SquirrelWaffle operators received an email indicating that the illegitimate payment was being processed, assuring their mark that they\u2019d get them an invoice ASAP.Source: Sophos.How to Cage This Twitchy RodentSophos offered advice on how to protect against malicious email attacks such as the SquirrelWaffle campaign, the first of which is a head-desk-bang-bang clich\u00e9: Namely, patch those servers.\u201cThe single biggest step defenders can take to prevent the compromise and abuse of on premises Microsoft Exchange servers is to ensure that they have been patched with the most recent updates from Microsoft,\u201d according to the post.Also:Implement industry standards for email authentication, such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance, in order to make it easier for other organizations to figure out if emails are legitimate. \u201cUsing these standards can make it harder for an attacker to send spoofed emails impersonating your domain,\u201d Sophos said.Consider email security products that integrate artificial intelligence to help fend off increasingly sophisticated social engineering attacks, phishing lures and impersonation messages.Protect the recipients of such emails and ensure that users in your organization can spot phishing attempts and know how to report and respond to them.Sophos also provided tips on what to do if your organization has already been attacked. In fact, it\u2019s put together a Squirrelwaffle Incident Guide to help victims investigate, analyze and respond.Join Threatpost on Wed.

        "raw text": "Scammers are taking full advantage of the launch of Google\u2019s new TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, which has turned out to be an awesome tool for feeding billions of engaged viewers stolen content. That content is being used to run rackets like promoting adult dating websites, hustling diet pills and selling marked-up goods, researchers warned.YouTube Shorts is still in beta, but that\u2019s still given scammers plenty of time to migrate their best TikTok-tested flimflams over to the Google universe, conveniently already populated by billions of users.Tenable analyst Satnam Narang has been studying social media for more than a decade and found that scammers are having wild success lifting TikTok\u2019s most viral videos and using them on YouTube Shorts, to get viewers to click on a variety of sites and links.Narang analyzed 50 different YouTube channels and found as of December, they had racked up 3.2 billion views across at least 38,293 videos stolen from TikTok creators. The YouTube channels reached more than 3 million subscribers, he added.\u201cPlease note this is not an exhaustive list, so the figures shared here are likely an undercount of the true numbers of views, videos and subscribers amassed by scammers using stolen content from TikTok,\u201d Narang added.TikTok challenges like \u201cWear It Big\u201d and \u201cWhy Aren\u2019t You in Uniform\u201d have already racked up billions of views, so serving them to a new Google user base has proved an effective way for fraudsters to supercharge existing TikTok hustles.The most common fraud Narang found was using wildly popular videos from TikTok, primarily challenges featuring beautiful women (like \u201cBuss It\u201d), which serves links to adult dating sites running affiliate programs that pay for clicks.Source: Tenable.\u201cWhile adult-dating scams proliferate across many platforms, the introduction of YouTube Shorts, with its enormous potential reach and built-in audience, is fertile ground that will only serve to help these scams become even more widespread,\u201d Narang explained. \u201cThis trend is alarming because of how successful these tactics have become so quickly on YouTube Shorts, based on the volume of video views and subscribers on these fake channels promoting stolen content.\u201dSource: Tenable.YouTube Shorts viewers were also served advertisements alongside viral TikTok workout videos for trending products \u2014 like the pants simply known as \u201cthe leggings\u201d across social media. Outfitted with a seam up the back to enhance even the flattest posterior, the famous leggings were being sold on YouTube Shorts at a markup by scammers hoping the fresh crop of shoppers won\u2019t notice the padded price, Narang found.\u201cFor instance, I found a similar pair of leggings on AliExpress offered for $12 less than on the Fashion Leggings page,\u201d he said. \u201cThe major concern with these advertisements is that scammers cannot guarantee the item being purchased will arrive or arrive as advertised.\u201dBesides the magic pants, workout-related content stolen from TikTok is used to sell to sell weight-loss programs, diet pills and more, asking for credit-card details.Another scam takes advantage of an affiliate program with a lucrative payment structure to push a smoothie diet. Narang estimated scammers could get up to $100 for every customer who ultimately bought into the program:Influencer \u2018Clout\u2019 Fraud Popular TikTok videos are also being used across YouTube Shorts just to build engagement and follower counts, which Narang explained is a form of social-media currency that is used to sell advertising and earn affiliate money for views.\u201cFor example, one user has received over 78 million views on their channel, but if you look at a breakdown of their actual content, it\u2019s the videos that they did\u00a0not\u00a0create that have the greatest engagement numbers,\u201d Narang said. \u201cThere are also a number of YouTube channels that have been created solely as hubs for stolen TikTok content, similarly, to gain social currency.\u201dHe added that the fraud also puts legitimate content creators at an unfair disadvantage.\u201cAs a platform, YouTube provides creators with avenues to make money through advertisements and brand deals that are often tied to subscriber counts,\u201d Narang said. \u201cAs YouTube and other platforms have sought to penalize creators and channels for fake engagement, scammers are using stolen TikTok videos to gain social currency using content that doesn\u2019t belong to them.\u201dPassword Reset:\u00a0On-Demand Event: Fortify 2022 with a password-security strategy built for today\u2019s threats.

        "raw text": "While researching a recent large-scale bot campaign with CQ Prime Threat Research team lead, Dean Lendrum, we found attackers using domain parking and monetization services to register multiple domains, creating a large number of fake eCommerce accounts per domain.TL; DRAnalysis of shopping-bot campaign data uncovered more than 850,000 fake accounts associated with a relatively small number of domains.Clusters and common patterns point to domain-name registration and hosting services (like Namecheap); with parking, monetization and email forwarding being used to execute large-scale shopping bot campaigns.Retailers should analyze historic data to uncover patterns emanating from suspicious domains using the same hosting infrastructure. Patterns observed include irregular domain names, domain resolving to an untrusted web app, SSL not enabled.Send email account-creation verification or consider the use of multifactor authentication (MFA) when possible.DetailsLike it or not, malicious bot managers are business people and they are always looking for ways to reduce the cost of their eCommerce bot campaigns. Using domain parking and monetization services (e.g., Namecheap, ParkingCrew, etc.) is one way they can inexpensively create many fake accounts that they can then use in their large-scale bot campaigns. Fake accounts associated with the registered domains come complete with email-forwarding enabled. When used in the bot campaign, the emails will appear valid to the retailer, but behind the scenes, the forwarding service will just drop the mails.To demonstrate how easy this is to do, we were able to establish an account for $1.18 in less than five minutes using Namecheap, one of several domain parking solutions available. Getting started was as easy as depositing funds into a Namecheap account and using its API to call namecheap.domains.create. We now had a domain and an associated account with free VPN and business email for two months; free email forwarding forever; and SSL as an option at $10 per year.Shortly thereafter we were able to begin monetizing the new domain via the Namecheap-ParkingCrew partnership; a common practice for threat actors, evidenced by bot forums boasting of the money being made via rogue traffic hitting their parked domains.Attack Characteristics ObservedWhen investigating any of the domains on their own, everything appears to be normal. But, when grouping the bad-acting domains by their companion web server A records and mail-redirect server MX records, clusters of behavior begin to form.863,874 fake accounts were mapped to 1,810 domains, generating heavy bot traffic.Of those 1,810 domains, 440 were mapped to Namecheap and ParkingCrew, and only 255 of them had SSL enabled.The lack of SSL is a clear sign that the domain is suspicious, given that nearly all legitimate domains will have it enabled. The only reason we can think of for the lack of SSL is the cost \u2013 it\u2019s an added $10 per year, going back to the position that the bot operators are looking to reduce costs.When analyzing suspected fraudulent user accounts and associated orders, retail security teams should investigate the email domain the web and email traffic are resolving to legitimate domains using tools like mxlookup and dig. If mail exchange servers are common between many different domains as shown in image 1, check the domain name and see if this resolves to a valid web application. Similarly, analyze whether many domains are pointing to a single web server A record and check the web application hosted, taking note of content, purpose and security features like SSL.Implications of Mass Shopping Bot CampaignsJust as bots-as-a-service have made botting available to the masses, the use of domain registration and monetization services is another example of the commercialization of the botting industry. In this example, threat actors are able to easily create many thousands of fake accounts for use in their large-scale bot campaigns which in turn, impacts the entire business. Security and fraud teams are overwhelmed trying to separate legitimate from malicious. In some cases, infrastructure costs will spike due to the increased volume, while sales and marketing metrics are skewed wildly by the illegitimate traffic.Jason Kent is Hacker-in-Residence at Cequence Security.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s\u00a0Infosec\u00a0Insiders\u00a0community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.InfoSec InsiderWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Riot Games, the developer behind League of Legends, has filed a California lawsuit against scammers, whose identities aren\u2019t yet known, for ripping off job seekers with the promise of a gig with the company.Usually early in their careers and eager for a chance with a gaming company like Riot, job hunters are either targeted by a cybercriminal posing as a recruiter or with fake ads on popular employment sites like Indeed, Riot\u2019s filing explained.This email submitted as part of Riot\u2019s lawsuit includes a fake listing for a video game artist/illustrator.Source:Then, the applicant is run through an imaginary interview process with questions that seem legit, like, \u201cWhy do you want to work at Riot Games?\u201d and, \u201cHonestly describe what kind of working conditions you thrive in.\u201dThe interview would often be conducted by chat and followed by a quick job offer.To make things extra convincing, the fraudsters used contacts and other communications doctored-up with Riot branding, including convincing looking employment contracts.After the interview, there\u2019s just one step left for the interviewee \u2014 they are asked to send money for \u201cwork equipment\u201d like an iPad, which the interviewer assures the new hire will be refunded. Spoiler: they aren\u2019t going to be.Source: Polygon.Riot included copies of checks sent to the fraudsters by victims in its complaint, ranging from $2,400 to $4,300.Riot wasn\u2019t the only prominent gaming company used to lure in victims, Polygon reportedly heard from people approached by fake representatives of Rockstar Games and Manticore Games, according to its report.\u201c[The scam] is absolutely appalling,\u201d Riot\u2019s lawyers wrote in the complaint. \u201cTheir victims largely are young, na\u00efve, and want nothing more than to work for Riot, one of the most prestigious video-game companies in the world. Defendants prey on the hopes and dreams of these individuals in order to steal their identities and pillage their bank accounts.\u201dRiot Games representatives said in an interview with Polygon that the company isn\u2019t exactly sure how many people have already been victimized by the phishing campaign.Gamers and \u2018Dynamite Phishing\u2019 \u00a0Phishing lure themes are fickle, and ebb and flow with the latest headlines. COVID-19, Chipotle offers, easy infrastructure legislation money, and now, dream gaming jobs, are all bait intended to illicit an emotional reaction and make otherwise rational people take action without thinking it through.Last summer, the Threat Intelligence Team at GreatHorn discovered a rise in business email compromise (BEC) attacks that sent X-rated material to people at work to try and trigger an emotional response, something the report called \u201cdynamite phishing.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t always involve explicit material, but the goal is to put the user off balance, frightened \u2013 any excited emotional state \u2013 to decrease the brain\u2019s ability to make rational decisions,\u201d according to the report.A fantasy job at a huge gaming company could certainly trigger a highly emotional response in the right person.This fake gaming company job scam leverages both the co-called Great Resignation of 2021, which saw record-breaking numbers of workers looking for better gigs, as well as the pandemic push to work-from-home. Now a call from a personal cell phone number, or a Zoom interview in someone\u2019s kitchen, doesn\u2019t seem all that unusual and fraudsters are taking advantage.Gaming itself is under relentless attack. Last summer, Akamai Technologies found attacks on gaming web applications alone jumped by a staggering 340 percent in 2020.From Grinchbots scooping up vast swaths of the latest hardware inventory to last month\u2019s back-to-back PlayStation 5 breaches and malicious gaming apps lurking in marketplaces, this latest fake job fraud is just another way criminals are trying to exploit the enthusiasm of gamers.Now Riot hopes to use this lawsuit as a way to track down the cybercriminals and make it clear the company was not behind the scam, according to Riot attorney Dan Nabel.\u201cWe\u2019re upset that people who viewed Riot as their dream company, even if that\u2019s one person, had been defrauded through this scam,\u201d Nabel told Polygon. \u201cSecondarily, we felt a need to protect our employees who are having their identities impersonated.\u201dThere\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.\u00a0REGISTER TODAY\u00a0to learn key concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and how to use it to navigate the data ocean and add context to cybersecurity threats (without being an expert!).

        "raw text": "Threat actors are using malicious Android apps to scam users into signing up for a bogus premium SMS subscription service, which results in big charges accruing on their phone bills.Jakub Vavra from the threat operations team of security firm Avast uncovered the campaign, which he dubbed UltimaSMS because one of the first apps he discovered being used to scam people was called Ultima Keyboard Pro, he said in a blog post published Monday.\u201cThe fake apps I found feature a wide range of categories such as custom keyboards, QR code scanners, video and photo editors, spam call blockers, camera filters, and games, among others,\u201d Vavra wrote in the post.Essentially, the campaign \u2014 which appears to have started in May and is ongoing \u2014 is comprised of at least 151 apps that at one point or another have been available on the Google Play Store; collectively they\u2019ve been downloaded more than 10.5 million times.Google has since removed the flagged apps from the store, but there are likely others he said; indeed, Google Play persistently has been plagued by fake apps spreading malware.All of the offerings are \u201cessentially copies of the same fake app used to spread the premium SMS scam campaign,\u201d Vavra explained, which he said likely indicates that one bad actor or group is behind the entire campaign.While the apps are advertised with profiles that seem legitimate, closer inspection points to something more suspicious, Vavra observed. For instance, they tend to include generic privacy policy statements and feature basic developer profiles including generic email addresses, as well as numerous negative reviews that identify them as fraudulent.Citing insights from mobile marketing intelligence firm Sensor Tower, he said the campaign appears to be global, ensnaring users from more than 80 countries.\u201cThe apps have been most downloaded by users in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, followed by users in the U.S. and Poland,\u201d Vavra explained.How It WorksThe threat actor behind the campaign is spreading UltimaSMS with \u201cnumerous catchy video advertisements\u201d posted on advertising channels of social-media sites like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, Vavra explained.If an Android user takes the bait and installs one of the apps, it checks their location, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), and phone number to determine which country area code and language to use for the scam, according to the post.\u201cOnce the user opens the app, a screen, localized in the language their device is set to, prompts them to enter their phone number, and in some cases email address, to gain access to the app\u2019s advertised purpose,\u201d Vavra wrote.Once the user enters the details, the app subscribes him or her to a premium SMS service which sends texts to a short-coded number \u2014 each text results in a charge for the user. These charges can total upwards of $40 per month depending on the country and mobile carrier.And, instead of unlocking the apps\u2019 advertised features, the apps will either display further SMS subscriptions options or stop working altogether, he explained.\u201cThe sole purpose of the fake apps is to deceive users into signing up for premium SMS subscriptions,\u201d Vavra wrote.Benefits of Reading the Fine PrintIn fact, some of the apps actually describe this intention to users in fine print; however, not all of them extend this courtesy, \u201cmeaning many people who submitted their phone numbers into the apps might not even realize the extra charges to their phone bill are connected to the apps,\u201d he explained.The apps collect premium SMS charges from subscribers typically to the maximum limit possible for their particular country, according to Avast. Sometimes carriers will alert users of the excessive charges, but they also may go unnoticed for weeks or months, Vavra wrote.How to Protect Yourself from Android ScamsTo avoid being defrauded by the UltimaSMS scam, users should follow the same common-sense vigilance and protocols for downloading and purchasing new apps: Check reviews first; read the fine print; don\u2019t enter a phone number unless you trust the app; and only use official app stores.People also can disable premium SMS with their wireless carrier so threat actors can\u2019t abuse the service; this is something that is especially important to do with devices that parents give to children, as they are more likely to fall prey to scams using colorful and catchy ads, Vavra wrote.Indeed, \u201cbased on some of the user accounts that left negative reviews, it looks like children are among the victims\u201d of UltimaSMS, \u00a0making this step especially important, he observed.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\u00a0\u00a0MalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "More than 3,300 U.S. military service members, military dependents and civilians employed by the Department of Defense were compromised as part of a transnational cybercrime ring created to defraud them out of $1.5 million in military benefits from the DoD and the Department of Veterans Affairs.A former civilian medical records technician and administrator with the U.S. Army was at the center of the scheme, according to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Fredrick Brown, a Las Vegas resident, was sentenced to 12 and a half years in prison last week, after admitting that between July 2014 and September 2015, he stole personally identifiable information (PII) for thousands of people.In his capacity as a records technician, Brown had access to a military electronic health records database. He admitted that he took screenshots to pilfer names, Social-Security numbers, military ID numbers, dates of birth and contact information from the victims.He sent the information to a Philippines-based co-defendant, Robert Wayne Boling Jr., he said. Boling and associates then used the data to access DoD and benefits sites and steal millions of dollars, according to the court documents.As part of its nefarious work, the ring particularly targeted disabled veterans, who were selected because they were eligible for more service-related benefits, court officials said.\u201cThe defendant brazenly preyed on and victimized U.S. servicemembers and veterans, many of whom were disabled and elderly,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Ashley C. Hoff for the Western District of Texas, in a media statement. \u201cAs part of our mission, we strive to protect these honorable men and women from fraud and abuse. If fraudsters target our servicemembers and veterans, we will seek to identify them and hold them accountable. This office will continue to zealously investigate and prosecute perpetrators of these schemes.\u201dIn addition to 151 months of prison time, Chief Judge Orlando Garcia ordered Brown to pay $2.3 million in restitution. He\u2019ll also be placed on supervised release for three years after he gets out.\u201cRather than honoring those servicemembers and veterans who sacrifice for them, the defendant and his co-conspirators targeted and stole from these brave men and women in a years-long fraud scheme,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division. \u201cSuch conduct is an affront to the United States and will not be tolerated.\u201dThe efforts to bring the ring\u2019s participants to justice are ongoing: In July 2020, Garcia sentenced Brown co-defendant and accomplice Trorice Crawford to 46 months in federal prison, a fine of $103,700 and a three-year supervised release post-jail. Brown worked with Crawford to recruit money mules \u2014 individuals who would deposit the stolen funds into their bank accounts and then send the funds through international wire remittance services to the fraudsters in a money-laundering operation, according to the court..U.S. service members have been victims of PII exposure in the past. In May for example, a database filled with the medical records of nearly 200,000 U.S. military veterans was exposed online by a vendor working for the VA, and an analyst found that it might have been\u00a0exfiltrated by ransomware attackers.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.BreachGovernmentPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A sophisticated fraud ring, dubbed Proxy Phantom, has pushed the boundaries of credential-stuffing attacks with a dynamic account takeover (ATO) technique that was flooding eCommerce merchants in the third quarter.Researchers at Sift uncovered the group, which is innovating in the realm of large-scale, automated ATO attacks, they said. Specifically, Proxy Phantom specializes in using a massive cluster of connected, rotating IP addresses to automatically try more than 1.5 million stolen username and password combinations against various log-in screens. The third-quarter attacks affected dozens of online merchants, but the next targets could be in any number of sectors.\u201cThe group flooded businesses with bot-based login attempts to conduct as many as 2,691 log-in attempts per second\u2014all coming from seemingly different locations,\u201d the researchers explained in a Thursday analysis. \u201cAs a result, targeted merchants \u2026 would be forced to play a supercharged, global game of whack-a-mole, with new combinations of IP addresses and credentials coming for them at an unthinkable pace.\u201dThe username/password combos were likely purchased in bulk on the Dark Web, the report noted. Ongoing credential theft and the collation of multiple breaches into vast collections has made underground forums home to a wonderland of login offerings, fueling an ongoing ATO boom. But what really set the Proxy Phantom attacks apart was the use of dynamically generated IP addresses from which it launched the campaigns.Researchers observed several large IP clusters (networks of connected IPs) blossoming across the web, with one of them ballooning 50-fold within the space of one quarter. Many of these were \u201coriginating from a known, high-risk ISP, and indicating a fraud ring in action,\u201d they noted.\u201cWhile it\u2019s inevitable that will grow over time, this specific one exploded in size,\u201d according to Sift. \u201cIn analyzing its traffic, our data scientists discovered that the cluster was centered around just a few proxy servers, and connected to scores of attempted, failed logins\u2014pointing to automation and proxy IP rotation within the same address space.\u201dThis is a remodel of typical ATO techniques that\u2019s aimed at making a greater impact, researchers noted. Simultaneously and rapidly switching IP addresses helps cyberattackers to hide the origin of the attacks, while also evading detection from typical rules-based fraud prevention systems.\u201cTypically, fraud rings use a handful of IP addresses or hosts and cycle through a large list of stolen user credentials to breach a merchant\u2019s security measures,\u201d according to the firm. \u201cBy leveraging automation for both credential and IP address rotation, this ring exhibited a major evolution of the classic blitz ATO attack.\u201dThe fraud-detection evasion is particularly concerning, the analysis pointed out, because the sheer volume of login attempts could end up fogging security systems altogether.\u201cThese types of next-gen attacks could crush a merchant\u2026leaving them stuck trying to block one IP address after another and trying to catch up to a machine that rotates data faster than any human or static rules could,\u201d according to the firm. \u201cWorse, it could overwhelm those rules \u2014 as more IPs show up and fail at breakneck speed, rules designed to assess risk will begin to identify everything as suspicious, deeply undermining the accuracy of the system.\u201dATO Attacks See Staggering UptickSift also released its Q3 2021 Digital Trust & Safety Index on Thursday, which shows that ATO attacks have tripled (up 307 percent) just since April 2019.This attack method made up 39 percent of all fraud blocked on Sift\u2019s network in Q2 2021 alone, the company noted.\u201cFraudsters will never stop adapting their techniques to overwhelm traditional fraud prevention, making suspicious logins look legitimate, and legitimate ones look suspicious,\u201d said Jane Lee, trust and safety architect at Sift, in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, poor consumer security habits\u2014like reusing passwords for multiple accounts\u2014make it easy and continue to breathe life into the fraud economy.\u201dThe fintech and financial services sector in particular is under attack, the report found. ATO attacks in this vertical skyrocketed a staggering 850 percent between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021, \u201cmainly driven by a concentration on crypto exchanges and digital wallets, where fraudsters would likely try to liquidate accounts or make illicit purchases,\u201d Sift found.Additionally, nearly half (49 percent) of consumers surveyed as part of the report feel most at risk of ATO on financial services sites compared with other industries, with a full quarter of ATO victims noting their compromises came via financial services sites.The report also found that victims of ATO fraud are usually in for a long haul of misery. For instance, almost half (48 percent) of ATO victims have had their accounts compromised between two and five times.In each attack, 45 percent had money stolen from them directly, while 42 percent had a stored payment type used to make unauthorized purchases. More than one in four (26 percent) lost loyalty credits and rewards points to fraudsters.Nearly one in five (19 percent) of victims are unsure of the consequences of their accounts being compromised \u2013 perhaps because cybercriminals used the accounts for testing.\u201cMore often than not, nothing happens to corrupted accounts immediately after they\u2019ve been hacked \u2013 no unauthorized purchases, no stolen loyalty points, and no attempts to update passwords,\u201d according to the report. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because they\u2019re being used for something even more valuable.\u201dTo wit: active accounts offer the most prolonged cover for fraudsters to perform card testing, as well as test the user\u2019s credentials across their other high-value accounts, which may use the same information.\u201cFraudsters can use this veiled position to verify associated addresses and other personal customer data, correlate security codes and password hints, discover other cards on file to target and reveal connected accounts or apps \u2013 all without making a purchase or otherwise tipping their hand,\u201d Sift noted.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Most Recent ThreatListsWeb Security",

        "raw text": "This is Part II of a two-part blog series taking readers inside the criminal enterprise that is account-takeover fraud. For part I, please click here.\u00a0In my last blog, we focused on the initial phases of the account-takeover (ATO) kill chain \u2013 recon, weaponization and delivery \u2013 and how attackers leverage various tools and techniques to obfuscate bot activity as they acquire and test credentials via automation. After weaponization, threat actors will either decide to sell validated combo-lists for another criminal gang to leverage, or they will continue down the ATO kill chain, moving into the exploitation and action phases.In these last two stages, attackers put the bots aside, roll up their sleeves and take a manual (human) approach to try and compromise individual accounts. The purpose? Well, that depends on what type of account they have compromised. For accounts that have digital wallets, they will be performing the process of money-muling, which involves extracting that money from the digital account and transferring it to themselves in some untraceable way.For accounts that have loyalty points or digital assets of some kind, the process is similar: get the value from the account you\u2019ve taken over and monetize it for yourself. Europol reports that 90 percent of the money-muling they see is attributed to cybercrime.So what typically happens next, before the money-muling begins? Criminals take the validated combo-lists and start logging in to the targeted accounts. In some cases, they\u2019ll get access to the account because, after all, the credential-stuffing effort already demonstrated that the credentials were valid. However, traditional indicators of compromise (IOCs) might trigger the manual fraud alarm bells, like recent changes to shipping and/or email addresses.Or, perhaps the fraud team notices that multiple accounts across the targeted organization suddenly all have the same shipping address. In these cases, bad actors get challenged with secondary/step-up authentication requests from the website. It could be a security question, a code sent to the mobile phone listed in the account profile, or other challenge.PayPal: An Example of the Exploitation and Action PhaseLet\u2019s imagine that the attacker tries to access a PayPal account with the legitimate owner\u2019s username and password. But because something about the login is different, PayPal decides to direct the attacker to a screen requesting a one-time password validation. These challenges may be enough to ward off many account-takeover attempts. However, if the target account is high profile or lucrative enough, the attacker may go the extra mile to circumvent the organization\u2019s fraud controls and challenges.And while the attacker didn\u2019t necessarily gain access to the account this time, knowing which authentication controls that an organization has in place is invaluable information to the criminal who can now adjust tactics and techniques.Continuing with the PayPal example, let\u2019s say PayPal sends a response that a one-time password will be texted to the account owner\u2019s phone number on record, with the screen displaying the last four digits of that number. By way of a quick Google search, the attacker can now easily uncover the full phone number of the individual and determine the associated cell phone carrier.Now, with various legitimate pieces of personal information on the potential victim on hand, the criminal could attempt to social-engineer the carrier\u2019s customer service agent to conduct a SIM swap and have another cell phone activated with the number tied to the targeted individual\u2019s PayPal account. Motivated by large upsides, attackers will put skin in the money-muling game to maximize their chances of handsome ATO payouts.Issues with Asymmetric DetectionTo increase the fidelity of stopping manual fraudsters, we are seeing some security technologies deploy asymmetric detection capabilities to stop would-be ATO attackers at the moment of login. While the threat actor may still be using accurate usernames and passwords, account protection technology looks for particular signals and assesses associated risk profiles in real time to determine whether to authenticate the user \u2013 all without alerting the attacker they have triggered this score and represent an anomaly.This account-protection technology builds a dynamic profile of the valid user based on characteristics that can\u2019t easily be guessed or mimicked by the attacker. For example, user and population profiling captures various information about the device that can be compared to a database of valid fingerprints. If the attacker claims to be coming from an iOS device with software version 14.2 but sends headers of an older web browser, this could be a trigger to suspect something is wrong.But \u2014 attackers have been getting better at emulating these devices without error so we need to be looking at something the attackers can not easily emulate.Monitoring for Real Human BehaviorOne idea is to create a database of what \u201creal users\u201d or more importantly \u201cvalid account owners\u201d look like when they connect. For instance, what device they last came from when they successfully logged in, or what ISP they\u2019re using when they commonly connect from home. These kinds of signals are more specific to the actual account owners that would be much more difficult for the attacker to try and emulate on their own.As an example, if the legitimate account owner logged in from a Texas IP address 15 minutes ago, it would be improbable that the same legitimate user logged in an hour later from a residential IP block in Maine. (This might trigger the \u201cimprobable travel\u201d risk score.) The conflicting physical IP addresses associated with the login attempt would trigger an appropriate response based on a real-time risk score.Of course, they could also be employing a VPN so many different signals like this need to be evaluated at the time of login.Even so, by creating a risk-based view of how similar the current login request looks to what the known good user looked like the last few times they\u2019ve logged in provides additional insights into the questions \u201cIs this really Tony Lauro logging in, or someone else using his credentials?\u201dBy evaluating these known traits sampled from the real Tony Lauro, it allows more accurate options available if a fraudster is detected such as step-up authentication, one-time password (OTP) challenges, blocking or simply tag the request with its associated risk score to be passed onto the companies fraud team where they can have further fidelity into what their tools are doing to detect imposters and stop them before they take over customer accounts.And that\u2019s the good news in the fight against ATO risks. We don\u2019t have to accept that direct fraud will happen. Taking steps to stop the ATO attacks earlier in the kill chain can help both clients and consumers interact more safely online.This is Part II of a two-part blog series taking readers inside the criminal enterprise that is account-takeover fraud.

        "raw text": "A new analysis from the Washington Post reveals just how widespread fraud is across the Apple App Store, while also offering glimpse into the revenue flowing into Cupertino generated by those malicious activities.The Apple App Store has been under heightened scrutiny for maintaining its iron grip on the apps available to iOS users. CEO Tim Cook says the company\u2019s monopoly on app access is necessary to maintain certain standards for safety and effectiveness.But the data from The Post suggests otherwise, showing that out of all of the the top-1,000 grossing apps, almost 2 percent are scams. Notably, these apps have billed Apple customers $48 million while they\u2019ve been available in the store, and Apple gets a 30 percent cut of every transaction. Once alerted to 18 fraud apps in the Store found by The Post, two-thirds were taken down, according to the report.Threatpost has not yet received a response from Apple regarding the report.The Post gathered up the top-1,000 grossing apps for the day reported by Apple in order to conduct the analysis, drawing a dramatic contrast between the company\u2019s public statements and its own data. It found an array of scam apps covering everything from fake VPN service to fraud dating apps and more. Fleecewear apps (which charge exorbitant subscription fees after a free trial period) and fake reviews to drive up the ratings of fraudulent apps were also prevalent, according to the report.\u201cWe hold developers to high standards to keep the App Store a safe and trusted place for customers to download software, and we will always take action against apps that pose a harm to users,\u201d Fred Sainz, a spokesperson for Apple, said in a media statement. \u201cApple leads the industry with practices that put the safety of our customers first, and we\u2019ll continue learning, evolving our practices and investing the necessary resources to make sure customers are presented with the very best experience.\u201dBut economist Stan Miles argued in The Post that customers are being given a false sense that they are in a secure environment, when, in fact, they aren\u2019t. Miles added the lack of competition is the reason Apple isn\u2019t being forced to take security as seriously as it needs to.Interestingly, even though Google doesn\u2019t rely on a security argument to control app access \u2014 although it screen apps before they are published \u2014 The Post\u2019s analysis found 134 fleecewear apps on the App Sore and just 70 on the Play Store, earning $365 million and $38.5, respectively, lending credence to the idea that a false sense of security really is worse than nothing at all.Epic Apple Emails Annoyed by having to give up 30 percent of their revenue to the App Store, Epic Games, the publisher of blockbuster game Fortnite, recently hauled Apple to California court arguing that its store is a monopoly the courts should break up. Besides getting Apple\u2019s top leadership on the record about their business, the trial also unearthed a trove of emails showing internal company struggles, dating back years, over a lack of App Store security.For instance, Eric Friedman, head of Apple\u2019s Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk unit (FEAR) wrote in a 2016 email that Apple\u2019s screening process for apps is, \u201cmore like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug-sniffing dog,\u201d The Post reported.Even Apple\u2019s head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, ultimately testified in court last week that the level of malware on the Mac platform is \u201cunacceptable.\u201dApple\u2019s App Store PR and Data Differ On April 21, Apple\u2019s chief compliance officer testified in front of Congress about the number of scam apps in the App Store. \u201cUnfortunately, no one is perfect,\u201d Kyle Andeer said. \u201cBut I think what we\u2019ve shown, over and over again, is that we do a better job than others. I think one of the real risks of opening up the iPhone to side loading or third-party app stores is that this problem will only multiply,\u201d drawing a dramatic contrast between the company\u2019s public statements and its own data.Apple has dealt with a series of security woes lately. The company\u2019s Find My Device function was recently found to be vulnerable to data theft. And in March, Apple rushed out a fix for a memory-corruption bug. The same month, cybercriminals were targeting Apple developers with a trojanized Xcode project to install a backdoor for spying and data exfiltration.Epic Games also sued Google Play to get around paying the 30 percent fees to the platforms. The Apple case is with the judge and both parties are awaiting a ruling.\u201cUnfortunately, just by association, malevolent application developers on the AppStore have extended Apple\u2019s circle of trust to apply to their apps quite easily,\u201d Setu Kulkarni with WhiteHat Security told Threatpost. \u201cConsequently, when an app is on the AppStore, the silent majority of everyday users just click and install without ever worrying about the provenance of the application. And why not? They\u2019ve chosen to pay the high price of entry into the Apple ecosystem which touts privacy and security as some of its key benefits and differentiators.\u201dConsidering Apple\u2019s size, reputation and resources the company certainly could be doing more to protect its customers from malicious apps, he added.\u201cWhile security professionals will continue to raise and spread awareness around digital safety, it is really Apple who has the proverbial megaphone to raise awareness amongst its customer base and also to ultimately ensure that the App Store does not become a vehicle for perpetrating fraud and scams,\u201d Kulkarni said.Join Threatpost for \u201cA Walk On The Dark Side: A Pipeline Cyber Crisis Simulation\u201d\u2013 a LIVE interactive demo on\u00a0Wed, June 9 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "The past 18 months have arguably been the most turbulent on record for the mobile industry. The majority of the world spent significant portions of 2020 under some kind of lockdown, with pressure mounting on mobile operators to keep us connected to the outside world, and with each other. This pressure was felt most acutely in emerging markets such as South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia where users depend almost exclusively on their mobile phones to interact with the online world. Perhaps that\u2019s why, according to a new report published by Upstream, they seem to be the epicenter of a new mobile malware pandemic.Mobile ad fraud has always been a challenge for network operators in all parts of the globe, but the pandemic has made users more vulnerable than ever before due to the sheer amount of time they now spend with their devices. This vulnerability is only heightened in countries where mobile phones are the primary vehicle for accessing educational resources, government services, news broadcasts, entertainment and shopping. For many of these markets data credit is like currency, something that can be taken literally for \u201cunbanked\u201d users who use their data to buy goods and services through direct carrier billing.Bad actors are all too aware of this, and we\u2019ve seen a surge in malware activity and sophistication as a result. Secure-D, Upstream\u2019s full-stack anti-fraud platform, currently works with 35 operators in 23 emerging markets to block and identify fraudulent apps and keep users safe. As part of its ongoing efforts to curb malware and raise awareness of new and evolving threats, Secure-D released an in-depth 2021 report called A Pandemic On Mobile: Mobile Ad Fraud & Malware which revealed some vital and surprising insights. The report drills down into how ad fraud and malware have advanced in the wake of the pandemic, often disproportionately targeting developing regions.The data in the report is based on 840 million mobile subscribers worldwide. One of the most staggering findings was that 95% of all mobile transactions during the pandemic were identified and subsequently blocked as fraudulent. These transactions originate from fraudulent apps posing as legitimate ones, often purchasing premium subscriptions or other content in the background without the user\u2019s direct knowledge or consent. Naturally, this would result in a very high volume of complaints and refund requests to the operator were the transactions not identified and blocked at source. According to the report, which is now freely available, more than 45,000 malicious apps were in circulation in these emerging markets throughout the pandemic, many of them employing new sophisticated tactics to get onto people\u2019s handsets and trigger fraudulent transactions. For the first time ever, mobile games were the number one most targeted app category, but malicious apps took on the form of many other productivity apps and tools, from video editors to fake news apps.The most suspicious app of the entire pandemic was \u201ccom.android.fmradio\u201d, a radio player app that was single-handedly responsible for 99.8 million fraudulent transactions, all of which were caught and blocked by Secure-D. The app was downloaded by 356,270 devices worldwide but is thankfully no longer available on the Google Play store.To gain more insight like this, such as a breakdown of the most dangerous apps by region, which countries were most impacted by fraud during the pandemic, and how direct carrier billing fraud works, you can get a copy of the report mailed directly to your inbox here.SponsoredWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Though it\u2019s often hard to find group consensus, one thing everyone can agree on is a feeling of relief that we may be moving past the worst of the pandemic. While few want to look back on the darkest times, those months have continuing lessons to teach about cybersecurity. Like it or not, the echoes of 2020 continue to reverberate into 2021 in both the physical and digital worlds, and we ignore that fact to our peril.Yes, the first year of the pandemic has passed, but it graciously left behind many of its cyber-fraud problems, which will continue for the foreseeable future as threat research shows. Malicious actors will continue to focus on maximizing their profits, using the traditional cost-benefit analysis to decide on the best attack vector. Remote work will continue as companies embrace the workplace changes wrought by COVID-19. From the cybercriminal perspective, these trends only increase the return on investment for their scams and fraud. With this in mind, organizations must remain vigilant to protect themselves and their sensitive data from these attack methodologies.Post-Vax Social-Engineering Attacks Won\u2019t SubsideCybercriminals see in social-engineering attacks an effective, high-impact, low-cost methodology. Just as with legitimate businesses, cybercriminals want to maximize profit while reducing operational costs. And thanks to an abundance of \u201cas-a-service\u201d criminal software available via the Dark Web, social-engineering attacks are perfectly positioned to meet these goals.What makes social-engineering attacks so successful is that they target people\u2019s emotions, manipulating the fight-or-flight response. When people become overwhelmed by feelings like fear or empathy, they often make rash decisions. When the pandemic began, cybercriminals used these emotions to launch successful phishing attacks. Typical themes included layoffs and impersonating health authorities. Later, we saw more attempts focused on the vaccine.People were initially desperate for information, so they let down their digital guards \u2013 leading to increased profitability. As countries start to offer more vaccination opportunities, those same emotions will continue to make social-engineering scams profitable. With such a desire to return to a \u201cnormal\u201d life, people want to believe that positive information related to the pandemic is real. This desire makes social-engineering attacks about vaccines more profitable. Only when this information becomes more concrete and publicly available will threat actors see the viability of these scams lessen from a cost-benefit perspective.As the world begins to open up and we crawl toward a brighter future, people are going to be looking for things to do and places to go \u2013 so we also expect to see social-engineering attacks start using things like travel and vacation deals to hook people.The Home Office Continues to Be a Major TargetThe distinction between home and office blurred significantly last year, meaning that targeting the home puts adversaries one step closer to the corporate network. In the second half of 2020, exploits targeting internet-of-things (IoT) devices topped the list. Every IoT device introduces a new network \u201cedge\u201d that must be defended and requires security monitoring and enforcement. With many companies continuing to allow at least some of their employees to work remotely with no stipulated end date, security leaders have to stay abreast of the latest threats regarding edge access and browsers.The good news for cybercriminals, and bad news for everyone else, is that malware\u00a0code is more flexible and able to reach further into the attack surface. One malware campaign can have a wide focus across different devices and platforms. For example, Adrozek is a malware family that has been successful across multiple browsers and applications, and it has a large infrastructure. This family is controlling hundreds of thousands of domains. The malware itself does browser injection to seed malicious search results once that browser is infected. Once you load a malicious DLL extension, it\u2019s essentially game over. People don\u2019t realize that a lot of edge devices also have browsers.Browsers are needed for a device to receive communication and updates even if you\u2019re not opening up an application and putting in a website\u2019s address. Bad actors are taking advantage of devices\u2019 built-in browser code. People have gotten used to assuming that browsers are secure; much of the time, they get updated automatically. But browsers are essentially the new edge in many instances.Attacks don\u2019t necessarily have to find vulnerabilities in the browser but just in the backend \u2013 how the browser delivers an ad, how it processes things like searches or any other process that gives attackers an opportunity. Botnets allow attackers to create hundreds of thousands of drones that can attack a wide variety of machines, including Windows systems, Mac systems, Linux, edge devices,\u00a0IoT\u00a0devices and more.How to Defeat Disruptive AttacksSocial-engineering attacks and threats related to edge access/browsers/IoT together represent the major ways in which cyberattackers are targeting individuals, as a way of getting into larger organizations.Fighting cybercrime requires an integrated strategy and broad awareness.Threat intelligence will remain central to understanding these threats and how to defend against them. Visibility is also crucial, especially when a large percentage of users are outside the standard network perimeter. Every device creates a new network edge that the security team must secure and monitor. Using artificial intelligence and automated threat detection can help organizations address attacks immediately, not at some later point, and are needed to mitigate attacks at speed and scale across all edges. Organizations should also prioritize cybersecurity awareness training, because cyber hygiene is not just the domain of IT and security teams. These best practices will help you learn from 2020\u2019s cyber lessons and help protect individual employees and the organization as a whole.Aamir Lakhani is a cybersecurity researcher and practitioner at FortiGuard Labs.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.Cloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderIoTMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A money-laundering fraud ring is targeting donation sites, taking advantage of the outpouring of charity sparked by the global pandemic.Dubbed Cart Crasher by the Sift security firm, the fraud ring leverages guest checkout options on donation sites to steal money and launder stolen payment cards.The scheme is straightforward: First, fraudsters set up recipient accounts on various donation sites. Then, they create and post fake causes for which to receive donations.From there, the crooks use stolen credit cards, and fake usernames and emails, to \u201cdonate\u201d thousands of dollars to their own fabricated causes (via automated scripts). The donations are made in denominations of $5 or less. And, using the option to check out as a guest in order to skip the need to create accounts makes the activity much harder to trace.\u201cUsing stolen credit cards, fake accounts, and automated scripts to do the dirty work, this fraud ring repeatedly funneled small amounts of money to themselves by setting up fake causes on various giving sites in order to request donations,\u201d according to Sift\u2019s annual report on evolving fraud tactics, released Wednesday.The Cart Crasher campaign. Source: Sift.According to Sift, Cart Crasher achieves a dual purpose with its strategy: The fraudsters can not only test stolen payment information to see if it\u2019s valid, but it also allows them to steal and then clean funds from the stolen accounts.And, the time is right for such an approach, given that charitable giving is surging.\u201cIn 2020, the pandemic drove online giving up by 21 percent, providing cover to fraudsters who hide behind traffic and transaction surges, knowing that many merchants won\u2019t be equipped to handle scaling demand and rising fraud simultaneously,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWith automation to execute these illicit transactions at inhuman speed, it\u2019s a scheme with the potential to cheat merchants and consumers out of thousands of dollars\u2014and allow fraudsters to use those ill-gotten gains to buy more stolen data on the Dark Web.\u201dEvolving Fraud TacticsSift also found that cybercriminals in general have evolved their payment-fraud tactics over the course of the last year. Based on data from more than 34,000 apps and websites, researchers found a 69 percent increase in average attempted fraud value since last year, across multiple verticals. The firm said that this is a clear sign of automation at work: Bots, scripts and malware taking advantage of easier-to-use checkout experiences and password reuse to do more damage in less time.\u201cThe combination of tech and new tactics is causing the most concern\u2026fraudsters are weaving them together to supercharge new, sophisticated patterns of attack,\u201d according to Sift. \u201cFraudsters are as knowledgeable about the mechanics of digital commerce as the legitimate merchants they target. They can accurately identify security vulnerabilities, and know how to use a merchant\u2019s success against them. As internet traffic surged last year by between 50 to 70 percent, the amount of money spent by online shoppers nearly doubled. Fraudsters seized on climbing transaction volumes and unanticipated consumer behaviors like stockpiling.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)\u00a0Web Security",

        "raw text": "Click to RegisterU.S. law enforcement arrested six \u201cringleaders\u201d of a Ghana-based cybercriminal enterprise, who had allegedly launched a slew of money-stealing scams dating back to 2013 that included romance scams, business email compromise attacks and fraud. Seized in the arrests were a slew of luxury vehicles including two 2019 Rolls Royce Cullinans, a 2020 Bentley Continental GT and a 2020 Mercedes-Benz G63 AMG.Authorities estimate the alleged group of criminals made over $55 million during its crime spree robbing mostly elderly online daters, small businesses and more.\u201cThe fraud schemes alleged that these defendants facilitated were lucrative, diverse, and most of all, callous,\u201d said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in a Wednesday statement. \u201cAs alleged, they engaged in email spoofing, duping elderly online daters into wiring them money, and applying for government-funded Coronavirus relief funds earmarked for the benefit of small businesses affected by the pandemic.\u201dWhile the six arrested were allegedly involved with the criminal enterprise based in Ghana, they were located across the U.S. and targeted individuals and businesses in the U.S.Scams Relating to Romance, COVID-19 Relief The six allegedly carried out various types of fraud over the past seven years. This includes business email compromise (BEC), where they allegedly duped businesses into wiring funds into attacker-owned accounts. This was done by impersonating employees of a victim\u2019s company, or third-party companies that partnered or did business with the victim\u2019s company.The six also allegedly carried out romance scams targeting older men and women who lived alone.They allegedly sent messages via email, text messaging, or online dating websites and tricked vulnerable victims into believing they were in a romantic relationship with a fake identity. Then, after gaining a victim\u2019s trust, they would allegedly convince them to wire money to attacker-controlled bank accounts.For instance, in one incident\u00a0a 64-year-old victim was tricked into believing that he was in a relationship with a Ghanaian model. The victim subsequently wired $39,000 to an attacker-controlled account \u2013 believing that the purported \u201cmodel\u201d needed it to leave Ghana and to receive an inheritance.Finally the six allegedly launched fraud schemes related to the COVID-19 pandemic. They did so by submitting fraudulent loan applications through the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program, which is designed to provide relief to small businesses during the pandemic \u2014 and collecting the money.\u201cThe Enterprise submitted fraudulent EIDL applications in the names of actual companies to the SBA and when an EIDL loan was approved, the funds were ultimately deposited in bank accounts controlled by members of the Enterprise, including certain of the defendants,\u201d according to the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Wednesday.Cybercriminal Activity: Moving the Illegal MoneyThe six defendants, charged in connection with their roles in the fraud and money laundering conspiracy, are Fred Asante, 35, Lord Aning, 28, (both arrested in Virginia on Wednesday), Celvin Freeman, 47, and Faisal Ali, 34, (both arrested in New Jersey on Wednesday). The four were presented in court on Wednesday.\u00a0Also part of the group are Farous Appiedu, 35, (previously arrested in Queens, New York in October) and Sadick Edusei Kissi, 24 (previously arrested in Fargo, North Dakota on February 2020).The six allegedly received fraudulent proceeds from various victims in dozens of business bank accounts that they owned and controlled.\u00a0These business bank accounts \u2013 totaling at least 45 \u2013 were opened in the names of companies that the six allegedly pretending to be involved with \u2013 including companies relating to automobile sales, food imports and exports, and freight trucking and shipping. From 2013 to 2020, the bank accounts had deposits totaling over $55 million.After the stolen money entered these bank accounts, the six allegedly withdrew and transported those fraudulent proceeds to other members of the cybercriminal enterprise, abroad.\u201cThis trade-based money laundering scheme was designed to obscure the origin of the fraud proceeds as well as the identity of the ultimate beneficiaries of these schemes,\u201d according to the DoJ.A \u201cvast majority\u201d of the deposits consisted of large wire transfers or check deposits from various individuals and entities. This also included payments for vehicles, food products, and other goods sold by the defendants that were purchased using fraud proceeds, according to the DoJ.COVID-19 Fraud and Romance Scams ContinueEmail based attacks \u2013 such as romance scams or business email compromise \u2013 and fraud scams continue to plague enterprises and individuals.Below, Ronnie Tokazowski, senior threat researcher with Agari, talks to Threatpost about why these types of scams continue to work.At the same time, cybercriminals are following the money \u2013 and there is certainly money to be made in launching these types of attacks.In fact, last year, romance schemes accounted for a record $304 million raked into cybercriminals, according to new data \u2013 up about 50 percent from 2019.At the same time, in September researchers found that the average wire-transfer loss from BEC attacks is significantly on the rise: In the second quarter of 2020 the average was $80,183, up from $54,000 in the first quarter.As seen in this recent law enforcement crackdown, the increase in scams around current events \u2013 particularly around the pandemic \u2013 have continued to also earn cybercriminals money. Beyond Covid-19 relief funds, attackers have also tweaked their lures to cash in on vaccine rollouts and personal protective equipment (PPE) needs.Cases of identity theft in the U.S. also doubled in 2020, mainly due to cybercriminals taking advantage of people affected economically by COVID-19 who filed to receive government benefits.Threatpost WEBINAR: \u00a0Save your spot for\u00a0\u201c15 Cybersecurity Gaffes SMBs Make,\u201d a\u00a0\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Feb. 24 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Cybercriminals count on you making these mistakes, but our experts will help you lock down your small- to mid-sized business like it was a Fortune 100.\u00a0Register NOW\u00a0for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar on Wed., Feb. 24.GovernmentHacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers are detailing widespread security issues in point-of-sale (PoS) terminals \u2013 specifically, three terminal device families manufactured by vendors Verifone and Ingenico.Click to register.The issues, which have been disclosed to the vendors and since patched, open several popular PoS terminals used by retailers worldwide to a variety of cyberattacks. Affected devices include Verifone VX520, Verifone MX series, and the Ingenico Telium 2 series. These devices are widely used by retailers \u2013 for instance, more than 7 million VeriFone VX520 terminals have been sold.\u201cThrough use of default passwords, we were able to execute arbitrary code through binary vulnerabilities (e.g., stack overflows, and buffer overflows),\u201d said researchers with the Cyber R&D Lab team, in a new analysis of the flaws this week. \u201cThese PoS terminal weaknesses enable an attacker to send arbitrary packets, clone cards, clone terminals,and install persistent malware.\u201dPoS terminals are devices that read payment cards (such as credit or debit cards). Of note, the affected devices are PoS terminals \u2013 the device used to process the card \u2013 as opposed to PoS systems, which include the cashier\u2019s interaction with the terminal as well as the merchants\u2019 inventory and accounting records.Security IssuesResearchers disclosed two security issues in these PoS terminals. The primary issue is that they ship with default manufacturer passwords \u2013 which a Google search can easily reveal.\u201cThose credentials provide access to special \u2018service modes,\u2019 where hardware configuration and other functions are available,\u201d said researchers. \u201cOne manufacturer, Ingenico, even prevents you from changing those defaults.\u201dLooking closer at the special \u201cservice modes,\u201d researchers then found that they contain \u2018undeclared functions\u2019 after tearing down the terminals and extracting their firmware.\u201cIn Ingenico and Verifone terminals, these functions enable execution of arbitrary code through binary vulnerabilities (e.g., stack overflows, and buffer overflows),\u201d said researchers. \u201cFor over 20-years, these \u2018service super modes\u2019 have allowed undeclared access. Often, the functions are in deprecated or legacy code that\u2019s still deployed with new installs.\u201dAttackers could leverage these flaws to launch an array of attacks. For instance, the arbitrary code-execution issue could allow attackers to send and modify data transfers between the PoS terminal and its network. Attackers could also read the data, allowing them to copy people\u2019s credit card information and ultimately run fraudulent transactions.\u201cAttackers can forge and alter transactions,\u201d they said. \u201cThey can attack the acquiring bank via server-side vulnerabilities, for example in the Terminal Management System (TMS). This invalidates the inherent trust given between the PoS terminal and its processor.\u201dResearchers reached out to both Verifone and Ingenico, and patches for the problems have since been issued.Verifone was informed at the end of 2019, and researchers confirmed that vulnerabilities were fixed later in 2020. \u201cIn Nov 2020 PCI has released an urgent update of Verifone terminals across the globe,\u201d said researchers.Meanwhile, researchers said it took almost two years to reach Ingenico and receive a confirmation of that fix.\u201cUnfortunately, they didn\u2019t partner with us through the remediation process, but we\u2019re glad it\u2019s fixed now,\u201d they said.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows; Limor Kessem, Executive Security Advisor, IBM Security; and Israel Barak, CISO at Cybereason,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

        "raw text": "With the promise of a widely available COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon, Europol, the European Union\u2019s law-enforcement agency, has issued a warning about the rise of vaccine-related Dark Web activity.The agency joins a chorus of security professionals that have concerns about widespread attacks on the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.The warning comes after Europol discovered a Mexico-based operation pushing fake influenza vaccines on the cybercrime underground in October. It said it is likely that these same actors will see another opportunity with the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine.\u201cThe detection of a fake influenza vaccine confirms that criminals seize opportunities as soon as they present themselves,\u201d the Europol warning read. \u201cOwing to the pandemic, the demand for the influenza vaccine has been higher than usual and there risks being a shortage. Criminals have reacted quickly by producing counterfeit influenza vaccines. The same scenario is also likely to happen when COVID-19 vaccines do become available.\u201dIt\u2019s a golden opportunity for cybercriminals, who can use fake vaccine offers as bait.. Europol added that high demand for the vaccine and potential shortages will likely drive consumers online looking for alternatives, the warning added.\u201cSome dark web markets feature advertisements for fake COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d according to Europol. \u201cThe number of offers is limited at this stage but will likely increase once a legitimate vaccine becomes available. Criminals advertise their fake vaccines using the brands of genuine pharmaceutical companies that are already in the final stages of testing.\u201dCOVID-19 Vaccine Phishing Attempts The anticipation of a COVID-19 vaccine is precisely the kind of global event cybercriminals have learned to leverage into profits. There have been several other recent developments which clearly demonstrate that malicious actors will eagerly endanger public health if it means raising a quick buck, or Bitcoin.Already, researchers have reported a phishing campaign spread across six countries targeted organizations associated with The Vaccine Alliance\u2019s Cold Chain Equipment Optimizations Platform (CCEOP) program.The attackers sent phishing emails to impersonate an executive of Haier Biomedical, a company known to the recipients as a member and reportedly the sole end-to-end cold supply chain provider, which is needed to deliver the COVID-19 vaccine, IBM reported.\u201cThe targets included the European Commission\u2019s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, as well as organizations within the energy, manufacturing, website creation and software and internet security solutions sectors. These are global organizations headquartered in Germany, Italy, South Korea, Czech Republic, greater Europe and Taiwan,\u201d IBM\u2019s report said. \u201cSpear-phishing emails were sent to select executives in sales, procurement, information technology and finance positions, likely involved in company efforts to support a vaccine cold chain. We also identified instances where this activity extended organization-wide to include help and support pages of targeted organizations.\u201dOperation Warp Speed Warning As a result of the IBM X-Force findings, CISA issued guidance to Operation Warp Speed organizations to boost security related to COVID-19 vaccine storage and transport.\u201cImpersonating a biomedical company, cyber-actors are sending phishing and spearphishing emails to executives and global organizations involved in vaccine storage and transport to harvest account credentials,\u201d CISA\u2019s Dec. 3 statement said. \u201cThe emails have been posed as requests for quotations for participation in a vaccine program.\u201dThere have been signs for months that cybercriminals saw COVID-19 as a money-making opportunity.COVID vaccine manufacturer Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories was forced to shut down factories in Brazil, India, the U.K. and U.S. in late October, which were contracted to make the Russian vaccine \u201cSputnik V.\u201d \u00a0And the APT group DarkHotel targeted the World Health Organization last March, in an attempt to steal any information they could find related to tests, vaccines or trial cures.And just last month, antigen firm Miltenyi, which manufactures critical supplies for testing and treatment of COVID-19, fell victim to a malware attack, which slowed communications and operations across its operation spread across 73 countries.And there doesn\u2019t seem to be any relief in sight for already beleaguered pharmaceutical and healthcare teams anywhere in the world, meaning general security vigilance, even under these stressful circumstances, is more important than ever.\u201cThere\u2019s been an intense upscale in attacks,\u201d Chlo\u00e9 Messdaghi, vice president of strategy at Point3 Security told Threatpost. \u201cAnything connected to sensitive data for COVID-19 is definitely under threat by foreign nation-state actors or foreign competing companies looking to find usable information.

        "raw text": "A security flaw on a website set up to gather evidence of in-person voter fraud in Arizona would have opened the door for SQL injection and other attacks.The bug, found on a site set up by the Trump campaign called dontpressthegreenbutton.com, was discovered by cybersecurity pro Todd Rossin, almost by accident.The researcher saw a news story about alleged voter fraud in Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Scottsdale and the main bulk of Arizona\u2019s population. The article explained that the Trump campaign has filed a lawsuit alleging that voters were tricked by poll workers into submitting ballots with errors, overriding the system by pressing a green button. The news article linked to the site associated with the suit, dontpressthegreenbutton.com, which said it is collecting legal, sworn declarations of such fraud to be used as evidence.Rossin clicked on the site and started poking around.\u201cI went to the Green Button site and made up a name, and [then] saw all these other voters\u2019 names and addresses pop up,\u201d Rossin told Threatpost. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for it but was surprised to see it.\u201dRossin shared his findings on Reddit under his username BattyBoomDaddy, and the post quickly gained traction, racking up nearly 250 comments and more than 7,600 upvotes so far.\u201cSomeone\u2026ran a script to test out how easy it would be to pull the data and change the parameters to start with the letter \u2018A\u2019 and to stop at the first 5,000 entries \u2013 and bam, the first 5,000 names and addresses,\u201d Rossin explained. \u201cSomeone else used a SQL injection to pull names, addresses, dates-of-birth (DOBs) and last four of Social Security numbers.\u201dPlenty of voter data is public in Arizona \u2013 but Social Security numbers and DoBs are supposed to be kept confidential.API and SQL Injection Rossin told Threatpost that he, along with others, reported the breach to the Maricopa County Elections Department.\u201cThis is a perfect example of \u2018rushing to market,\u2019 as it is clear that this site was rushed with little to no thought given to security,\u201d Ray Kelly, principal security engineer at WhiteHat Security, told Threatpost. \u201cFor example, a simple automated security scan would certainly have found the SQL-injection vulnerability in minutes and prevented the sensitive data from being pulled from their database.\u201dThe Green Button site.Infosec professional Richey Ward saw Rossin\u2019s post and decided to do a little digging of his own. Ward shared his findings on Twitter, where he explained that he was able to access full names and addresses of 163,000 voters, tagging the Maricopa County Elections Department. While this information is made publicly accessible to campaigns, Arizona law prohibits it from being shared via the web.\u201cTracing this to a Algolia API call is trivial, alongside API keys,\u201d Ward wrote. \u201cThis allows anyone with the keys to query the data outside the website.\u201dJust hours later, Ward found that the API was taken down and no longer accessible.\u201cI was happy that people recognized it was a big deal,\u201d Rossin added. \u201cI also looked up Arizona law on it, and the law specifically says that the information is not to be distributed, and especially says not on the internet.\u201dAnd while the obvious security vulnerabilities associated with the Green Button site have been addressed, Rossin said the site is still far from secure.\u201cYes, they pulled the API down,\u201d Rossin told Threatpost. \u201cIt still has very lax security.\u201dRejected Voter Lawsuit Threatpost hasn\u2019t been successful in multiple attempts to contact the attorney behind the Green Button lawsuit, Alexander Kolodin, or his firm, Kolodin Law group.The security issue comes to light amid attacks targeting voters and voter data. Just a month ago, in the leadup to the election, voters were victimized by a phishing lure trying to convince them to give up their information. And election cybersecurity more generally is a crucial point of focus for campaigns and law-enforcement officials. It\u2019s up to campaigns to make sure they\u2019re keeping their eye on security in all phases of their outreach.\u201cLooking at the evidence so far, it does indeed look like an issue for voter-data exposure,\u201d Brandon Hoffman, CISO at Netenrich, said about the site. \u201cThese political campaigns, in their haste, are doing more damage to people than the good they can hope to deliver. While everybody understands the desire and need for transparency and a fair outcome for all, they also have the utmost responsibility to voters to keep our information protected if they plan to use it.\u201dDespite the reported security vulnerabilities, the dontouchthegreenbutton.com site assures visitors, \u201cThe Republican National Committee and Donald J. Trump for President Inc. will not disclose personally identifying information except as required by law.\u201dNetenrich added although this particular breach is associated with the Trump campaign, neither political party is effectively protecting voter data. In September, the official application of the Joe Biden campaign was found to have a privacy issue.The\u00a0Vote Joe app allows users to share data about themselves and their contacts with a voter database run by Target Smart.\u00a0 The\u00a0App Analyst noted at the time that \u201can issue occurs when the contact in the phone does not correspond with the voter, but the data continues to enrich the voter database entry. By adding fake contacts to the device, a user is able to sync these with real voters.\u201d The issue is now resolved.\u201cBoth campaigns have now provided exposures of data for voters with no apparent ramifications,\u201d Netenrich said. \u201cIf a lay person put up a website leaking Social Security numbers and addresses of people, they would likely be in jail and under litigation. The companies and campaigns that are using personally identifiable information of Americans must take the time and diligence to protect that data.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

In a\u00a0typical BEC attack, criminals will do their research to make their communications seem credible, according to Agari\u2019s recent\u00a0deep dive on the state of BEC attacks.\u201cCybercriminals, using a sophisticated phishing attack, stole funds intended for the re-election of President Trump, altered invoices and committed wire fraud,\u201d Wisconsin state party Chair Andrew Hitt said in a statement announcing the incident. \u201cThese criminals exhibited a level of familiarity with state party operations at the end of the campaign to commit this crime.\u201dResearchers disagreed with the \u201csophisticated\u201d claim: \u201cWhile this scam may look sophisticated, this is fairly simple and reflects the vulnerability of any organization that has not digitized their spend management processes,\u201d Alex Saric, CMO of Ivalua said. \u201cInvoicing is an area ripe for fraudsters and cybercriminals, who know employees may not always question their validity, particularly if they look convincing.\u201dThat tracks with Hitt\u2019s explanation about the scammers\u2019 familiarity with party operations. These financially motivated criminals will often sit and monitor inboxes they\u2019ve compromised for quite some time. In this instance they were able to get enough insight into the Wisconsin GOP\u2019s day-to-day dealings that they could doctor MAGA-hat invoices, according to reports. They used the names of existing vendors to the party and made the invoices look close enough to the real thing to get them paid.The Wisconsin GOP said that no proprietary information was compromised in the attack, and that the state party still has enough cash on hand to keep the operation going.\u201cWhile a large sum of money was stolen, our operation is running at full capacity with all the resources deployed to ensure President Donald J. Trump carries Wisconsin on November 3rd,\u201d Hitt added.Cybercrime Isn\u2019t Partisan The Wisconsin GOP isn\u2019t alone. According to Agari\u2019s most recent count, BEC attacks make up 40 percent of all cybercrime losses, impacting more than 177 countries across the world.But as the election approaches and campaign activity amps up to its most furious pace in the final days before the election, political operations will be a particularly juicy target for cybercriminals, warned Ken Liao, vice president of cybersecurity strategy and Abnormal Security.\u201cPolitical candidates, their staffs and the organizations they work with will always be targets for malicious actors,\u201d Liao said. \u201cEmail-based attacks \u2014 and more specifically attacks perpetrating invoice fraud\u00a0\u00a0\u2014 are one of the more common methods used by hackers to gain access to sensitive information. As we get closer to the election, attackers will count on the fact that staffers will be busier and stretched thin, making it easier to induce a security lapse.\u201dWhich requires political staff and elections officials to be more diligent than normal (especially when things around them are anything but normal). It\u2019s not a simple ask \u2014 which is precisely what malicious actors are banking on to help fuel their scams, Liao added.\u201cAll it takes is one errant click from a single member of a campaign staff,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly important for employees to be vigilant and ensure that anything they open or click on is from a trusted source. At the same time, employers need to have detection capabilities that can automatically identify signals coming from email traffic that poses a threat.\u201dCampaign operations have also largely gone mobile, adding another layer of exposure to attacks, according to Hack Schless, who works in security solutions at Lookout.\u201cCampaign workers communicate directly with reporters and coordinate with other staffers over messaging apps and SMS,\u201d Schless said. \u201cThey also need to run their candidates\u2019 social-media accounts. SMS, social media, and third-party messaging platforms are three of the most popular platforms threat actors use to socially-engineer targets into falling for phishing attempts. It\u2019s gone so far as the DNC warning campaign workers against social engineering through dating apps in a statement issued earlier this year.\u201dThe goal of these attempts is to trick staffers into giving up their credentials, Schless added.\u201cThey want to gain access to the campaign\u2019s infrastructure to steal data or resources normally accessed by that individual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attacker can carry out their campaign through SMS, email, iMessage, social media platforms, third-party messaging apps and more.\u201dRecent Election-Related Attacks All of this is against the backdrop of no shortage of attacks on the election this year.For instance, Iranian actors posing as the hate group \u201cProud Boys\u201d launched email campaigns against registered Democrats with threatening messages to \u201cvote for Trump or else,\u201d using stolen voter-registration data.Last week Georgia\u2019s database of voter signatures was impacted by a ransomware attack on Hall County, Ga.And just days ago the Trump Campaign website was defaced with a cryptocurrency scam, briefly displaying a message from scammers claiming to have \u201cstrictly classified information.\u201dThe added fog of highly charged, partisan politics only serves to help criminals, Tom Pendergast, chief learning officer at MediaPro said.\u201cWe must remember as this story unfolds that this is not a partisan issue,\u201d he noted. \u201cNow, it may be partisan in that the cybercriminals behind this attack may prefer one party over the other (though it\u2019s not clear which party is advantaged here). And we can be sure it will get twisted to partisan ends.\u201dHe adds any attacks on our elections need to be met with a unified American front.\u201cHowever, the way we respond to it should NOT be partisan,\u201d Pendergast continued. \u201cMaking voting and email and digital transactions and the internet safe for everyone should be an issue we can all get behind. No one gains from cybercrime and no one gains from election fraud, if what we ultimately care about is a stable democracy.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "Researchers with White Ops have\u00a0uncovered a scam to deliver millions of out-of-context (OOC) ads through a group of more than 240 Android applications on the official Google Play store, which the team said were collectively delivering more than 15 million impressions per day at their peak.The apps have since been purged from Google Play, but users should delete them off their phones as well. The full list is available here.The apps worked the way they were supposed to, for the most part, making them all the more effective at hiding in plain sight. Most were simple retro games like Nintendo NES emulators, and used \u201cpacker\u201d software to bypass protections. The apps would then \u00a0deliver OOC ads disguised to appear as if they were from reputable sources like Chrome and YouTube, according to the White Ops team.\u201cThe main tool in the adware developer\u2019s arsenal are the packers,\u201d Gabriel Cirlig, principal threat intelligence analyst for White Ops, told Threatpost. \u201cThey cloak and allow a threat to exist under the guise of intellectual property protection. However, once they passed any antivirus [protections] a user might have, the OOC ads were able to stay undetected for a period of time by pretending to be coming from popular applications and social-media platforms, such as YouTube and Chrome. Because of this, users think the ads are coming from legitimate platforms and do not get suspicious.\u201dThe White Ops team of researchers, including Cirling, Michael Gethers, Lisa Gansky and Dina Haines,\u00a0 \u2014 who named the investigation \u201cRAINBOWMIX,\u201d inspired by the 8-16 bit color palate running throughout the retro game apps \u2014 found that these fraudulent apps were downloaded more than 14 million times by unsuspecting users.How RAINBOWMIX Infiltrated User Devices\u00a0 The various applications\u2019 reviews show there wasn\u2019t a lot of attention being paid to the RAINBOWMIX group.\u201cMost of the RAINBOWMIX apps have a \u201cC-shaped rating distribution curve (with primarily one- and five-star reviews, which is common with suspect apps),\u201d the team reported.All of the RAINBOWMIX apps were loaded with the Tencent Legu packer, they add, noting that some did give clues to their nefarious intent, if you looked hard enough.\u201cIt is worth noting that even while packed, these apps exhibit some potentially suspicious behavior corresponding to the interstitial component of the\u00a0ad SDKs, which are renamed with labels that point to well-known apps,\u201d the researchers said.How RAINBOWMIX Fooled the SystemThe team also noticed triggers for services and receivers inside the apps\u2019 manifests which shouldn\u2019t have been there, including upon system boot, during connection changes, when a charging chord is plugged in or out, and during app installations. The assessment is that these were used to \u201cconfuse analysts and trick static-analysis engines,\u201d the report read.The analysts were able to pinpoint that the trigger for OOC ads \u201cresides in the service com.timuz.a,\u201d adding it was present in every one of the RAINBOWMIX group of applications.\u201cThe receiver com.google.android.gms.common.license.a is a simple wrapper that tries to keep the service com.timuz.a running and sets up the out-of-context ad loop. It is contained in all bundles in the appendix,\u201d the report said.The service com.timuz.a gets its orders from a command-and-control server (C2), the researchers were able to discover, despite the C2 URL being buried behind base64 coding. After that connection with the C2 is established, another service takes over (com.ironsource.sdk.handlers.a.a), and attempts to deliver an OOC ad every 10 minutes, according to the report findings.\u201cIt is important to note that while com.ironsource.sdk.handlers.a.a is a legit SDK, ironSource is unlikely involved or aware of the abuse,\u201d researchers said.The C2 domain (api[.]pythonexample[.]com) meanwhile has been identified by the group as a \u201clikely hacked website.\u201d Research showed that the site was posted with a question on an online forum two years ago, but now it defaults to a Ngnix page.Once the C2 connection is made, a secondary URL (hxxp://api[.]pythonexample[.]com/xyyx?pn=com.androidapk.gbaemulator) is contacted and a JSON payload downloaded. After that, researchers could see ads being played on a compromised device, with nothing from than a small icon to alert the user was getting data from another app than the one they were running.\u201cThis is used as the C2 of the ad SDK, which determines which ad network to use as well as the interstitials frequency,\u201d the report read. \u201cThe same C2 architecture is used across all of the RAINBOWMIX apps identified in this investigation.\u201dThe RAINBOWMIX apps were also able to boost their ad-delivery counts by monitoring when users turned their screen on and off, the analysts also discovered. \u201cThe code responsible for detecting screen on/off events was placed inside a fake Unity class \u2018com.unity.b.\u2019,\u201d they explained.The Impact of RAINBOWMIX & OOC AdsOutside of the nuisance factor for users, delivering OOC ads damages every legit advertiser out there relying on consumers to trust the messages they consume online, White Ops pointed out.\u201cAlongside the usual fraudulent aspect of delivering ads that don\u2019t have the same impact as a legitimate ones with users dismissing them on the spot, they also lower brand trust by masquerading as legitimate applications that would never spam the user in such as manner as the one presented,\u201d Cirlig said.The team found the majority (nearly 21 percent) of traffic came from Brazil, followed closely by Indonesia and Vietnam. The U.S. represented 7.7 percent of the traffic to RAINBOWMIX OOC ads.Keywords: Out of Context ads, OOC ads, malware, RAINBOWMIX, White Ops, Google Play, emulator, Nintendo, retro games, 8-16 bit color palate, android, google play, malicious ads, ad fraud, white opsMalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals are tapping into Amazon\u2019s annual discount shopping campaign for subscribers, Prime Day, with researchers warning of a\u00a0recent spike in phishing and malicious websites that are fraudulently using the Amazon brand.There has been a spike in the number of new monthly phishing and fraudulent sites created using the Amazon brand since August, the most significant since the COVID-19 pandemic forced people indoors in March, according to a Thursday report from Bolster Research.Click to Register!\u201cAs shoppers gear up for two days of great deals, cyber criminals are preparing to prey on the unwary, taking advantage of those who let their guard down to snap up bargains,\u201d researchers wrote.Prime Day actually happens over two days\u2014this year the event falls on Oct. 13 to 14. Amazon Prime customers enjoy special sales and discounts on top brands to mark the biggest shopping event of the year on the online retail giant\u2019s site.Amazon last year yielded over $7 billion in sales during the 36-hour event, which could go even bigger this year due to \u201cthe decline of brick and mortar retail and the close proximity to the holidays,\u201d researchers noted. Indeed, mandatory stay-at-home orders globally that began with the COVID-19 pandemic in March have significantly boosted Amazon\u2019s business, a trend that shows no signs of abating.Researchers analyzed hundreds of millions of web pages to track the number of new phishing and fraudulent sites using the Amazon brand and logos. Its research shows threat actors taking advantage of both Amazon features and consumer behaviors to try to lure online shoppers to fraudulent sites that can steal their credentials, financial information and other sensitive data.One new campaign targets \u201creturns\u201d or \u201corder cancellations\u201d related to Prime Day using a fraudulent site, www.amazoncustomersupport[.]net, that mimics a legitimate Amazon site. However, closer examination of the site shows it is clearly designed to defraud consumers, researchers noted.One clear evidence is its use of a phone number, as \u201cAmazon does not encourage customer service by phone, and takes a great effort to find phone support on the real Amazon site,\u201d researchers wrote.The form on the site also requests bank or credit card information from customers\u2013a clear intent to steal this information, since Amazon always offers refunds to original form of payment or gift cards. Further, the site also does not ask for a customer password, something Amazon always requires for purchases and returns.Other smaller issues that might be overlooked\u2014such as broken links attached to the Amazon Prime Logo and a \u201cGet Started\u201d button\u2013also appear on the site. These also are clues to fraudulent behavior that shoppers should look out for in general as they shop on Prime Day, researchers noted.Another malicious site recently observed by researchers takes advantage of most consumers\u2019 inherent love of a free gift. The site, www.fr-suivre[.]vip, promotes an Amazon loyalty program and offers a free iPhone 11 Pro if people answer a few survey questions. After answering these questions, people are directed to a simple game that they win, after which they\u2019re asked to enter credit card info so the site can charge them $1 to receive the iPhone.The site even includes a screenshot in which \u201cthe free iPhone is validated by many others who have already received their phones,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cDespite the glowing reviews, the $999 phone will never arrive, and the shopper begins to see strange charges on the credit card number provided,\u201d they warned.Fortunately for Amazon Prime customers who plan to take advantage of the event this year\u2014or anyone else shopping Amazon these days\u2014avoiding online fraud is not that difficult, researchers said. All shoppers should start directly at the source\u2014Amazon.com\u2014and pay close attention to their experience to ensure that nothing is out of the ordinary.\u201cShoppers need to be aware of cyber criminals prepared to take advantage of the situation,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cWith some diligence and attention to detail, shoppers will be able to get those deals without getting scammed.\u201dAmazon, too, can take even more security steps to protect customers as its business continues to boom, with cybercrime inevitably following suit, observed Kevin Beasley, CIO at enterprise management software provider VAI.\u201cTo minimize the risk of data breaches or security issues, retailers, like Amazon, must install additional multi-factor authentication for logins and policies to protect passwords and who has access to data,\u201d he said in an email to Threatpost.Online retailers across the board also should get out ahead of the busy holiday season by making their platform \u201ca security-first environment,\u201d Beasley said.This can be done \u201cby installing additional layers of security infrastructure between the operating system and hardware platform, and continuous security testing and automating scans of hardware and software systems to seek out vulnerabilities and patch potential issues as they arise,\u201d he told Threatpost.On October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "Account takeover (ATO) attacks are on the rise, and in fact have become a go-to attack of choice cybercriminals of all stripes. In fact, in 2019 alone, ATO attacks cost consumers and e-commerce retailers a whopping $16.9 billion in losses.To be clear, ATO fraud isn\u2019t new, it\u2019s been a concern for online retailers for a decade. But Sift recently released its 2020 Digital Trust & Safety Index, which found that ATO attacks have jumped dramatically, by 282 percent, between Q2 2019 and Q2 2020, driven by a rise in digital business and a jump in online shopping since the COVID-19 outbreak last spring. The number of stolen credentials for sale on the dark web is meanwhile up 300 percent.In a typical ATO attack, criminals use automated bots to crisscross the web and enter stolen credentials into online accounts \u2013 and they also try to search for clues to crack passwords and security codes to cash in further.Undoubtedly, COVID-19 has driven more online retail activity, creating an even more target-rich environment for ATO fraudsters. But retailers are unintentionally making themselves more susceptible, too, according to Sift\u2019s report. One-click, on-demand and mobile solutions, intended to make the shopping experience simple, also have the unintended consequence of making consumer data easier to steal. Sift\u2019s report calls this a \u201cCatch-22\u201d for retailers in trying to balance \u201cconcerns of fraud and friction.\u201dThe \u201cfriction\u201d is the series barriers to fraud; tools like two-factor and multifactor authentication, biometrics, CAPTCHA codes and the like. The \u201ccatch\u201d is that the more of these barriers you place in front of a shopper, the more likely retailers are to see a jump in abandoned carts and irritated customers repeatedly being asked to input their sensitive data.ATO fraud victims have been exposed across all kinds of sites \u2014 dating, travel, banking and social media \u2014 meaning consumers are at risk almost anywhere they go online shop or buy services.But hardest hit, according to Sift\u2019s report, have been online sellers of physical goods. ATO fraud is up 378 percent among physical e-commerce marketplaces. Criminals have also become adept at exploiting new buy online, pick up in store sales models (BOPIS) which have become a go-to solution for low-contact shopping during the pandemic. Fraudsters buy goods online with stolen credentials, pick them up, then return them to resell for a quick profit.And the cost to online retailers goes far beyond the initial fraud. More than half (56 percent), of customers surveyed by Sift said that if they discovered that their personal data was compromised, they would stop doing business with site and choose another provider.So, ATO fraud is a real threat to brand loyalty.Also, forget the tired stereotype of the hoodie-wearing hacker trying to steal credentials from a basement. ATO criminals have evolved into well-funded, well-organized, state-sponsored actors, according to Sift.\u201cThe lonely, disgruntled, hacker trope has mutated into far-reaching, state-sponsored teams of fraudsters who are just as focused on efficiency, expansion and ROI as any e-commerce merchant,\u201d the report said.They\u2019ve also become adept at hiding their fraud behind periodic traffic spikes. In Sept. 2019, cybercriminals used the back-to-school and start of the holiday shopping seasons to hide their nefarious activity behind already bogged-down systems, Sift said.The 2020 Digital Trust and Safety Index was complied through a survey of Sift\u2019s global network of more than 34,000 sites and apps, in addition to more than 1,000 customers contacted throughout August.On October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "More than half of global airlines do not have DMARC\u00a0policies in place, opening their customers up to email fraud attacks, a new report found.DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) is considered the industry standard for email authentication to prevent attackers from sending mails with counterfeit addresses. It does so by authenticating the sender\u2019s identity before allowing the message to reach its intended designation \u2013 and verifying that the purported domain of the sender has not been impersonated.In a study of 296 member airlines of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), researchers with Proofpoint found that\u00a061 percent have no published DMARC record in place, meaning they have no visibility into unauthorized use of their domains \u2013 and therefore into fraudulent emails claiming to be from them.\u201cOverall, major global carriers are failing to implement adequate email protection \u2013 leaving themselves open to phishing, impersonation attacks and other unauthorized use of corporate domains. This is despite email remaining the number one threat vector for cybercriminals,\u201d according to Adenike Cosgrove with Proofpoint in a Tuesday report.Even out of those who do have DMARC records in place, most are not using the strictest DMARC settings, according to Proofpoint. They said, up to 93 percent of global airlines do not have the \u201crecommended\u201d level of DMARC protection policies in place,\u00a0known as the \u201cReject\u201d policy.There are three levels of DMARC policies. In the strictest \u201cReject\u201d policy,\u00a0companies can blocks all fraudulent emails from reaching their intended target.\u00a0As part of the second level, the \u201cQuarantine\u201d policy, companies tell email receivers to put the potentially spoofed emails into spam or junk folders. With the third level, \u201cMonitor,\u201d companies do not tell the email receiver to do anything with emails sent, but they instead analyze who is sending emails on their behalf.\u201cThis means that only 7 percent are proactively blocking fraudulent emails from reaching their customers\u2019 inboxes,\u201d Cosgrove said.IATA is a trade association of the world\u2019s airlines across 120 countries and represents 82 percent of total air traffic\u00a0\u2013 including airlines like Delta Airlines, JetBlue and British Airways. IATA supports airline activity and helps formulate industry policy and standards.Researchers did not pinpoint specific airlines in the report. However, Threatpost independently\u00a0confirmed (using DMARC deployment lookup tools) that several top airlines have varying levels of DMARC policies implemented. For instance, Delta Airlines uses the \u201cMonitor\u201d policy; while British Airways,\u00a0Southwest and JetBlue use the \u201cReject\u201d policy.DMARC adoption for airlines levels differ from region to region. Researchers said that out of the regions classified by IATA, the China and North Asia region has the lowest level of DMARC adoption, with 85 percent having no published policy at all.Out of the 47 airlines from the Americas region, meanwhile, 89 percent are not blocking fraudulent emails from reaching customers with the highest level of DMARC protections, while 42 percent have no DMARC record in place.The study of airline\u2019s DMARC policies come as adoption of the email security protocol is actually ticking upwards, with the number of domains deploying DMARC records surpassing 1 million in the last two years \u2014 a 2.5 times greater total than in 2018.However, some industries \u2013 including higher education \u2013 continue to lag behind in adoption.\u00a0Worse, with COVID-19 causing a flurry of cancelled flights and changed schedules,\u00a0the travel sector has \u201coffered new grounds for the targeting of travellers globally\u201d \u2013 and that extends to email communications, said Cosgrove.\u201cIt is critically important that the communication methods used by airlines and every other industry is secure. We recommend implementing robust email defences and inbound threat blocking capabilities (including deploying DMARC email authentication protocols),\u201d said Cosgrove.Airlines have faced criticism over the years from the security industry. In 2019, security researchers discovered that multiple airline e-ticketing systems do not encrypt check-in links. The security faux pas could allow bad actors on the same network as the victim to view \u2013 and in some cases even change \u2013 their flight booking details or boarding passes. Also in 2019, a security bug discovered in British Airways\u2019 e-ticketing system had the potential to expose passengers\u2019 data, including their flight booking details and personal information. As recently as 2020, both European budget airline EasyJet and the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) were hacked.\u00a0It\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

        "raw text": "The U.S. Secret Service has created the Cyber Fraud Task Forces (CFTFs), aimed at preventing, detecting and mitigating complex cyber-enabled financial crime \u2013 including making arrests and convictions.The CFTF is the result of a formal merging of two of the Secret Service\u2019s existing units into a single unified network. The Electronic Crimes Task Forces (ECTFs) and the Financial Crimes Task Forces (FCTFs), the division said in a recent media statement. The driver for the move is the fact that online cybercrime and financial fraud have converged to the point that it\u2019s impossible to address one without including the other, it said.\u201cIn today\u2019s environment, no longer can investigators effectively pursue a financial or cybercrime investigation without understanding both the financial and internet sectors, as well as the technologies and institutions that power each industry,\u201d officials said. \u201cSecret Service investigations today require the skills, technologies and strategic partnerships in both the cyber and financial realms.\u201dIn fact, nearly all of the Secret Service\u2019s traditional financial crime investigations make use of digital evidence, and the group acknowledged that increasing technological sophistication on the part of bad actors has led to a proliferation of blended cyber-enabled financial crimes. Those include business email compromise (BECs) scams, ransomware attacks, data breaches and the sale of stolen credit cards and personal information on the internet.\u201cThe creation of the new Cyber Fraud Task Forces (CFTF), will offer a specialized cadre of agents and analysts, trained in the latest analytical techniques and equipped with the most cutting-edge technologies,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Ambrosio, assistant director of the Secret Service. \u201cTogether with our partners, the CFTFs stand ready to combat the full range of cyber-enabled financial crimes. As the nation continues to grapple with the wave of cybercrime associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the CFTFs will lead the effort to hold accountable all those who seek to exploit this perilous moment for their own illicit gain.\u201dKeith McCammon, chief security officer and co-founder of Red Canary said that an overwhelming majority of threat actors are financially motivated.\u201cThese criminals manipulate software, end users and a wide variety of financial services and technologies with increasing sophistication to achieve their objectives,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThe wide variety of technical and financial systems in play can be viewed as complicating factors in investigations, and they are. But every system that a criminal uses presents an opportunity to identify, track and ultimately disrupt their operations.\u201dThe Secret Service also said that it has broken up \u201chundreds\u201d of COVID19-related cyber-fraud scams since March, when coronavirus lockdowns went into place around the country. It thus has prevented tens of millions of dollars in fraud from occurring, officials said.In terms of specific wins, the Secret Service has halted the illicit sales of online stolen COVID-19 test kits, and is now leading a \u201cnationwide effort to investigate and counter a vast transnational unemployment fraud scheme targeting the U.S. state unemployment programs,\u201d according to the Secret Service.The Secret Service has 42 domestic CFTF locations with two international locations, in London and Rome. The law-enforcement group said that it plans to further extend the CFTF network to include as many as 160 offices across the country and around the globe.\u201cOur success requires that investigators have a holistic understanding of modern criminal operations, from how they target and interact with victims to how they get paid, so that any mistake along the way can be used to the advantage of law enforcement,\u201d McCammon said. \u201cBy combining the Financial and Electronic Crimes Task Forces, our expertise across domains can be leveraged more effectively, putting the Secret Service and its partners in a vastly improved position to understand, disrupt, and prosecute modern frauds.\u201dBEC and enterprise email fraud is surging, but DMARC can help \u2013 if it\u2019s done right. On July 15 at 2 p.m. ET, join Valimail Global Technical Director Steve Whittle and Threatpost for a FREE webinar, \u201cDMARC: 7 Common Business Email Mistakes.\u201d This technical \u201cbest practices\u201d session will cover constructing, configuring, and managing email authentication protocols to ensure your organization is protected.

        "raw text": "Mobile carriers have left the door wide open to SIM-swap attacks, particularly when it comes to prepaid accounts, researchers have found.SIM swapping is a form of fraud that allows crooks to bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and crack online banking or other high-value accounts. According to PhishLabs, a typical attack would start with an attacker phishing personal and banking information \u2013 often via SMS phishing, which has the added benefit of confirming that a victim\u2019s cell phone number is an active line. Then, the next step is to call the person\u2019s mobile carrier \u2013 easily discovered with an online search \u2013 and ask to port the line to a different SIM card/device.Here\u2019s where the issue comes in: Many carriers don\u2019t ask in-depth security questions that fully verify that the caller is in fact the legitimate cell phone user, according to a recent academic experiment. Thus, fraudsters are able to transfer the line to a device that they control \u2013 thereby putting themselves into position to intercept 2FA text codes. From there, it\u2019s easy to use the previously phished information to gain access to and take over an account.The primary check in this kill chain should clearly be the mobile carrier\u2019s verification processes. However, according to a recent Princeton University study, researchers tested five North American prepaid telecom companies (AT&T, T-Mobile, Tracfone, US Mobile and Verizon Wireless) to see if they could successfully port their own number to another SIM card. In trying 10 times each with each carrier, they found that they could do so in most cases, thanks to a lack of strong verification processes.\u201cAll five carriers used insecure authentication challenges that could easily be subverted by attackers,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWe also found that in general, callers only needed to successfully respond to one challenge in order to authenticate, even if they had failed numerous prior challenges. Within each carrier, procedures were generally consistent, although on nine occasions across two carriers, [customer service representatives] CSRs either did not authenticate the caller or leaked account information prior to authentication.\u201dFurther, the experiment was structured so that no advanced fraud tactics were used.\u201cOur simulated attacker knew only information about the victim that would be easily accessible without overcoming any other security measures,\u201d the report explained. \u201cSpecifically, our attacker knew the victim\u2019s name and phone number. We also assumed that the attacker was capable of interacting with the carrier only through its ordinary customer service and account refill interfaces.\u201dThe researchers began by telling the CSRs that they needed to use a new SIM card because the old one was faulty. After that, CSRs typically posed authentication questions, usually asking for one of the following: An account PIN, \u00a0recently dialed numbers (call logs), personal information like date of birth or billing address, model numbers or other device information, answers to security questions (i.e., \u201cin what city were you born\u201d), and so on.If the callers could not answer an authentication challenge correctly, the tactic was to claim to have forgotten the information or to provide incorrect answers.\u201cWhen providing incorrect answers to personal questions such as date of birth or billing ZIP code, [research assistants] would explain that they had been careless at signup, possibly having provided incorrect information, and could not recall the information they had used,\u201d the report outlined.The CSRs would then often provide hints, which could help the \u201cattackers\u201d to locate the correct information via online searches.The results of the SIM-swap attempts are collected below:Many of the authentication methods could be subverted with slightly more sophisticated attack skills, the report noted. For instance, to provide an outgoing number from the call log, an attacker could send the victim a vague text asking for a callback for some purported urgent request. In order to capture device information, a malicious app could be employed to harvest it. If asked for the date or amount of the last payment, an attacker could purchase a refill card at a retail store, submit a refill on the victim\u2019s account, then request a SIM swap using the known refill as authentication.It may seem like a lot of effort to subvert some of these authentication challenges, but the payoff can be huge when you\u2019re talking about corporate targets. PhishLabs pointed out in a Thursday posting on the attack method that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey was a victim of the tactic; and in another known case, an attack resulted in the victim having a Coinbase account emptied that was worth around $100,000 in cryptocurrency.\u201cThough still uncommon, mobile phone customers in the U.S. and Canada are the prime targets of these attacks and their private accounts such as their banking information is the end goal,\u201d the firm said.After disclosing the findings to the carriers in question, the Princeton researchers got little response. They noted: \u201cIn July 2019 we provided an initial notification of our findings to the carriers we studied and to CTIA, the U.S. trade association representing the wireless communications industry. In January 2020, T-Mobile informed us that after reviewing our research, it has discontinued the use of call logs for customer authentication.\u201dThreatpost reached out to the carriers for comment.The research echoes previous findings that also illustrated the lack of strong authentication at mobile carrier call centers. At the Security Analyst Summit in Singapore last year, David Jacoby, a Swedish member of Kaspersky\u2019s global research and analysis team (GReAT), explained how Swedish telcos ask only for a bare minimum of information from callers \u2013 and publicly available information at that \u2013 before agreeing to make account changes to specific numbers. This has led to real-world attacks where victims have found their mobile phone calls hijacked and redirected to a rogue number.In terms of mitigation, some say that relying on standard fraud-detection technologies isn\u2019t a perfect solution for corporations looking to protect themselves from these kinds of attacks.\u201cThere are two approaches you can use to combat SIM-swap attacks, namely detection and prevention,\u201d said Dewald Nolte, chief commercial officer at Entersekt. \u201cDue to the way that the industry uses SMS-based verification codes, detection is not always a fail-safe way of eliminating this type of attack. It can certainly make life more difficult for the perpetrator, but there are advanced techniques available to get around most of the detection techniques.\u201dIn its writeup, PhishLabs noted that targeted organizations can instead reduce the threat of SIM-swap attacks to account security by using 2FA methods that can\u2019t be exploited remotely, such as security keys that require the user to have physical possession of a token to unlock an account.Concerned about mobile security?

        "raw text": "Facebook has sued a Chinese company that it alleges used malware to compromise hundreds of thousands of user accounts \u2013 and then used them to run \u201cdeceptive ads\u201d promoting counterfeit goods.The company in question is Hong Kong-based ILikeAd Media International Company Ltd., which was incorporated in 2016. On its website (ilikead.com, which appears to be down) the company said it provides advertising and marketing services to businesses interested in advertising on Facebook, according to court documents. Facebook also sued Chinese software developer Chen Xiao Cong and marketing director Huang Tao in connection with the scheme.\u201cTo protect Facebook users and disrupt these types of schemes, we will continue our work to detect malicious behavior directed towards our platform and enforce against violations of our Terms and Policies,\u201d said Jessica Romero, director of Platform Enforcement and Litigation and Rob Leathern, director of Product Management and Business Integrity with Facebook, in a Thursday statement. \u201cCreating real-world consequences for those who deceive users and engage in cloaking schemes is important in maintaining the integrity of our platform.\u201dBetween 2016 up until August 2019, Cong and Tao allegedly created malware, tricked victims into installing it, and then compromised their Facebook accounts. The malware was promoted through various forums and websites; once installed, it would then collect Facebook login credentials from the victims\u2019 browsers, enabling access. The malware also disabled accounts\u2019 security notifications so victims were unaware they were compromised, court documents said.Once infected by malware, the company used victims\u2019 accounts to promote deceptive ads would promote shoddy items such as diet pills and male enhancement products, sometimes using images of celebrities in the ads to entice people to click on them, Facebook said. Cong and Tao were also allegedly able to promote the ads using victims\u2019 payment information connected to their ad accounts.These ads used a method called \u201ccloaking,\u201d where they deliberately disguised the true destination of the URL in the ad by displaying one version of an ad\u2019s landing page to Facebook\u2019s systems and a different version \u2013 usually hosting malicious content \u2013 to Facebook users.\u201cCloaking schemes are often sophisticated and well-organized, making the individuals and organizations behind them difficult to identify and hold accountable,\u201d according to Facebook. \u201cAs a result, there have not been many legal actions of this kind. In this case, we have refunded victims whose accounts were used to run unauthorized ads and helped them to secure their accounts.\u201dCourt documents said that Facebook has paid over $4 million to victims to reimburse them for the unauthorized ads purchased using their ad accounts.Facebook has filed lawsuits against a slew of other companies for privacy and security-related reasons, including two app developers over click-fraud injection in August and two\u00a0Ukrainian men\u00a0in March that it alleged stole data from 63,000 platform users for advertising purposes.Mike Bittner, director of Digital Security and Operations for The Media Trust, said that with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) going into effect Jan. 1, companies like Facebook (and Microsoft, among others) are revisiting privacy measures of their platforms. The law demands more transparency from companies about how user data is being used and disseminated and requires them to give consumers a way to opt out of these actions.\u201cWith CCPA enforcement just a few weeks away, it makes sense for covered platforms and websites to start enforcing their privacy and security policies and hold errant or malicious third parties to account,\u201d Bittner, said in an email. \u201cThe penalties for noncompliance are high, especially those linked to the law\u2019s Private Right of Action, which can amount to $7,500 per violation.\u201dFree Threatpost Webinar:\u00a0Risk around third-party vendors is real and can lead to data disasters.

        "raw text": "Google has removed two malicious ad blockers from its Chrome Web Store after a researcher discovered they were carrying out ad fraud and deceived Chrome users by using names of legitimate and popular blockers.Researcher Andrey Meshkov from rival ad blocker maker AdGuard discovered that the extensions \u201cAdBlock\u201d and \u201cuBlock\u201d found in the store were fraudulent and alerted users in a blog post.Rather than legitimately block ads on websites\u2014the obvious purpose of this type of browser extension\u2013the malicious blockers perform what\u2019s called \u201ccookie stuffing,\u201d Meshkov said.\n\nIn this technique\u2014which has been used since the internet\u2019s early days\u2013a website or browser extension adds extra information to a user\u2019s cookie so it looks like more people clicked on an affiliate ad than actually did. Cybercriminals use cookie stuffing to win money through ad fraud.By using fake ad blockers, cybercriminals can earn commission on purchases made on sites stuffed with the cookies, Meshkov said.What\u2019s especially difficult in terms of preventing this type of ad fraud is that it\u2019s difficult for users downloading fraudulent adblockers to tell the difference from legitimate ones, he said.The two extensions in question\u2013AdBlock by AdBlock Inc. and uBlock by Charlie Lee\u2014have names similar to existing ad blockers AdBlock by getadblockand uBlock.org\u2019s uBlock or Raymond Hill\u2019s uBlock Origin, Meshkov wrote.Moreover, the fake ad blocker extensions do in fact block ads, he said. They \u201cboth are based on the code of the original \u2018AdBlock\u2019 extension so the quality is good enough,\u201d Meshkov wrote in the post.However, after 55 hours, the extensions act a bit differently than typical ad blockers, serving up commands for the extension to execute that hijack cookies from affiliate programs such as Teamviewer, Meshkov wrote. Then, if the Web user with the fraudulent ad blocker makes a purchase on Teamviewer.com, \u201cthe extensions owner will be paid a commission by Teamviewer,\u201d he wrote.Meshkov found AdBlock and uBlock hijacking cookie commissions from numerous sites, including Microsoft.com, Linkedin.com, Aliexpress.com, and Booking.com.\u201cThe scale is unprecedented,\u201d he wrote \u201cThese two add-ons have more than 1.6 million \u2018weekly active users,\u2019 who were stuffed with cookies of [more] than 300 websites from Alexa Top 10,000. It is difficult to estimate the damage, but I\u2019d say that we are talking about millions of USD monthly.\u201dIt\u2019s not the first time dodgy ad blockers have appeared on the Chrome store. Two years ago Google also had to remove malicious Chrome extensions spoofing AdBlock Plus from the store.Google did not immediately respond to request for comment Tuesday.One \u201cbright side\u201d to the latest discovery is that affiliate programs being defrauded now \u201ccan follow the money trail and find out who is behind this scheme,\u201d Meshkov wrote.There is precedence for criminal prosecution against this type of ad fraud, he added. In 2014 former eBay affiliate marketer Brian Dunning was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison for a $35 million cookie-stuffing scam.Interested in the role of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, for both offense and defense?

        "raw text": "UPDATEAfter discovering a cache of 17 million emails exposed on an unsecured database, researchers with vpnMentor began to hunt for its owner \u2014 but to their surprise, they found that the database belonged not to a company, but to a sophisticated criminal network.Cybercriminals had been both collecting emails \u2014 and creating their own \u2014 that were linked to fake accounts created on Groupon, Ticketmaster and other major online vendors. Utilizing stolen credit cards, cybercriminals opened millions of fake accounts and used them to buy tickets on various ticket vendor sites, and then resell them to others online. The scheme has been ongoing since 2016, until the fraudsters made a fatal flaw \u2014 leaving the emails open to the public on the unsecured database.\u201cSince 2016, they have been using a combination of email, credit-card [fraud] and ticket fraud against Groupon, Ticketmaster and many other vendors,\u201d according to Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, researchers with vpnMentor, in a Wednesday analysis. \u201cGroupon has been trying to shut this operation down ever since it started, but it has proven resilient.\u201dThe enormous database contained 17 million emails and totaled 1.2 terabytes of data. Specific data that was exposed appeared to be personal details of anyone purchasing tickets from a website that was using ticket processing platform Neuroticket, as well as records from coupons, discounts, newsletter and promotional emails, and more. The millions of emails were both generated by the cybercriminals themselves and tied to the fraudulent accounts, but were also collected from corresponding interactions with ticket vendors, such as Groupon, as well as consumers who bought the resold tickets.The majority (90 percent) of the database involved records from popular coupon and discounts website Groupon, totaling 16 million altogether.\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that we do not believe any of the accounts contained in this database were real customers and that no actual customer information was obtained,\u201d a Groupon spokesperson told Threatpost. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for other companies.\u201dThe other 10 percent of the database included records from both small independent venues (such as the Pacific Northwest Ballet, Fox Theatre in Georgia and the Colorado Ballet in Denver) and the internet\u2019s biggest ticket vendors, Ticketmaster and Tickpick.In another twist, researchers also found a ransom note embedded in the database, claiming to have extracted the information and asking for $400 in Bitcoin in return for not releasing the database to the public.\u201cIt seems at least one criminal hacker has already hacked the database. Not understanding what they discovered,\u00a0 they\u2019re trying to extort its owners,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThis is a known issue with many open databases. It is usually triggered by automated scripts and not manually by humans.\u201dWhile initially viewing the database last month, researchers thought that it might be the result of a vulnerability in Neuroticket, the mailing system that was linked to the database.However, upon further investigation, researchers found that certain parts of the database weren\u2019t adding up. For instance, when randomly contacting 10 email addresses on the database, only one person replied back.The researchers said that the database was linked to a number of bot-created accounts discovered and purged by Groupon in 2016.Researchers also said that the criminal operation opened 2 million fraudulent accounts and monitored email inboxes that were linked to the fraudulent accounts and extracted tickets from the emails. They would then resell the tickets to innocent consumers, who sometimes may not be able to use them, due to the transactions being void or tickets being sold to multiple consumers.Groupon for its part argues that the database and the 2016 are not linked, but instead \u201csimilar,\u201d and that the initial number of 2 million fake accounts reported by researchers is not accurate.\u201cThe number was nowhere near 2 million,\u201d the Groupon spokesperson told Threatpost. \u201cIt was less than 5 percent of the total. Also, it would be more accurate to call them fake accounts as we didn\u2019t identify any specific fraud associated with them. Just that they didn\u2019t appear to be human. Further, we have no evidence the accounts in the database and those from 2016 are linked \u2014 just that they are similar.\u201dThe Groupon spokesperson told Threatpost that the maximum number of transactions associated with this database was 673.\u201cGroupon had been able to close most of the accounts, but not all of them,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe operation has remained resilient, despite excellent work by the company. Groupon\u2019s chief information security officer (CISO) estimates the number of fraudulent accounts in the network we helped uncover to be as high as 20,000.\u201dResearchers said that they are working to alert any other parties impacted by the breach, including customers, clients and website users. The database is no longer online.Web Security",

        "raw text": "Federal authorities have arrested 281 people and seized nearly $3.7 million in a coordinated effort between multiple agencies to disrupt a massive email-fraud scheme.Perpetrators of a global business email compromise (BEC) scheme were the target of a four-month investigation that began in May called Operation reWired, a coordinated effort by the U.S. Departments of Justice (DoJ), Homeland Security, Treasury, State and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, working with local and state law-enforcement agencies.In addition to the arrests and millions in repatriations, officials also seized money-mule warning letters and assets for a total of 214 domestic actions in the investigation, according to a DoJ press release.The news comes on the heels of an alert issued by the FBI that organizations have lost $26.2 billion in the last three years to BEC schemes, which defraud victims by using emails to deceive them into sending wire transfers or personal information so cybercriminals can realize financial gain.Operation reWired spanned multiple countries, with 167 arrested in Nigeria, as well as dozens of others the United States, Turkey, Ghana, France, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia and the United Kingdom.In a statement, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray said the indictments send a strong message to criminals who organize these schemes, who typically are foreigners and members of international criminal syndicates originating in Nigeria but with global connections.\u201cWe\u2019ll keep coming after you, no matter where you are,\u201d Wray said.The indictments also demonstrate to the public that the government is significantly invested in tracking down these types of cybercriminals and putting an end to their efforts whenever possible, he said. Wray also encouraged people to report incidents of BEC to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3).BEC, or what the feds also refer to as \u201ccyber-enabled financial fraud,\u201d specifically targets those with access to company finances as well as businesses working with foreign suppliers in sophisticated scams that involve having people make wire transfers\u2014often recurring ones\u2013to accounts where bad actors can access the money. Cybercriminals also use these scams to gain access to the means to make those transfers.Scammers also target and attempt to exploit individual victims such as people buying real estate or the elderly by impersonating a business partner or someone else connected to them and sending an email requesting money. Because the person receiving the email believes the message is from someone they trust, they often are deceived into making a payout.BECs also appear in the form of lottery or romance scams and also can involve bad actors asking for personal information so they themselves can access the victim\u2019s financial accounts.Indeed, BECs are widespread and numerous because they\u2019re a rather low-investment way for cybercriminals to make quite a lot of money, said Kevin Epstein, vice president of threat operation at Proofpoint, in an email to Threatpost.\u201cSending fraudulent email is cheap and the messages don\u2019t require expensive malware or sophisticated command and control; yet the attacks themselves are highly effective, resulting in billions of dollars in reported losses,\u201d he said.Though efforts like Operation reWired are effective, law enforcement shouldn\u2019t shoulder all of the responsibility to thwart BEC attacks, Epstein said. Enterprise and business leaders also have an obligation to help prevent these attacks from within their organizations, he said.\u201cOrganizations need to take immediate steps to significantly reduce the chances that a BEC attack is successful by educating their employees and deploying solutions that place the individual at the center of their security strategy,\u201d Epstein said.GovernmentWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The first half of 2019 saw a 13 percent increase in fraudulent activity compared to the previous six months, with a spike in June representing the highest-volume bot attack that\u2019s been recorded since 2016, according to an analysis from LexisNexis Risk Solutions.The firm\u2019s report, with data gleaned from 277 million human-initiated attacks across its Digital Identity Network, shows that bot attacks focused on new account creations are on the rise, bent on building fake online identities across diverse sectors. This type of attack is the only criminal \u201cuse case\u201d that saw growth in the study period.The June attack targeted a virtual gift-card provider, with a bot trying to set up accounts using different email addresses. LexisNexis found that the attack originated in the U.S., but the browser language was set to Russian.There were also two smaller peaks in attacks in the first six months of 2019; in January, a global e-commerce merchant was the key target for a series of bot attacks coming from the U.S., Chile, Switzerland and Canada. These bots were attempting fraudulent new account creations from desktop devices, using stolen identity credentials. In February, fraudsters used device-spoofing and IP-spoofing to target a multinational bank, with the attacks originating from the U.S.From a trend perspective, different industries are being targeted in different ways, according to the report. Within media, for example, bot attacks targeting new account creations saw a 65 percent increase in just six months, looking to abuse bonus offers. This is where fraudsters attempt to sign up for new accounts to capitalize on free trials and streaming bonuses, which they in turn sell on the black market for profit. E-commerce companies also saw bot attacks on new account creations increase \u2013 to the tune of 305 percent \u2013 and were most prevalent in online marketplaces, virtual gift card companies and ridesharing sites.Mobile fraud is another hotspot (though it lags far behind desktop attacks), as fraudsters look to new mobile account creations and app registrations as opportunities to intercept one-time passcodes to fraudulently register mobile apps, according to LexisNexis. Globally, attacks on mobile apps rose 148 percent in six months.Mobile account creation bots are targeting social media apps to test, validate or build synthetic identities: \u201cThe Digital Identity Network saw hundreds of thousands of bot events from Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand, India, Ukraine and Bangladesh, suggesting stolen/synthetic identity farms may be supporting emerging and growth economies,\u201d according to the report.And, crooks are targeting gaming/gambling organizations, where bad actors register for new player bonuses to sell for profit.Regionally speaking, LexisNexis found that data breaches continue to spur attacks in North America.\u201cIn some cases, identity data may have been stolen several times over, with fraudsters continually validating and building stolen and synthetic identities to improve the success of attacks,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe impact of these breaches is highlighted in the e-commerce new account creation attack rate.\u201dGlobally the attack rate is 30.4 percent, but in North America the attack rate is almost 40 percent. Desktop transactions are by far the biggest target for these attacks, according to the firm, and a large proportion of these new account creations attacks are carried out by automated bots trying to validate, augment or build out identities, or attempting to benefit from new account bonuses or discounts. Meanwhile, the e-commerce payments attack rate from North America is growing at a rate of 52 percent year-on-year compared to 12 percent globally.Interested in more on the internet of things (IoT)?

        "raw text": "More than half of logins (53 percent) on social-media sites are fraudulent; and 25 percent of all new account applications on social media are fake, according to a recent analysis. Those numbers far outstrip the overall rate of 10 percent of interactions being fraudulent.The Arkose Labs Q3 Fraud and Abuse Report found that social-media platforms see a variety of attacks from bots as well as malicious humans, including account takeovers, fraudulent account creation, spam and other abuse. More than three-quarters (75 percent) of attacks on social media are automated bot attacks, according to the analysis.Unlike other industries, account-takeover attacks are more common for social media, with logins twice as likely to be attacked than account registrations. This is driven by the fraudsters looking to harvest rich personal data from the accounts of legitimate users, according to Arkose.\u201cThe extremely high attack rate on social-media logins is indicative of the value placed on the data fraudsters extract from compromised social accounts,\u201d said Kevin Gosschalk, CEO of Arkose, in a media statement. \u201cBecause more than 50 percent of social media logins are fraud, we know that fraudsters are using large-scale bots to launch attacks on social-media platforms with the goal of disseminating spam, stealing information, spreading social propaganda and executing social-engineering campaigns targeting trusting consumers.\u201dFrom an overall digital fraud perspective, Arkose examined more than 1.2 billion transactions spanning account registrations, logins and payments from financial services, e-commerce, travel, social media, gaming and entertainment industries, and found that one in 10 transactions overall are malicious, ranging from automated bots to humans carrying out scams.Bots vs. HumansAutomated attacks represent the bulk of the traffic, according to the report, ranging from large-scale account validation attacks, to bots blocking seats on an airline to scripted attacks that scrape user data and inventory.This varies by geography and industry though: Further analysis found that most attacks from China (59.3 percent) are human-driven, which is more than four times higher than the U.S., Russia, the Philippines, and Indonesia.Unlike bot traffic, inauthentic human traffic is harder to detect as human behavior is unpredictable and highly nuanced.\u201cSometimes fraudsters have to rely on humans to carry out attacks; these attacks cost more, but the value they can extract from the attack makes the investment worthwhile,\u201d said Vanita Pandey, vice president of strategy at Arkose Labs, in a media statement. \u201cDeveloping economies are quickly becoming fraud hubs because they have easy access to sophisticated tools, cheap manual labor and good economic incentives associated with online fraud.\u201dAttacks by IndustryThe report pinpointed some interesting vertical trends: For one, payment transactions in the travel industry are 10 times more likely to be attacked; and, the retail industry experiences the highest volume of human driven attacks, with more than half of attacks being human-driven.The travel industry attacks are mainly coming from automated bots looking to block inventory, leading to denial of inventory attacks or a signi\ufb01cant increases in ticket prices. They\u2019re also looking to steal hard-customer loyalty points, which can be liquidated into cash. Overall, Arkose Labs found that almost 10 percent of all login attempts on travel sites and 46 percent of all payment transactions for travel are fraud.As for retail, the sector is on the cusp of the most-attacked time of the year.\u201cAs we head into the holiday season, this is critical for the retail industry, which sees high volumes of seasonal and human driven fraud,\u201d said Pandey. \u201cRight now, fraudsters are actively preparing to launch large-scale attacks on retail vendors during the holidays by validating and testing stolen gift cards and identities compromised in recent breaches. The long-term solution to this problem is not rooted in applying new defenses \u2014 because fraud will continue to evolve \u2014 but rather to break the economics of the attack and eliminate a fraudster\u2019s financial incentive.\u201dMeanwhile, the technology segment is heavily targeted by human click-farms and sweatshops, which employ a large group of low-paid workers hired speci\ufb01cally to make fraudulent transactions or create fake accounts, the report found. In fact, 43 percent of all attacks on tech companies are human driven and account registrations for tech companies are four times more likely to be attacks than logins.According to the report, the U.S., Russia, the Philippines, the UK and Indonesia have emerged as the top originators of attacks, with the Philippines as the single biggest attack originator for both automated and human-driven attacks. The U.S. is a distant second.Interested in more on the internet of things (IoT)?

        "raw text": "The FBI has taken control of 31 web domains in a widespread takedown of a multi-year, global ad fraud campaign, believed to have stolen at least $38 million, partly via a botnet strategy.In addition, eight defendants face a 13-count indictment from a federal court in Brooklyn in the case. The charges against Aleksandr Zhukov, Boris Timokhin, Mikhail Andreev, Denis Avdeev, Dmitry Novikov, Sergey Ovsyannikov, Aleksandr Isaev and Yevgeniy Timchenko include wire fraud, computer intrusion, aggravated identity theft and money laundering.Ovsyannikov, Zhukov and Timchenko have been arrested and await extradition. The remaining defendants are at large.The court also delivered search warrants authorizing the FBI to take information from 89 computer servers that served as infrastructure for the ad-fraud botnets behind the campaign. And, seizure warrants have been executed for multiple international bank accounts in Switzerland and elsewhere that were associated with the schemes, the court said.\u201cAs alleged in court filings, the defendants in this case used sophisticated computer programming and infrastructure around the world to exploit the digital advertising industry through fraud,\u201d said Richard Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, in a notice\u00a0posted Tuesday. \u201cThis case sends a powerful message that this office, together with our law-enforcement partners, will use all our available resources to target and dismantle these costly schemes and bring their perpetrators to justice, wherever they are.\u201dThe court filings allege that the defendants posed as operators of a legitimate ad network, capable of delivering ad impressions to advertisers coming from live human traffic. In reality, both the webpages and the traffic were fake, according to the court.\u201cThey programmed computers they controlled to load advertisements on fabricated webpages, via an automated program, in order to fraudulently obtain digital advertising revenue,\u201d the documents explained.There were two campaigns involved in the operation. In one, which ran between September 2014 and December 2016, the defendants allegedly rented more than 1,900 computer servers housed in commercial datacenters (mainly in Dallas), and used those datacenter servers to load ads on fabricated websites, ultimately spoofing more than 5,000 domains. The group allegedly falsified billions of ad views and caused businesses to pay more than $7 million for ads that were never actually viewed by real human internet users.\u201cTo create the illusion that real human internet users were viewing the advertisements loaded onto these fabricated websites, the defendants programmed the datacenter servers to simulate the internet activity of human internet users: browsing the internet through a fake browser, using a fake mouse to move around and scroll down a webpage, starting and stopping a video player midway, and falsely appearing to be signed into Facebook,\u201d the court documents explained.The defendants also allegedly leased more than 650,000 IP addresses, assigned multiple IP addresses to each datacenter server, and then fraudulently registered those IP addresses to make it appear that that the datacenter servers were residential computers belonging to individual human internet users who were subscribed to various residential ISPs.Running parallel, between December 2015 and October 2018, the group carried out another digital ad fraud scheme, where a botnet network of more than 1.7 million malware-infected computers was used to download fabricated webpages and load ads onto them. In all, this effort \u2013 which made use of the Kovter malware, according to the court \u2013 allegedly falsified billions of ad views and caused businesses to pay more than $29 million for ads that were never actually viewed by humans.\u201cWhile a lot of attention has been paid to the use of botnets \u2026 the most damning feature of these operations were the various malicious code that was deployed to infect computers, redirect traffic, etc.,\u201d said Mike Bittner, digital security and operations manager of The Media Trust, in an emailed statement. \u201cThe malware, which would check for user names, IP addresses, certain ISPs and geographical locations, as well as for any security software, is part of a new generation of malware designed to refrain from execution unless the right conditions are met. Not only does this capability enable the malware to escape detection, it also opens up victims\u2019 machines and devices to later attacks.\u201cThis underscores the importance of knowing who you do business with along the digital ad supply chain and of collaborating with them on identifying the underlying malicious code, which wreaks havoc on unknowing users and undermines the supply chain,\u201d said Bittner. \u201cPublishers and e-commerce sites that want to protect their digital assets and users from such campaigns should closely monitor all code that courses through their digital ecosystem, through continuous and real-time scanning; ensure all of them are authorized; and if not, work with their digital partners and third parties on terminating them at their source. At the end of the day, the malicious code is the real weapon and it can be stopped in its tracks.\u201dAd fraud seems to be a theme this week: The news comes on the heels of Cheetah Mobile landing in the headlines for allegedly perpetrating ad fraud of its own.GovernmentMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A new hacker forum is taking a unique political stance to support Ukraine in its war with Russia, entertaining only topics and threat activity focused against Russia and Belarus, researchers have found.The Russian-language site, DUMPS Forum, has been around since late May, and at first glance seemed like \u201cevery other run-of-the-mill Russian language cybercriminal forum,\u201d researchers from the Photon Research Team of Digital Shadows, a ReliaQuest Company, said in a blog post published Wednesday.The forum\u2014which currently has about 100 members\u2013has sections for trading illicit material, carding, malware, and establishing accesses to targeted networks, with an open invite for anyone to join.A closer look at the forum revealed its unique ideology to take a firm political stance to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia\u2019s invasion, \u201cthe only forum we\u2019re aware of that is taking such a stance,\u201d researchers wrote.While most of the specific activity sections remained empty at the time researchers viewed the forum, the section most populated so far was the one focused on leaks, researchers noted. Users already have shared data stolen from Russia-based government and private institutions, including several well known and important government entities as well as utilities providers, they said.Indeed, much of the activity currently discussed on the site is geared toward sharing data leaks, researchers observed. Other top topics advertise DDoS attack services, forged and stolen identity documents, and anonymous and bulletproof hosting services, with all cybercriminal activity aimed against targets in Russia and Belarus.Unabashed Support for UkraineIts pro-Ukrainian stance puts DUMPS Forum in a unique position, but also points a target on its back, researchers said. \u201cIf the forum develops into a well-known and successful project, it will likely become a target of counter activity from Russia-supporting cyber criminals,\u201d they said.As Ukraine has been pummeled by attackers in a cyber war that\u2019s raged alongside the land invasion by Russia, however, it seems only fair that someone takes up the side of the Ukrainians in cyber space. Russian-based hackers hit Ukrainian cyber targets even before the physical invasion, an assault that has continued during the ground conflict, which is in its sixth month.DUMPS takes a \u201cbrazen\u201d position to support Ukraine, even going so far as to posting its physical location, which points to a residential apartment in Kyiv in a building with a roof that contains a vulgar insult in Russian towards Vladimir Putin, researchers said.\u201cWe\u2019ve no idea if this location is actually the admin\u2019s home; however it emphasizes the spirit of defiance and resistance in which the forum is built,\u201d they observed.Top Services Offered Of the specific services being hawked on the site, DDoS attacks seem likely to be among those that will gain the most traction, researchers noted. This is because \u201cDDoS attacks and defacement activity have returned in a major way since the onset of the war,\u201d they said. These attacks largely have come from an army of hacktivist actors operating on behalf of both sides.The specific DDoS services advertised on the site allow users to order DDoS attacks on any network resource \u201cquickly, qualitatively, effectively,\u201d with a power range of up to 500 gbps, priced at $80 an hour. Layer 4 attacks are priced at $500 for 24 hours, while Layer 7 attacks priced at $600 for the same amount of time, researchers said.A forum post already confirmed successful defacement activity directed against the Russian state website of the Ministry of Construction, Housing and Communal Services of the Russian Federation, they added.The forum also has a distinct focus on advertising information services\u2014also known as probiv\u2014which is a type of quid-pro-quo service in which a user provides a piece of personal data belonging to an individual and, in return for a fee, receives other information associated with this target.The probiv services on the forum are primarily directed against Russian and Belarussian government agencies, financial institutions and mobile network carriers, researchers said. Information of interest includes: Russian passport details, data from local wanted lists and criminal records, data regarding suspects or persons of interests, migrant information, information related to buying tickets for transportation out of Russia, or lists of citizens convicted of possessing illegal weapons.A Look AheadGoing forward, the site could potentially play a major role in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia \u201cas a hub for hacktivists and patriotic cyber threat actors, as a symbol of resistance, and making a demonstrable difference on the cyber battlefield,\u201d researchers noted.However, its choice to operate with content almost exclusively written in Russia is a curious one and could pose a potential challenge, as non-Russian speaking entities who want to join in the cause for Ukraine will be excluded from the forum, researchers noted.On the other hand, it suggests that the forum\u2019s goal is to target members within the Russian federation who can mount attacks from within the country and who likely wouldn\u2019t speak Ukrainian; while most Ukrainians speak Russian fluently and would also be able to participate, they said.The forum\u2019s current open nature that allows anyone to join could also represent an operational security risk, with some users requesting an invite-only system to protect users from potential retaliation from pro-Russia entities, researchers said.HacksNews",

        "raw text": "The U.S. government ordered two travel companies to provide information about the movement of a Russian citizen suspected of hacking. The surveillance data was used as part of an investigation by the U.S. Secret Service, according to court documents recently unsealed.The revelation of the extent of surveillance that the feds ordered companies to do in a 2015 investigation of Russian hacker Aleksei Burkov once again raises questions of privacy, accountability and responsibility in terms of how much access the government should have to an individual\u2019s private data.A letter from Forbes prompted the unsealing of court documents in the case Burkov, a now-infamous cybercriminal who at the time of the investigation was suspected of facilitating the theft of $20 million from stolen credit cards on a website called Cardplanet that he was running on the dark web.The feds arrested Burkov at Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv in December 2015, and he eventually was extradited to the U.S. in 2019. In January 2020, he pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud, identity theft, computer intrusions, wire fraud and money laundering.Burkov eventually was sentenced to nine years in a federal prison, but mysteriously sent back to Russia in September 2021 for reasons which are still unclear, according to Forbes.Forbes submitted a legal challenge to unseal documents in the case, which it won, subsequently publishing a report this week on what those documents revealed: extensive surveillance of Burkov by two travel companies, U.S.-based Sabre and U.K.-based Travelport, at the behest of the feds. The government used this data to track Burkov\u2019s movements which eventually led to his arrest and prosecution.Tracking Burkov\u2019s MovementThe court documents show that in November 2015, a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted a request by the U.S. government and ordered Sabre and Travelport to provide \u201call records, services and usages\u201d of Burkov for a two-year period following the issuing of the order. The companies also had to provide a \u201creal time\u201d report on a weekly basis of\u00a0 Burkov\u2019s account activity to the feds.The order was granted under the All Writs Act, a broad, 233-year-old law that allows for the government to \u201cissue all writs necessary and appropriate\u201d to aid authorities in their quest for the \u201cproper administration of justice.\u201dThe act is open to interpretation and has already been used a number of times by the U.S. government as a means of forcing tech companies into giving up information to aid them in investigations\u2014a situation the American Civil Liberties Union deems \u201cimproper use.\u201dIndeed, the act has most often been used against tech giants Google and Apple to force them to help the federal government unlock Android devices or iPhones of suspects in criminal cases.The most high-profile of these cases came after a 2015 mass shooting in San Bernadino, Calif., when Apple held its ground in its refusal to unlock the iPhone of shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. Eventually, the case came to end when the FBI managed to unlock the device without Apple\u2019s help.Privacy Issues or Just Cause?While privacy advocates believe the federal use of the courts to force tech companies to give up data that customers shared with them in privacy is an overreach, security professionals for the most part support the action in the case of criminal investigations\u2014to a point.The monitoring of Burkov\u2019s movement to apprehend him was justified due to the criminal nature of his activity, one security professional told Threatpost.\u201cAfter\u00a0reviewing the facts of the case, a federal judge agreed there was enough cause and issued a ruling that authorized this activity,\u201d Rosa Smothers, a former CIA cyber threat analyst and technical intelligence officer and current senior vice president at security firm KnowBe4, wrote in an email to Threatpost. \u201cThis was not a case of rogue government officials conducting unapproved data collection.\u201dAnother security professional said that he\u2019s not overly concerned if the federal government uses legal means to get access to private data collected by technology companies. However, it\u2019s not always clear who has access to the \u201cmassive troves of data\u201d being collected by companies like Meta and Google, observed John Bambenek, Principal Threat Hunter at security and operations analytics company Netenrich, in an email to Threatpost. This, he said, is concerning and should be remedied.\u201cWhether its Meta saying they can\u2019t figure out where personal data is being used inside Meta, or law enforcement being able to get real time information on suspects, society just hasn\u2019t come to grips with the implications of surveillance capitalism,\u201d he said.GovernmentPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Researchers have found financial and technological links between the Karakurt cybercriminal group and two high-profile ransomware actors that signal a shift in business operations and an expansion of opportunities for the threat actors to target victims, they said.Karakurt\u2014a financially motivated threat actor first identified last summer\u2014now appears to be entangled with both the Conti and Diavol groups, researchers from Tetra Defense, an Artic Wolf company, and Chainalysis revealed in a report published Friday.Researchers used forensics-based threat intel and blockchain analysis in its discovery that the two ransomware groups\u2014which were believed to be operating independently\u2014have now become part of the evolving Karakurt web, they said. The ties between Karakurt and Conti especially appear to be strong, with the former working off the latter\u2019s resources, they said.\n\u201cWhether Karakurt is an elaborate side hustle by Conti and Diavol operatives or whether this is an enterprise sanctioned by the overall organization remains to be seen,\u201d researchers said. \u201cWhat we can say is this connection perhaps explains why Karakurt is surviving and thriving despite some of its exfiltration-only competitors dying out.\u201dWidening the WebThe findings are significant for a number of reasons. One is that the links appear to show Karakurt embracing ransomware, which did not appear to be the case when it was first identified last year.The group\u2014which takes its name from a venomous spider commonly found in eastern Europe and Siberia\u2014initially demonstrated sole interest in data exfiltration and subsequent extortion rather than ransomware, which allowed it to move quickly. In fact, Karakurt already had amassed 40 victims, 95 percent of which were in North America and the rest in Europe, in its first few months of operation.With links to ransomware groups, Karakurt clearly is expanding its horizons, researchers said. However, the move appears to be benefitting Conti just as much, representing a shift in that group\u2019s tactics as well, researchers said.Conti previously operated on a \u201cstandard pledge\u201d to victims that if they pay a ransom to the group, they will not be targeted in future attacks, according to the report. However, Tetra Defense initially discovered the link between Karakurt and Conti at a client who claimed to have been hit with another extortion attempt after already falling victim to Conti and paying the ransom demand.That second attempt was from an unknown group that stole data but did not use encryption to do so\u2014the modus operandi of Karakurt, researchers found. Moreover, Karakurt does not seem to delete the data it steals, which also seems to renege on Conti\u2019s promise to victims, they said.Coincidentally, that particular client incident occurred during a tough time for Conti, who was grappling with disgruntled affiliates who wanted to be paid more, one of whom turned on the group by leaking Conti\u2019s playbook and training materials. Researchers surmised that linking up would have been a mutually-beneficial scenario for both cybercriminal groups, and found financial, technological and other evidence of the connection.Proof of ConnectionsOn the technological side, researchers observed similarities between Karakurt and Conti by creating a dataset of Karakurt intrusions, of which they\u2019ve already observed more than a dozen, they said.\u201cWhile Karakurt attacks can vary with respect to tools, some notable overlaps began to emerge between some Karakurt intrusions and the earlier suspected Conti-related re-extortion,\u201d researchers wrote.These included the use of Fortinet SSL VPNs for the initial point of intrusion; the use of the same tools for exfiltration; \u201ca unique adversary choice\u201d to create and leave behind a file listing of exfiltrated data named \u201cfile-tree.txt\u201d in the victim\u2019s environment; and the repeated use of the same attacker hostname when remotely accessing victims\u2019 networks, they wrote.Tetra researchers also worked with Chainalysis and its blockchain analysis team, to analyze cryptocurrency transactions carried out by Conti and Karakurt, which revealed financial connections between the two, they said.\u201cBlockchain analysis provided some of the earliest indication of Karakurt\u2019s ties to Conti ransomware, as the relevant transactions pre-date the discovery of the similarities in Karakurt and Conti\u2019s software and attack strategy,\u201d they said.Specifically, Chainalysis identified dozens of cryptocurrency addresses belonging to Karakurt, scattered across multiple wallets with victim payments ranging from $45,000 to $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.In their analysis, researchers quickly observed Karakurt wallets sending significant amounts of cryptocurrency to Conti wallets\u2014in one instance, for example, Karakurt\u2019s extortion wallet moved 11.36 Bitcoin, or about $472,000 at the time of transfer, to a Conti wallet, they said.Chainalysis also discovered shared wallet hosting between both Conti and Karakurt victim payment addresses, leaving \u201cvirtually no doubt that Conti and Karakurt are deployed by the same individual or group,\u201d researchers noted.Link to DiavolTetra researchers also observed the use of shared tools and infrastructure between Karakurt and Diavol ransomware group, with also has been associated with the dangerous and widely used trojan TrickBot.Specifically, leaks from Jabber chats between February and March of this year confirmed that Karakurt and Diavol operators were sharing attacker infrastructure during the same period of time, researchers said.Further, blockchain analysis also confirmed Diavol\u2019s connection to Karakurt and Conti, showing that Diavol and Karakurt extortion addresses are being hosted by the Conti wallet, they said.\u201cAgain, this common address ownership confirms with near total certainty that Diavol is deployed by the same actors behind Conti and Karakurt,\u201d researchers wrote.Moving to the cloud?

Paul Nakasone, who heads up Cyber Command, told the New York Times this weekend that his team isn\u2019t just going after state actors, but that they\u2019re taking on any cybercriminals who attack American infrastructure.\u201cBefore, during and since, with a number of elements of our government, we have taken actions and we have imposed costs,\u201d Nakasone said in the New York Times, according to CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s an important piece that we should always be mindful of.\u201dWe want to know what your biggest cloud security concerns and challenges are, and how your company is dealing with them. Weigh in with our exclusive, anonymous\u00a0Threatpost Poll!Law enforcement has had a few successes taking down malware operator groups like TrickBot and REvil, and taking down DarkSide\u2018s servers following its attack on the Colonial Pipeline, but the rise in cybercrime across almost every sector is undeniable.Now the feds have called in the military.Cyber Command\u2019s public entry into the fray presents a whole new set of challenges for cybercriminals who previously enjoyed legal protections from law enforcement in their own countries and found sanction workarounds, Max Galka, CEO of Elementus explained to Threatpost.\u201cDirect involvement by the military is quite a shift,\u201d Galka said. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate that the U.S military has stepped in. As a result of U.S. intervention over the last one or two years, a number of ransomware operators have responded by disappearing from the scene and offering in some cases free decryption tools to undo the damage.\u201dThat itself proves the threat of consequence for cybercrime works.\u201cI expect this latest escalation will result in some of them retreating from the scene,\u201d Galka added.More Consequences, Fewer Cyberattacks If the threat of being targeted by Cyber Command is scary enough to drive a few attackers out of business, that\u2019s good news for the private sector, according to Rick Holland, vice president of Digital Shadows, which could use a bit of help under the weight of crushing cyberthreats to their organizations.\u201cSanctions and FBI attempts to recover extortion payments can\u2019t be done in isolation,\u201d Holland told Threatpost. \u201cNotification and recovery activities can\u2019t be the only answer to minimizing extortion risks. Prevention, detection, response and recovery must work hand-in-hand.\u201dThe military\u2019s involvement in national security issues makes sense, but BreachQuest\u2019s chief technology officer Jake Williams told Threatpost that the private sector should be mindful of overreach.\u201cGiven the rich history of separation between military and law enforcement in the U.S., this should be viewed with extreme caution,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen cybercrime intersects with national-security concerns, military response is likely appropriate. However, we should be cautious about military involvement in the majority of cybercrime operations, whether from an investigative or response standpoint.\u201dThere\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.\u00a0REGISTER TODAY\u00a0to learn key concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and how to use it to navigate the data ocean and add context to cybersecurity threats (without being an expert!).

        "raw text": "The St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper recently found a huge security blunder: The Missouri educational agency\u2019s site was displaying 100,000+ clearly visible Social-Security numbers for school teachers, administrators and counselors in its HTML source code.The newspaper verified its findings with a cybersecurity professor and then informed the agency responsible for the leaking site \u2013 the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) \u2013 on Tuesday. On the same day, the DESE took down the affected pages. Then, on Wednesday, having waited to disclose the vulnerability until after the pages came down, the outlet published its story.The next day, on Thursday morning, a naked emperor shot the messenger, as Missouri Gov. Mike Parson threatened legal action against whoever found the vulnerability and whoever may have helped them.Through a multi-step process, an individual took the records of at least three educators, decoded the HTML source code, and viewed the SSN of those specific educators.We notified the Cole County prosecutor and the Highway Patrol\u2019s Digital Forensic Unit will investigate. pic.twitter.com/2hkZNI1wXE\u2014 Governor Mike Parson (@GovParsonMO) October 14, 2021He called the unnamed journalist a \u201chacker,\u201d vowed to sic the courts on the individual and said the state would try to recoup incident-response costs that might cost taxpayers \u201cas much as $50 million.\u201dA Quick Tutorial in How to Become a Source-Code-Sniffing \u2018Hacker\u2019\u201cThrough a multistep process,\u201d Parson gravely said, \u201can individual took the records of at least three educators, decoded the HTML source code and viewed the Social-Security numbers of those specific educators.\u201dThat surely sounds nefarious to those who aren\u2019t familiar with how the magic of the internet works, but the truth is that HTML source code is only \u201cencoded\u201d as it travels from a website to a browser, which automatically \u201cdecodes\u201d the HTML because that\u2019s what browsers do: They interpret HTML instructions.Jake Williams, co-founder and CTO at incident-response provider BreachQuest, told Threatpost on Friday that the journalist\u2019s means of discovering the flaw \u201cis certainly not hacking in any sense of the word.\u201dHe continued: \u201cIt appears that the reporter used a publicly available web application intended to facilitate searching for teacher certifications. When the results were displayed, the reporter simply viewed the source code of the web page and found the social security numbers. While Governor Parson said the reporter \u2018decoded the HTML source code\u2019 in reality they simply used the feature built into every web browser since the dawn of the internet.\u201dWilliams explained that because HTTP is stateless, many web applications store their status in hidden form fields so they can be passed from the browser back to the server with every request. \u201cIt seems likely that these hidden form fields included the Social-Security number of the teacher,\u201d he suggested.The Post-Dispatch reported that it had found the Social-Security numbers in the HTML source code of the website\u2019s pages, exposed due to a vulnerability in a web app that allowed the public to search teacher certifications and credentials. No other private information was clearly visible.That means that it was publicly available to anyone with a web browser who decided to examine the site\u2019s public code.As Williams suggested, doing so is simple as pie. Every major browser allows you to view HTML source code of any web page by using the browser\u2019s developer tools. For example, in Chrome, to view a page\u2019s source code, choose the three dots in the upper right, select More Tools, then click on Developer Tools, as depicted below.Developer tools in Chrome.Even easier is to press Ctrl+U on your keyboard or Opt+Command+U on a Mac keyboard. Presto: A page\u2019s source code is displayed. An example of what source code looks like for those who\u2019ve never scrutinized this easily accessed data is given below:A website\u2019s source code.Verifying What They SawThe Post-Dispatch reached out to Shaji Khan, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, to verify what it had found. He confirmed that it was \u201ca serious flaw\u201d and that it was \u201cmind-boggling\u201d to find this type of vulnerability in the DESE web app.The professor urged the state to audit its apps to ensure that similar vulnerabilities get weeded out. DESE reportedly kicked off an audit on Tuesday that was still ongoing as of Wednesday but hadn\u2019t yet uncovered other instances of the flaw.At any rate, it\u2019s not the first entity to commit source-code sins. For example, in 2019, data scientist David Stier reported that for months, the source code for Instagram\u2019s website was showing some user profiles that displayed phone numbers and emails: data that wasn\u2019t available on public-facing pages.It\u2019s not clear how long the Social-Security numbers were accessible on DESE\u2019s site, nor if the data was accessed by anyone with ill intent.An \u2018Attempt to Embarrass the State and Sell Headlines\u2019Regardless of how easy it reportedly was to get at the sensitive information, the Post-Dispatch journalist who discovered it was denounced as a criminal \u201chacker,\u201d first in a statement issued by the educational agency and then by the governor.\u201cNothing on DESE\u2019s [the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education\u2019s] website gave permission or authorization for this individual to access teacher data,\u201d the governor claimed during his Thursday press briefing, suggesting that the journalist just wanted to \u201csell headlines.\u201d\u201cThis individual is not a victim,\u201d Parson proclaimed. \u201cThey were acting against the state agency to compromise teachers\u2019 personal information in an attempt to embarrass the state and sell headlines for the news outlet. We will not let this crime against Missouri teachers go unpunished. And we refuse to let them be a pawn in the news outlets\u2019 political vendetta.\u201dParson added that his administration \u201cis standing up against any and all perpetrators who attempt to steal personal information and harm Missourians. It is unlawful to access encoded data and systems in order to examine other peoples\u2019 personal information.\u201dThe governor notified the Cole County Prosecutor about the matter, along with the Missouri State Highway Patrol\u2019s digital forensic unit, which he said will also be conducting \u201can investigation of all of those involved.\u201dBelow is the governor\u2019s full press conference.How About Focusing on the Flaw Instead of Lashing Out?Tim Wade, technical director and CTO team at AI cybersecurity company Vectra, said that the brouhaha underscores the need to protect security researchers who operate in the public good. He suggested that a wise path would be to redirect the spleen that\u2019s directed toward bug-finders and to instead focus that energy on \u201cthe root causes of why these security failures continue to occur.\u201dLegally, he just doesn\u2019t see merit in the saber-rattling. \u201cCourts recognize limits to protections from unlawful search when activities occur clearly in a public context,\u201d Wade observed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that the low technical sophistication of the behaviors described, with a tool as common as a web browser, constitutes anything but the digital equivalent of observations made in a public context.\u201dOther security practitioners agreed. Williams said that rather than focus on this so-called \u201chacking,\u201d Parson \u201cshould be worried about the security of the state\u2019s applications, particularly those that are available for public use.\u201dFrankly, the state should be embarrassed to find a flaw like this in 2021, Williams said. But it\u2019s not the first time that \u201ca politician has fired on all cylinders, claiming that accessing publicly available information was hacking,\u201d he noted, referring to a 2017 incident in which then-Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp alleged that voter records taken from an open directory on a Kennesaw State web server also constituted \u201chacking.\u201d\u201cThat hasn\u2019t exactly aged well, and no charges were ever filed,\u201d Williams said via email.Just Put on Some Pants AlreadyBut hey, it\u2019s all true to form for politicians, as pointed out by John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at digital IT and security operations firm Netenrich. \u201cThroughout human history, emperors have responded to those telling them they were wearing no clothes by lashing out in anger at the audacity of those who\u2019d dare say such a thing,\u201d he told Threatpost.\u201cLife would be better if they, you know, just put on pants,\u201d Bambenek said. \u201cGovernment leaders should be thanking people who notify government of problems, not threatening them. I\u2019m sure every actual criminal hacker on the planet noticed this tirade and you can bet they\u2019re adjusting their targeting accordingly.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentPrivacyVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The U.S. National Security Agency is offering advice to security teams looking for wireless best practices to protect corporate networks and personal devices. The recommendations, while pedestrian in scope, do offer system administrators a solid cheat sheet to share with their work-from-home crowd and mobile workforces.For starters the NSA, in a public service announcement posted on Thursday (PDF), urged\u00a0security teams to be mindful of the wireless threats employees face when using Wi-Fi networks. It also lumps Bluetooth technology and Near Field Communications (NFC) into its list of worrisome protocols.By now, caf\u00e9-based workers have likely mastered both public bathroom and Wi-Fi hotspot hygiene. But, for anyone who hasn\u2019t the NSA advises: \u201cData sent over public Wi-Fi\u2014especially open public Wi-Fi that does not require a password to access\u2014 is vulnerable to theft or manipulation.\u201dAdvice also includes warnings of fake access points that can vacuum up user credentials and skim other personal data retrieved on the \u201cevil twin\u201d access points.NSA Warns of BluetoothMore interestingly, the agency cites Bluetooth as a convenient protocol for private use, but when used in public settings it can be a nasty security liability. The NSA advises turning off Bluetooth in public, lest a user be open to a range of attacks such as BlueBorne or BlueBugging \u2013 both used to access and exfiltrate corporate data on targeted devices.Just last May, security researcher Fabian Braunlein with Positive Security identified Apple\u2019s Send My Bluetooth exploit which allowed data to be exfiltrated from a device to an attacker-controlled Apple iCloud server.Worrisome NFC The NSA also touched on Near Field Communications (NFC), a handy tool for contactless payments. It said data transfer between devices using NFC can be a cybersecurity minefield of pitfalls. With just a tap data, is moved across a radio network from one device to another.Andy Norton a cyber-risk officer with Armis told Threatpost security teams are lagging behind when it comes to securing NFC communications.\u201cRadio connected devices represents a huge risk blind spot for organizations,\u201d Norton said. \u201cThese are very much the soft underbelly of information security controls \u2013\u2013 the majority of energy, focus, and money from a cyber resilience perspective is spent on preventing attacks coming through the internet connected attack surface. Very little is being done to access the risk from near field radio connections.\u201dHe added on just about every job his team finds a \u201crogue antenna device and shadow IT activity from antenna-enabled IoT devices.\u201dIn its security bulletin, the NSA suggests:Disable NFC feature when not needed (if possible).Do not bring devices near other unknown electronic devices. (This can trigger automatic communication.)Do not use NFC to communicate passwords or sensitive data.\u201cUsers should consider additional security measures, including limiting/disabling device location features, using strong device passwords, and only using trusted device accessories, such as original charging cords,\u201d said the NSA.User Behavior Biggest Cybersecurity ChallengeThe NSA\u2019s wireless warnings, while basic, still go unheeded by too many. Sadly, the practical and basic advice still needs promoted, experts said.\u201cMy fear is that the don\u2019ts are ingrained, existing behaviors that are not easy to change and at times unavoidable,\u201d Setu Kulkarni with NTT Application Security said. \u201cFor example, while it is easy to say \u2018Do not bring devices near other unknown electronic devices,\u2019 is that practical?\u201dKulkarni added in an ideal world one key employee cybersecurity rule companies should have in place is keeping personal stuff of their business devices. Enforcing compliance gets much trickier.\u201cThese tips are as relevant in 2021 as they were in 2015, but with the shift to more remote work, there are more people using public Wi-Fi,\u201d said Tim Erlin with Tripwire. \u201cWhile these tips are useful, it can be hard for the average user to understand how to implement them. There\u2019s really a substantial amount of work here for the average user to comply with the recommended settings.\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from? We\u2019ve got your back.

        "raw text": "A Moroccan man suspected of being \u201cDr HeX\u201d \u2013 the prolific threat actor behind a nine-year cyber-blitz on thousands of victims through phishing, website defacing, malware development, fraud and carding \u2013 has been arrested.Interpol announced the bust \u2013 which took place in Morocco in May \u2013 on Tuesday, describing it as the result of a joint two-year probe dubbed Operation Lyrebird that saw Interpol working closely with the Moroccan police and security firm Group-IB.The unnamed suspect allegedly helped to develop carding and phishing kits to sell on criminal online forums. One example of a carding site is Joker\u2019s Stash, which was taken down in December. It was a popular cybercriminal destination that specialized in trading in payment-card data, offering millions of stolen credit and debit cards to buyers.As described in Interpol\u2019s announcement, the buyers of Dr HeX\u2019s carding and phishing kits used them to masquerade as online-banking facilities, allowing the suspect and others \u201cto steal sensitive information and defraud trusting individuals for financial gain, with the losses of individuals and companies published online in order to advertise these malicious services.\u201dWe saw one such example of how the carding economy works in October, when Dallas-based smoked-meat franchise Dickey\u2019s Barbecue Pit saw 3 million customer payment cards turn up on the site. Anyone purchasing the information could create cloned cards to physically use at ATMs or at in-store machines that aren\u2019t chip-enabled; or, they can simply use the information to buy things online.According to a writeup from Group-IB, the suspect was allegedly involved in attacks on 134 websites over the course of nine years, from 2009-2018, leaving his signature \u201cDr HeX\u201d nickname on the attacked web pages. Dr HeX was just one of the nicknames the suspect allegedly used, but that\u2019s the one that the security firm chose to dub the threat actor whom they tracked.Squeezing an Identity Out of a Phishing KitThe starting point for Group-IB researchers\u2019 quest to track down and to unmask Dr HeX was the extraction of a phishing kit, which is a tool used to create phishing web pages. That phishing kit was being used to exploit the brand of a large French bank, according to their writeup.The phishing kit used a typical setup, they described: It included \u201cthe creation of a spoofed website of a targeted company, the mass distribution of emails impersonating it and asking users to enter login information on the spoofed site. The credentials left by unsuspecting victims on the fake page were then redirected to the perpetrator\u2019s email.\u201dAlmost all of the scripts contained in the phishing kit were signed with the signature of their creator, Dr HeX, and had a contact email address.Dr HeX liked that nickname quite a bit: Group-IB researchers found that the alleged attacker\u2019s YouTube channel was signed under that same name. In one of the YouTube videos on his channel, the attacker also left a link leading to an Arabic crowdfunding platform. That gave Group-IB researchers another hook up to the alleged cybercriminal.The name was also used to register \u201cat least\u201d two domains that were created with the email found in the phishing kit, Group-IB said.Based on the email address from the phishing kit, researchers identified other elements of the threat actor\u2019s malicious infrastructure; five email addresses were associated with the suspect; a total of six nicknames; and then there were his accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Skype and YouTube.Between 2009 and 2018, analysts found that Dr HeX defaced over 130 web pages. They also discovered the cybercriminal\u2019s posts \u201con several popular underground platforms intended for malware trading that indicate the latter\u2019s involvement in malware development,\u201d according to Group-IB. Analysts also found evidence that might link Dr HeX to attacks on \u201cseveral huge French corporations\u201d with the aim of \u201cstealing customer\u2019s bank-card data.\u201dGroup-IB\u2019s post quoted Stephen Kavanagh, Interpol executive director of police services, who called Operation Lyrebird \u201ca significant success against a suspect who is accused of targeting unsuspecting individuals and companies across multiple regions for years.\u201d\u201cThe case highlights the threat posed by cybercrime worldwide,\u201d Kavanagh continued. \u201cThe arrest of this suspect is down to outstanding international investigative work and new ways of collaboration, both with Moroccan police and our vital private sector partners such as Group-IB.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Clubhouse, the startup invitation-only chat app, is the latest social-media platform to see mammoth troves of user data collected and posted in underground forums. An SQL file containing the personal data of 1.3 million Clubhouse users has been posted in a hacker forum for free.Names, user IDs, photo URL, number of followers, Twitter and Instagram handles, dates that accounts were created and even the profile information of who invited them to the app are among the information contained in the database, according to CyberNews, giving threat actors key information which can be used against victims in phishing and other socially engineered scams.For its part, Clubhouse said that its users\u2019 data being public isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s just how the platform is built:This is misleading and false. Clubhouse has not been breached or hacked. The data referred to is all public profile information from our app, which anyone can access via the app or our API. https://t.co/I1OfPyc0Bo\u2014 Clubhouse (@joinClubhouse) April 11, 2021The company isn\u2019t supplying any other details and Clubhouse didn\u2019t respond to Threatpost\u2019s request for additional comment.Clubhouse followers on Twitter were quick to note the statement points out a difference without any distinction to its exposed users.\u201cI fail to see what is false \u2026 \u201d user Benjamin Maynard responded to the Clubhouse statement.Leaky APIs Plague Social Media Clubhouse\u2019s terms of service prohibit data scraping, yet its API, by its own admission, is sitting online with no protection against it.\u201cClubhouse has conflicting user policies \u2013 being an invite-only platform and at the same time free-for-all user data,\u201d Setu Kulkarni, vice president with WhiteHat Security said. \u201cAll it takes is one user to figure out the API for such large data egress of the millions of users on the platform.\u201dKulkani added that these platforms need to shift to an API-first security strategy.\u201cTesting APIs in production is as if not more important than ever for not just vulnerabilities but also for business logic flaws that can result in unfettered access to user data,\u201d he said.The Clubhouse database. Click to enlarge. Source: CyberNews.CyberNews researcher Mantas Sasnauskas analyzed the Clubhouse data and said the privacy bug is built into the platform itself.\u201cThe way the Clubhouse app is built lets anyone with a token, or via an API, to query the entire body of public Clubhouse user profile information, and it seems that token does not expire,\u201d Sasnauskas said.The CyberNews team added that the SQL file posted in the hacker forum only has Clubhouse-related information and doesn\u2019t include \u201csensitive data like credit-card details or legal documents.\u201dDenying the ProblemIn the past two weeks, 533 million Facebook users\u2019 data was leaked, LinkedIn saw scraping of 500 million people\u2019s data and now Clubhouse has given up the information on another 1.3 million people.And as Politico Europe\u2019s Nicholas Vinocur pointed out, they\u2019ve all followed an eerily similar disclosure playbook: deny it ever happened.In past ten days:533 million people\u2019s data leaked at Facebook.500 million people\u2019s data leaked at LinkedIn.1.3 million people\u2019s data leaked at Clubhouse.All deny the data was leaked or there was a problem of any sort.\u2014 Nicholas Vinocur (@NicholasVinocur) April 12, 2021Facebook was similarly vulnerable through their API, which Michael Isbitski from Salt Security told Threatpost is becoming more common.\u201cContent scraping is a common attack pattern,\u201d Isbitski said in the wake of the Facebook leak. \u201cOrganizations often build or integrate APIs, without fully considering the abuse cases of the APIs.\u201dLinkedIn also out a statement in the wake of its incident, explaining the platform wasn\u2019t technically \u201cbreached,\u201d but that the information was public and scraped from the LinkedIn site.To view the LinkedIn user data file in the hacker forum, it costs $2 worth of forum credits. The full database was up for auction in the four-figures range.\u201cWe have investigated an alleged set of LinkedIn data that has been posted for sale and have determined that it is actually an aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies\u201d that includes \u201cpublicly viewable member-profile data that appears to have been scraped from LinkedIn,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cThis was not a LinkedIn data breach, and no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in what we\u2019ve been able to review.\u201dData Scraping Fallout \u201cI don\u2019t expect that this will be the last of these sort of scraping incidents,\u201d Isbitski predicted. \u201cAPIs are regularly the vehicle for functionality and data. Social media companies inherently design their platforms to be consumable, powering much of it with APIs. Attackers know this, and they continue to target APIs in scraping attacks, repurposing publicly available data for malicious purposes\u201dUsers of all three of these social media platforms should be aware they could be targeted by email phishing campaigns, so strong passwords and multi-factor authentication are important. CyberNews offers a personal data leak checker to help users figure out if their data was compromised.Ever wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums?

        "raw text": "Chinese-language APTs are targeting telecom companies in cyberespionage campaigns aimed at stealing sensitive data and trade secrets tied to 5G technology, according to researchers.The campaigns, dubbed \u201cOperation Di\u00e0nx\u00f9n\u201d, target and lure victims working in the telecom industry. A typical ploy includes a fake website designed to mimic telco-giant\u2019s Huawei career page.\u201cWhile the initial vector for the infection is not entirely clear. [We believe] with a medium level of confidence that victims were lured to a domain under control [a] the threat actor, from which they were infected with malware,\u201d according to McAfee researchers in a Tuesday report.\nGiven the tactics used in the campaign, researchers surmised it to be the work of known Chinese-language APTs RedDelta and Mustang Panda. RedDelta was last believed to be behind cyberattacks against the Vatican and other Catholic Church-related institutions last year. In those attacks, adversaries leveraged spear phishing emails laced with malware that ultimately pushed the PlugX remote access tool (RAT) as the final payload.Meanwhile, Mustang Panda has been linked to cyberespionage attacks on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) with a focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia by using shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX. The group also is known to shift tactics and adopt new tools quickly, researchers have noted.This time around, the groups seem to be gunning for sensitive data and aiming \u201cto spy on companies related to 5G technology,\u201d researchers wrote. The campaign is likely related to a number of countries\u2019 decision to ban the use of Chinese equipment from Huawei in the global rollout of the next-generation wireless telecommunications technology, researchers suggested.The APTs used a multi-phased approach to the attacks, with the initial delivery vector likely coming in the form of a phishing attack using the internet as the first point of contact with victims, researchers said with \u201ca medium level of confidence.\u201dOnce someone falls for this aspect of the campaign, the second phase executes a .NET payload on the victim\u2019s endpoint by leveraging Flash-based artifacts malware, according to the report.\u201cWhile the execution of the initial fake Flash installer acts mainly like a downloader, the [.NET] payload contains several functions and acts as a utility to further compromise the machine,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThis is a tool to manage and download backdoors to the machine and configure persistence.\u201dIn the third and final phase of the attack, threat actors create a a backdoor for remote control of the victim via a Command and Control Server and Cobalt Strike Beacon, according to the report.Researchers recommend \u201can adaptive and integrated security architecture\u201d to defend against multi-layered attacks such as Di\u00e0nx\u00f9n, \u201cwhich will make it harder for threat actors to succeed and increase resilience in the business.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:March 24:\u00a0Economics of 0-Day Disclosures: The Good, Bad and Ugly (Learn more and register!)April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)Government",

        "raw text": "The ransomware gang behind an attack on videogame developer CD Projekt Red may have made good on its promise to auction off the company\u2019s data \u2013 including source code for Cyberpunk 2077 and an unreleased version of the Witcher 3.Or it may not have.The Twitter account @vxunderground, which bills itself as \u201cthe largest collection of malware source code, samples and papers on the internet,\u201d put out a notice on Wednesday that the purported stolen data was being put up for sale on the well-known Russian-language underground forum \u201cExploit,\u201d and it provided alleged screenshots.\u201cThis is the source code to \u2018Gwent\u2019 card game,\u201d according to the tweets. \u201cWitcher 3, CyberPunk 2077, etc. is being auctioned today on EXPLOIT forums\u2026The ransomware authors said they will not be auctioning data anywhere else \u2013 any other location other than EXPLOIT is fake.\u201d@vxunderground also said that the information had a starting bid of $1 million, but they whole cache could be bought outright for $7 million.When asked to independently verify the claim, Austin Merritt, cyber-threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, told Threatpost that the auction posting did indeed exist. An Exploit user named \u201credengine\u201d created a thread in the auctions section of the site, entitled \u201cAuction date for CD Projekt RED\u201d when translated from the Russian.\u201cThe user claimed to have full source codes for various games including Thronebreaker, Cyberpunk 2077, Witcher 3 and the undeclared Witcher 3 RTX (a version of Witcher with raytracing),\u201d Merritt said. \u201cThe user also claimed to have dumps of internal documents and files related to CD Projekt RED \u2018offenses.'\u201dAs for cost and timing, Merritt said that the poster set the auction to start Thursday, Feb. 11 at 13:00 Moscow time (5 a.m. ET), and that bidders would be required to make a 0.1 BTC deposit (around $44,900 at press time) to enter.\u201cThe user started the auction at $1 million, however, users have not yet expressed any interest in purchasing this information,\u201d Merritt told Threatpost. \u201cAt the time of writing, there have been six replies to the original post. Users that have replied have largely questioned the legitimacy of the post, alleging that user \u2018redengine\u2019 does not have an established reputation on the forum.\u201dThus, it\u2019s unclear if what the user is offering is legitimate, or if the posting is from an opportunist trying to take advantage of the buzz around the stolen data that percolated up this week in media accounts.Merritt gave Threatpost a screenshot of the alleged Gwent data files:CD Projekt Red has not responded to a request for comment or verification.CD Projekt Red Ransomware StrikeThe Warsaw-based videogame company tweeted out a notice on Tuesday, warning of \u201ca targeted cyberattack in which some of our systems have become compromised.\u201dThe attackers \u2013 believed to be part of the \u201cHello Kitty\u201d ransomware gang, as Threatpost previously reported \u2014 acknowledged that the ransomware itself would likely not be a problem for the company, which had backups in place to quickly remediate the attack. More concerningly, the attackers threated to dump troves of stolen company data online \u2013 including game source code.\u201cWe have encrypted all of your servers, but we understand that you can most likely recover from backups,\u201d according to the ransom note shared by CD Projekt Red. However, \u201csource codes will be sold or leaked online, and your documents will be sent to our contacts in gaming journalism.\u201dIt went on to say that not paying up would have an impact on the company\u2019s public image, stock price and investor confidence (CD Projekt Red is traded in over-the-counter markets). The attackers also claimed that the information will expose how terribly the company is run.Release of the source code would allow fans to develop game hacks and perform all kinds of \u201cmodding\u201d (i.e., development of custom features) and jailbreaks; and would be a gift to competitors.Threatpost WEBINAR:\u00a0Is your small- to medium-sized business an easy mark for attackers?\u00a0Save your spot for\u00a0\u201c15 Cybersecurity Gaffes SMBs Make,\u201d a\u00a0\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Feb. 24 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Cybercriminals count on you making these mistakes, but our experts will help you lock down your small- to mid-sized business like it was a Fortune 100.\u00a0Register NOW\u00a0for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar on Wed., Feb. 24.\u00a0HacksMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A threat actor hacked into the computer system of the water treatment facility in Oldsmar, Fla., and tried to poison the town\u2019s water supply by raising the levels of sodium hydroxide, or lye, in the water supply. The attack happened just two days before NFL\u2019s Super Bowl LV was held nearby in Tampa Bay, according to local authorities.An operator at the plant first noticed a brief intrusion Friday, Feb. 5, around 8:00 a.m., Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said in a press conference about the incident Monday. Someone remotely accessed the computer system the operator was monitoring that controls chemical levels in the water as well as other operations, he said.\n\nAt first the operator \u201cdidn\u2019t think much of it\u201d because it\u2019s normal for his supervisors to use the remote access feature to monitor his computer screen at times, Gualtieri said. However, around 1:30 p.m. someone again remotely accessed the computer system and the operator observed the mouse moving around on the screen to access various systems that control the water being treated, he said.Lye Levels Raised at Water Treatment PlantDuring the second intrusion, which lasted three to five minutes, the intruder changed the level of sodium hydroxide in the water from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million, \u201ca significant and potentially dangerous increase,\u201d Gualtieri said.\u201cSodium hydroxide, also known as lye, is the main ingredient in liquid drain cleaners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is used to control water acidity and remove metals from drinking water in water-treatment plants.\u201dFortunately, the operator quickly changed the level back to normal after the intrusion and alerted supervisors, who then contacted the Pinellas County Sheriff\u2019s Office. Gualtieri said his team notified the FBI and U.S. Secret Service and worked with them over the weekend to investigate and try to discover who was behind the attack.At this time authorities have leads but have not identified a suspect, nor do they know if the attack came from inside the United States or outside the country, he said.Motive Behind Hack Remains ElusiveThey also do not have a motive for the attack, although it did occur just before the Super Bowl was held in Tampa Bay on Sunday. The event can typically draw upwards of 150,000 visitors to the region but this year only about 22,000 live spectators were allowed to attend the game due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Still, Gualtieri asked all critical infrastructure operators in the Tampa Bay area to check to ensure that their systems have the latest security protocols in place. He also stressed that despite the seriousness of the Oldsmar incident, \u201cat no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated.\u201d\u201cImportantly, the public was never in danger,\u201d Gualtieri said.Even if the operator hadn\u2019t so quickly noticed the nefarious activity, he said it would have taken 24 to 36 hours for the tainted water to hit the water supply, and redundancies in the system would have tested it before then and caught the high levels of sodium hydroxide.At Risk: Critical InfrastructureStill, the incident is a dire reminder of the potential catastrophic effect an attack on critical infrastructure can have on public safety, making the security of these systems a top concern, security experts said.\u201cWith so much emphasis recently placed on hacks for the health care and financial services industry, an infrastructure hack such as this tends to hit much closer to home as it regards our physical safety,\u201d noted Tom Garrubba, CISO of Shared Assessments, in an email to Threatpost.Indeed, given past attacks on the U.S. critical infrastructure such as the power grid, water systems and nuclear plants, organizations in control of these systems should take the latest attack in Florida as a call to action, observed Hitesh Sheth, president and CEO at Vectra, a San Jose, Calif.-based provider of AI for detecting cyberattacks, in an e-mail to Threatpost.\u201cProtecting these critical facilities, and upgrading their cyber defenses, should be a far higher priority,\u201d he said.Some experts cited the COVID-19 pandemic for putting critical infrastructure at higher risk due to the necessity of putting remote access capabilities in place sooner than operators of these systems expected for employees forced to work remotely due to pandemic restrictions.\u201cMany organizations have previously felt protected by traditional perimeter security such as firewalls and VPNs,\u201d observed Kevin Dunne, president at Greenlight, a Flemington, New Jersey-based integrated risk management firm, in an e-mail to Threatpost. \u201cHowever, the new shift to work from anywhere has reduced the efficacy of many of these methods and even rendered some of them useless.\u201dRather than use VPNs to secure networks, Dunne suggested that the most effective way to secure remote access is to monitor identity and access \u201cto know exactly who is access critical systems and what they are doing with that access,\u201d he said.BreachCritical Infrastructure",

        "raw text": "On Monday a hacker dumped sensitive data stolen earlier this year\u00a0from the Ledger cryptocurrency wallet\u2019s website. The data was put up for grabs on sites frequented by criminals. And in a twist that surprised no one, the data is now actively being exploited in phishing campaigns.Researchers at security firm Cyble discovered files from the Ledger leak published Monday on a hacker forum, according to a report in BleepingComputer.An archive includes two files named \u201cAll Emails (Subscription).txt\u201d and \u201cLedger Orders (Buyers) only.txt\u201d that contain sensitive data from the breach. The first includes email addresses of 1,075,382 people who subscribed to the Ledger newsletter, according to the report.\nThe \u201cLedger Orders (Buyers) only.txt\u201d reveals more sensitive data, as it contains the names and mailing addresses for 272,853 people who purchased a Ledger device, researchers told BleepingComputer.What is on the LineLedger offers a hardware-based cryptocurrency wallets\u2013secured by a 24-word recovery phrase and an optional secret passphrase that only the owner knows\u2013where clients can store, manage, and sell cryptocurrency.\u00a0Cryptocurrency wallets are designed to store the public and private keys used to receive or spend a specific cryptocurrency, and considered a safer alternative than storing this information on a computer.A Ledger spokesperson told Threatpost in an email Monday that \u201cthe dumped content may be Ledger\u2019s e-commerce database that was exposed during the data breach in June 2020,\u201d although the company is still investigating.\u201cThis database may be used by scammers for\u00a0phishing attacks through emailing and text message campaigns,\u201d the spokesperson said.Ledger has been working to notify affected users via Twitter and responding to customer questions, while also reporting all tweets and Reddit posts that contain a link to the database, the spokesperson told Threatpost. In the meantime, the company is urging users to never share their 24-word phrase, and keep in mind that no one from the Ledger team would request that private information.June Breach BlamedLedger officials became aware of a breach that occurred in June on July 14 when a researcher participating in its bug bounty program informed them of a potential issue with the company\u2019s website, according to a blog post the company made on July 29.While the initial attack was quickly mitigated, the cryptocurrency wallet was attacked again on June 25 \u201cby an unauthorized third party who accessed our e-commerce and marketing database,\u201d the company said.The files access consisted mainly of email addresses but also contact and order details for clients to whom Ledger sends order confirmations and promotional emails. At the time, Ledger assured clients that their \u201cpayment information and crypto funds are safe.\u201dThe company worked an external security organization to conduct a forensic review of the attack and confirmed that it impacted only 9,500 individuals, all of whom were personally contacted by Ledger Support, the spokesperson told Threatpost.Origins of the AttackThe original hack traces back to an API key that gave an unauthorized third party access to part of Ledger\u2019s e-commerce and marketing database. The company disabled the key soon after learning of the situation, officials said.Still, there is evidence that threat actors have used the emails stolen from Ledger to target clients with phishing attacks, according to research from ProofPoint. Attackers use messages claiming to be from the company informing them that their Ledger assets may have been compromised or are at risk in some way.If a victim takes the bait, the attackers backdoor the Ledger Live application, which allows them to steal users\u2019 recovery phrases which in turn can be used by an actor\u00a0\u201cto\u00a0generate\u00a0a copy of the\u00a0user\u2019s\u00a0private keys, allowing them to steal any digital currencies associated with those private keys,\u201d according to ProofPoint.Juicy TargetIndeed, cryptocurrency wallets have been a target for threat actors due to the potential for financial gain. And while they are indeed considered a secure place for users to store their cryptocurrency assets, researchers in 2018 proved that wallets such as Ledger and Trezor are vulnerable to a number of different types of cyber attacks.Threat actors seem to have since taken that info and run with it. Before the July attack on Ledger, researchers discovered widespread campaigns spreading malicious browser extensions abusing Google Ads and well-known cryptocurrency brands including Ledger to lure victims and eventually steal their cryptocurrency wallet credentials. Other wallets targeted in the campaign included Electrum, Exodus, Jaxx, KeepKey, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet and Trezor.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "When Dutch ethical hacker Victor Gevers tried to alert Secret Service that he was able to guess the password to President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter handle last October, there were plenty of skeptics, most notably at the White House. Now, Dutch prosecutors have determined Gevers did, in fact, guess the password to the world\u2019s most powerful Twitter account, but said that he will not be charged with a crime because he was acting honorably to track down vulnerabilities associated with high-profile accounts.Ethical Hacker Vindicated \u201cThis is not just about my work but all volunteers who look for vulnerabilities in the internet,\u201d Gevers told the BBC. Gevers is a respected cyber-researcher who works for the Dutch government by day and in his spare time runs the ethical hacking non-profit GDI Foundation.Gevers said last fall he was performing a random check of high-profile Twitter accounts. It only took him five guesses to come up with the right one for @realdonaldtrump, \u201cMAGA2020!\u201d He said beyond the incredibly weak password, two-factor authentication (2FA) had not been enabled on the account.2FA generates a unique code, sent by email or text to a known device, which must be entered to log in. After Gevers reported the issue to Secret Service and a number of other agencies, including to the White House directly, he received no response but noticed the account was secured with 2FA two days later.Once logged in, Gevers was able to access Trump\u2019s private messages, photos, bookmarks and list of accounts he had blocked.At the time, Gevers speculated Trump didn\u2019t have basic protections in place because they\u2019re a hassle, adding, \u201c\u2026elderly people often switch off two-step verification because they find it too complicated.\u201dDutch Prosecutors Defend HackFollowing an investigation, Dutch authorities were convinced that Gevers was acting in good faith to protect Trump\u2019s security.\u201cThe hacker released the login himself,\u201d Dutch police said, according to BBC. \u201cHe later stated to police that he had investigated the strength of the password because there were major interests involved if this Twitter account could be taken over so shortly before the presidential election.\u201dThe White House denied that the breach occurred, and when Gevers informed Twitter that he was able to guess Trump\u2019s password and access the account, the company said it was skeptical.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence to corroborate this claim, including from the article published in the Netherlands today,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement responding to Threatpost\u2019s inquiries.Dutch police disagree.This wasn\u2019t the first time Trump\u2019s Twitter was left vulnerable. In 2016, Gevers was also able to guess Trump\u2019s password, \u201cyourefired.\u201d\u201cLeaving politics and personality aspects aside, this is still the perfect example of senior management being unsavvy about cybersecurity issues,\u201d Dirk Schrader, global vice president of New Net Technologies, told Threatpost. \u201cCountless security professionals have had this experience, that implementing stricter password rules in the security policy is approved by management for the company with an exception granted for management itself. The need to have senior management supporting security initiatives to become cyber-resilient is far too often impeded by that lack of participation in the efforts. If 2FA is seen as an obstacle, there is no \u2018leading by good example\u2019.\u201dBesides vindicating Gevers claims, this confirmation of an embarrassing lapse in security out of the White House looks more ominous during the same week the U.S. government is trying to grapple with the full extent of the Solar Winds breach.Over the course of his presidency, Trump has used his Twitter account to announce firings at the top levels of government, conduct sensitive diplomatic negotiations with the likes of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un and set domestic policy. A breach could let a malicious actor tank markets, start wars and cause chaos throughout the globe.U.S. Cybersecurity EmergencyThe revelation that the Twitter compromise was real, despite the White House denial, hints at a troubling lack of concern and transparency about cybersecurity at the very top of the government, researchers said.\u201cThis serves as vindication for the researcher; however, it also presents a troubling view of how security may have been handled by the administration,\u201d Jack Mannino, CEO at nVisium told Threapost. \u201cWhile you can\u2019t jump to conclusions about practices elsewhere, these types of incidents are generally associated with teams who have a relatively low level of security maturity. This is certainly not what you would expect or hope for from the White House, if it proved to be true.\u201dWhile the Trump administration grapples with an ongoing, unprecedented number of breaches both large and small without senior staff in place (CISA chief Christopher Krebs was unceremoniously fired by Tweet by Trump last month after defending the integrity of the presidential election), officials from previous administrations say they see this as a moment of dire emergency for the country.Former White House Chief Information Officer Theresa Payton told CNN that the state of U.S. cybersecurity in the wake of the Solar Winds attack is keeping her up at night.\u201cI woke up in the middle of the night last night just sick to my stomach,\u201d said Theresa Payton, who served as White House CIO under President George W. Bush. \u201cOn a scale of one to 10, I\u2019m at a nine \u2014 and it\u2019s not because of what I know; it\u2019s because of what we still don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups continue to use the fog of intense geopolitics to supercharge their campaigns, but beyond these themes, actors are developing individual signature tactics for success.That\u2019s according to Kaspersky\u2019s most recent APT trends report for Q3 2020, which found that some groups are innovating and pushing technical boundaries, while others take a more low-tech approach, honing messaging around COVID, the elections and other headlines.\u201cWhile some threat actors remain consistent over time and simply look to use hot topics such as COVID-19 to entice victims to download malicious attachments, other groups reinvent themselves and their toolsets,\u201d said Ariel Jungheit, senior security researcher at the Global Research and Analysis Team at Kaspersky. \u201cThe widening scope of platforms attacked, continuous work on new infection chains and the use of legitimate services as part of their attack infrastructure, is something we have witnessed over the past quarter.\u201dThese divergent approaches were best represented by two groups in particular, according to the report; DeathStalker and MosaicRegressor.DeathStalkerDeathStalker, the report said, has been successful using the same tactics since 2018 to target law firms and companies in the financial sector.\u201cThe group\u2019s interest in gathering sensitive business information leads us to believe that DeathStalker is a group of mercenaries offering hacking-for-hire services or acting as an information broker in financial circles,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe activities of this threat actor first came to our attention through a PowerShell-based implant called Powersing.\u201dBut while this approach is focused more on messaging around headlines for phishing emails, the report added that a couple of technical developments to DeathStalker\u2019s campaigns are worth nothing.\u201cFor instance, the malware directly connects to a command-and-control (C2) server using an embedded IP address or domain name, as opposed to previous variants where it made use of at least two dead-drop resolvers (DDRs) or web services, such as forums and code-sharing platforms, to fetch the real C2 IP address or domain,\u201d the report explained. \u201cInterestingly, for this campaign the attackers didn\u2019t limit themselves merely to sending spear-phishing emails but actively engaged victims through multiple emails, persuading them to open the decoy, to increase the chance of compromise.\u201dResearchers added this was the first time they observed a malicious actor both using advanced techniques to bypass security, as well as \u201cdropping PE binaries to load EvilNum.\u201dThe Kaspersky team also noted they suspect DeathStalker is using a novel PowerShell implant they named \u201cPowerPepper.\u201d\u201cThe delivery workflow uses a Microsoft Word document and drops a previously unknown PowerShell implant that relies on DNS over HTTPS (DoH) as a C2 channel,\u201d the report said.DeathStalker represents a relatively basic, low-tech set of techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) \u2014 while MosaicRegressor\u2019s UEFI implant occupies the higher-tech end of the APT spectrum.MosaicRegressor In early October Kasperky researchers reported the discovery of \u201crogue UEFI firmware images,\u201d modified to deliver malware, which the team dubbed \u201cMosaicRegressor\u201d as part of a wider framework. Components of the MosaicRegressor framework was part of attacks launched against diplomats and African, Asian and European Non-Government Organizations and traced back to North Korea.UEFI is a specification that constitutes the structure and operation of low-level platform firmware, including the loading of the operating system itself. It can also be used when the OS is already up and running, for example in order to update the firmware. The UEFI firmware bootkit that\u2019s part of MosaicRegressor loads the operating system itself, meaning a threat actor can modify the system to load malware that will run after the OS is loaded. Thus, it will be resistant to reinstalling the operating system or even replacing the hard drive, researchers said.The report added that APT attacks have spiked in recent weeks in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and \u201cvarious regions affected by the activities of Chinese-speaking APT groups.\u201d\u201cOverall, what this means for cybersecurity specialists is this: defenders need to invest resources in hunting malicious activity in new, possibly legitimate environments that were scrutinized less in the past,\u201d Jungheit concluded. \u201cThat includes malware that is written in lesser-known programming languages, as well as through legitimate cloud services. Tracking actors\u2019 activities and TTPs allows us to follow as they adapt new techniques and tools, and thereby prepare ourselves to react to new attacks in time.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "A well-known private hacking forum has recently become more inclusive, introducing a new platform to help newbie threat actors flourish and hone their expertise, research has found. The discovery is unique, as private hacker forums tend to be the exclusive province of elite cybercriminals.Digital Shadows on Thursday published a report that takes a deep dive into CryptBB, an exclusive hacker forum that has been operational since 2017.Initially, the site only accepted new members after a \u201crigorous application and interview process,\u201d requiring that an applicant prove their skill and knowledge on a chosen area of expertise, \u201cleaving no room for those who fail to meet the required standards,\u201d researchers wrote.\n\nHowever, the forum recently has taken steps \u201cto be viewed as a platform for \u2018all,'\u201d by launching near the end of 2019 a designated space for what it called \u201cnewbies,\u201d according to the report. These are hackers who failed the application process but still wanted to hone their skills and learn from not just one another, but also from more expert members of the forum.\u201cThe real surprise was the identification of an application-only forum creating a dedicated subforum for failed applicants, or \u2018newbies\u2019, to converse, share insights, and learn from full-time members,\u201d Alex Guirakhoo, threat research team lead at Digital Shadows, told Threatpost. \u201cHistorically, the only times we have seen exclusive (private) forums lower the parameters for entry are when they have allowed members willing to pay a set fee in order to bypass the application process (this was seen with the English-language forum KickAss and the Russian-language forum Exploit). The payment enabled the forum to gain more members but was also financially beneficial to the forum. In CryptBB\u2019s case, they are using a dedicated subforum to share knowledge and help others for free. They might be doing this for site-traffic metrics, but the intent behind the scheme seems innocent enough and the forum likely feels it is a way to give back and help others to increase their skills/knowledge.\u201dLast month, CryptBB owners went a step further and also began to reach out on the dark web to try to recruit new hackers into the forum. Digital Shadows identified what is called a \u201csubdread\u201d dedicated to CryptBB on the dark web community forum Dread\u2014which has a \u201cfar-reaching and loyal user base\u201d \u2014 in early June, researchers noted.\u201cOn this subdread, CryptBB proclaims itself to be an excellent forum for \u2018newbie\u2019 hackers, programmers, and carders eager to start on their journey while also remaining a private platform for \u2018advanced\u2019 members who can partake in quality discussions and share expertise,\u201d researchers wrote.Digital Shadows imagined a few reasons for this concerted effort to shift from a forum exclusive to expert hackers to one that is now inviting less experienced ones into the fold.One could be to try to preserve and maintain some of the methods and strategies already used by more skilled hackers, researchers surmised. Historically, CryptBB has provided some dedicated services for members to offer, including RDP sales and \u201chackers for hire\u201d services, they said. Earlier this year, the forum\u2019s admin team also began offering penetration testing and bug-reporting services to marketplaces with an assurance of discretion and no \u201cdrama,\u201d researchers reported.Guirakhoo told Threatpost, \u201cWhilst I cannot exactly say for sure the reasons for these latest activities to court new members, it is highly likely that the forum wants/needs additional members for future projects/work and the current range of skill sets of their current membership might be limited. The forum itself has historically been identified to offer bespoke services (e.g. marketplace pen-testing, RDPs, etc.) on other forums, indicating the forum acts as a collective rather than individual entities. This is in contrast to other forums where individual users usually offer specific services. Therefore, the forum admins may recognize a need to sustain a higher member count in order to maintain these services and ensure they are appropriately staffed.\u201dAnother motive for the forum\u2019s cultivation of less experienced hackers suggests that cybercriminals have feelings too, and might actually feel gratified by helping newbies hone their skills, researchers said.\u201cThis may reassure the administration team that they are earning karma to mitigate past misdeeds or provide the sense that they are giving back to their community,\u201d they wrote, adding that this \u201cgive back\u201d behavior already has been observed on Russian-language cybercriminal forums in the form of charity campaigns.Other reasons for the move might be less altruistic. More established members of the forum might want to bolster their own reputation and profile in the cybercriminal scene by passing on knowledge to less experienced hackers, as well as recruit future members to \u201cempower the community as a whole,\u201d researchers noted.Those behind CryptBB also might want to use the newbie forum to expose itself to a wider audience, as an exclusive forum doesn\u2019t garner as much activity and participation as one with a lower barrier to entry. The forum faces competition in terms of sustaining its membership and activity from another called Torum, which is \u201cmore fluid\u201d and has a higher activity level, researchers said.\u201cCreating a dedicated section for novice users improves CryptBB\u2019s image within the cybercriminal scene and encourages other users to participate,\u201d they wrote.Finally, CryptBB admins may actually be trying to learn from experience by loosening requirements for entry into the forum, researchers noted.Out of all the forums launched around the same time, CryptBB is the last one standing. That\u2019s because disgruntled hackers from now-defunct contemporaries, such as KickAss and 0day, became frustrated and began to blab about the forums on other active platforms. This invited unwanted attention from law enforcement and dissent within leadership ranks, among other problems.Overall, the move will \u201clikely increase forum participation in the long-run and therefore establish the forum as a staple in the hacking and carding scene,\u201d according to Digital Shadows.\u201cThis, combined with the various services currently being offered to external parties, clearly demonstrates the administration team\u2019s desire to ensure the forum stands the test of time,\u201d researchers wrote.HacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Fifteen billion usernames and passwords for a range of internet services are currently for sale on underground forums \u2013 shedding light on the sheer scope of compromised credentials that are fueling account takeovers on the internet.A report released Wednesday \u2014 \u201cFrom Exposure to Takeover\u201d by the Digital Shadows Photon Research Team \u2014 found that 100,000 separate data breaches over a two-year period have yielded a 300 percent increase in stolen credentials, leaving a veritable bonanza of account details on dark-web hacker forums up for grabs.Most of the credentials are from consumers, and while many are sold on forums\u2014for an\u00a0average price of $15.43\u2014many also are given away for free by hackers, researchers found.Threat actors \u00a0gain access to these credentials in a number of ways\u2014among them phishing, credential-stealing malware and credit-card skimmers\u2013and it\u2019s never been easier for them to lift this type of sensitive data from user accounts, said Rick Holland, CISO and vice president of strategy at Digital Shadows, in a press statement.Brute-force cracking tools and account checkers are available on criminal marketplaces for an average of $4, as well as new options for account takeover \u201cas-a-service\u201d that allows criminals to \u201crent\u201d an identity for less than $10, he said.\u201cThe sheer number of credentials available is staggering and in just over the past 1.5 years, we\u2019ve identified and alerted our customers to some 27 million credentials \u2013which could directly affect them,\u201d Holland said.Credit: Digital ShadowsThe report also highlights the persistent problem that people aren\u2019t taking even the simplest of proper security measures \u2014 such as changing their passwords frequently, which many still don\u2019t do \u2014 when they use some 191 services that require them to enter their credentials online, Holland noted.\u201cThe message is simple\u2013consumers should use different passwords for every account and organizations should stay ahead of the criminals by tracking where the details of their employees and customers could be compromised,\u201d he said.The credentials being flogged online vary in access and price, according to the report. They include usernames and passwords for everything from bank or financial accounts\u2013which comprised 25 percent of the credentials analyzed\u2013to video- and music-streaming services, to antivirus programs.Unsurprisingly, credentials for bank and other financial accounts are also the most expensive to purchase, selling for an average of $70.91 a piece, researchers found. Indeed, data that puts potential financial gain on the table tends to be the most valuable to threat actors.Data for accessing antivirus programs earned the second-highest price on hacker forums, at an average of $21.67. Threat actors apparently find access to media streaming, social media, file sharing, virtual private networks (VPNs) and adult-content sites far less valuable, with these credentials traded \u201cfor significantly under $1\u201d on forums, according to the report.Credit: Digital ShadowsWhile consumer credentials comprised the bulk of those researchers tracked, organizations are not immune to the risk of credential theft and potential reuse for nefarious purposes, particularly if financial gain is involved. The report uncovered 2 million accounting email addresses exposed online, with those referencing \u201cinvoice\u201d or \u201cinvoices\u201d the most commonly advertised on hacker forums, researchers said.The big \u201cpassword problem\u201d has plagued the security industry for years. Poor password hygiene, including reusing passwords or picking easy-to-guess passwords, is greatly exacerbating many of the major issues that plague the cybersecurity landscape, security experts like\u00a0Troy Hunt have said in the past.\u00a0Making matters worse, passwords are appearing left and right online as part of major data breaches \u2013 yet victims aren\u2019t changing their passwords at all across various platforms. The\u00a0Collection #1\u00a0data dump, which included 773 million credentials, and subsequent\u00a0Collection #2-5 dumps, show exactly how many passwords are available on the Dark Web and underground forums.Digital Shadows researchers for their part recommend that businesses monitor for leaked credentials of their employees, keep an eye out for mentions of their company and brand names across cracking forums and educate their staff about the dangers of password reuse.BEC and enterprise email fraud is surging, but DMARC can help \u2013 if it\u2019s done right.

        "raw text": "\u201cFxmsp,\u201d a notorious hacker who made headlines last year for allegedly stealing and selling source code and customer access from McAfee, Symantec and Trend Micro, has been outed. He\u2019s a Kazakh national named Andrey Turchin, and according to unsealed court documents, he faces hacking charges dating back to 2018.The documents were unsealed by the Western District of Washington after Fxmsp was profiled and his real name revealed by security firm Group-IB, in an analysis last month that went largely unreported. Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, tweeted out the court documents on Tuesday.According to the Feds\u2019 allegations, Turchin is a member of a \u201cprolific, financially motivated cybercriminal group composed of foreign actors that hacks the computer networks of a broad array of corporate entities, educational institutions and governments around the world, including the United States, and advertises and sells such unauthorized access to its victims\u2019 protected systems.\u201dThe documents also allege that the group\u2019s tactics are myriad, including brute-force attacks and phishing schemes; the group also used specially designed code to scan the Internet for open Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) ports.\u201cOnce inside the victim\u2019s system, he moved laterally throughout the network and deployed additional malicious code to locate and steal administrative credentials and establish persistent access,\u201d according to the documents. \u201cThe conspirators often modified antivirus software settings to allow malware to continue to run undetected.\u201dOnce the backdoors were established and credentials stolen, the wares went up for sale across various Russian hacking forums, with prices that ranged into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Last year\u2019s pricing for the security firm data was put up for sale for $300,000, according to a separate report from Advanced Intelligence.\u201cPrices typically ranged from a couple thousand dollars to, in some cases, over a hundred thousand dollars, depending on the victim and the degree of system access and controls,\u201d the Department of Justice said in a media statement. \u201cMany transactions occurred through use of a broker and escrow, which allowed interested buyers to sample the network access for a limited period to test the quality and reliability of the illicit access.\u201dFxmsp even hired a fellow cybercriminal going by \u201cLampeduza\u201d (a.k.a. Antony Moricone, BigPetya, Fivelife, Nikolay, tor.ter, Andropov or Gromyko) as his sales manager in early 2018.U.S. officials said that overall, the group has made an estimated $1.5 million by stealing information from more than 300 targets across six continents and 44 countries \u2013 including 30+ victims in the States.According to Group IB\u2019s expos\u00e9, Lampeduza claimed that the offerings will allow \u201caccess to\u00a0the company\u2019s entire network \u2026 You will become THE INVISIBLE GOD OF\u00a0NETWORKS\u2026\u201dThe firm also detailed Turchin\u2019s tactics: \u201cAfter gaining access to the target device, Fxmsp usually disables the existing antivirus software and firewall, then creates additional accounts. Next, he uses the Meterpreter payload on servers as a backdoor. Fxmsp himself noted in his posts that, when installing backdoors, he set a long interval for connections with C2 servers: once every 15 days. Once the access is gained, Fxmsp harvests dumps of all the accounts and decrypts them. Finally, he infects the backups by installing backdoors.\u201dEven if the victim noticed suspicious activity in the system, changing passwords and resetting to backups would be of no avail, since the backdoors were in place and the backups had already been compromised.\u201cFxmsp is one of the most prolific sellers of access to corporate networks in the history of the Russian-speaking cybercriminal underground,\u201d Group-IB\u2019s Dmitry Volkov said in a June blog posting. \u201cDespite rather simplistic methods he used, Fxmsp managed to gain access to energy companies, government organizations, and even some Fortune 500 firms.\u201dThe court documents lay out five felony charges against Turchin, going back to 2018 when investigators from the FBI, the U.K.\u2019s National Crime Agency and private security companies uncovered his true identity. These include conspiracy to commit computer hacking, two counts of computer fraud and abuse (hacking), conspiracy to commit wire fraud and access-device fraud.Turchin is unlikely to be prosecuted anytime soon: Kazakhstan does not have an extradition treaty with the United States, and because Turchin is a Kazakh citizen, the case will likely be prosecuted in that country.While activity under the handle \u201cFxmsp\u201d disappeared after the security-firm incidents, Volkov believes the activity could continue, just under a different moniker.\u201cIt is uncertain\u2026whether he is still breaking into company networks and continues to make private offers,\u201d he wrote.BEC and enterprise email fraud is surging, but DMARC can help \u2013 if it\u2019s done right.

        "raw text": "A hacker accused of selling hundreds of millions of stolen credentials from last year\u2019s \u201cCollection 1\u201d data dump on the dark web has been arrested in the Ukraine.The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) took into custody a threat actor known as \u201cSanix,\u201d who they claim posted 773 million e-mail addresses and 21 million unique passwords on a hacker forum last year, according to a press release. The SSU said it worked with the Ukrainian cyber police and National Police on the investigation. Authorities did not release his real name.Known as Collection 1, the database of breached emails was discovered on a popular underground hacking forum on Jan. 17, 2019. At the time Troy Hunt, the researcher behind the HaveIBeenPwned database, quantified the trove of data as 1,160,253,228 unique combinations of email addresses and passwords.\n\u201cCollection 1 is a set of email addresses and passwords totalling 2,692,818,238 rows.\u00a0It\u2019s made up of many different individual data breaches from literally thousands of different sources. (And yes, fellow techies,\u00a0that\u2019s a sizeable amount more than a 32-bit integer can hold.),\u201d he wrote in a January 17, 2019 blog post.The database appears to be just the tip of the iceberg of stolen credentials Ukrainian authorities found at Sanix\u2019s residence in the Ivano-Frankivsk region of western Ukraine upon his arrest, they said.\u201cThe hacker had at least seven similar databases of stolen and broken passwords, the total amount of which reached almost terabytes,\u201d according to the release. \u201cThese included personal, including financial, data from residents of the European Union and North America.\u201dIn all, authorities seized computer equipment with 2 terabytes of stolen information along with phones that show evidence of illegal activities, as well as about $10,000 in cash from illegal transactions in both Ukrainian hryvnias and U.S. dollars, they said.To track Sanix down, authorities recorded the sale of databases with logins and passwords to e-mail boxes, PIN codes for bank cards, e-wallets of cryptocurrencies and PayPal accounts, they said. They also tracked information on computers being used in botnets and for organizing DDoS attacks.Initially there was some disagreement by security experts over who actually was responsible for selling the Collection 1 credentials on forums. After they were discovered, Sanix and two other forum users\u2013\u201cC0rpz\u201d and \u201cClorox\u201d\u2014also claimed responsibility for the data dump.Security researcher Brian Krebs of the KrebsonSecurity blog identified Sanix early on as the hacker who attempted to sell the 87-gigabyte database, which on the forum was created by C0rpz. However, a month later, researchers from Recorded Future said that C0rpz was the true seller of Collection 1.\u201cSanix was the individual identified by Brian Krebs\u2026 and our analysis confirmed that this is the same individual who attempted to sell the database originally created by C0rpz,\u201d researchers said at the time.However, even after Sanix was subsequently banned from the forum, C0rpz posted links to MEGA sharing Collection #1 free of charge to the community, they said.With the arrest of Sanix, it appears Krebs may have been right, however. At the time Krebs contacted the hacker to delve more into the origin of Collection 1, which Sanix said was already two to three years old. He also told the security researcher that he had other password packages\u2014more than 4 terabytes\u2019 worth\u2014that included fresher credentials.Sanix is currently cooperating with Ukrainian authorities to prepare \u201ca report on suspicion of unauthorized interference with computers\u201d and their unauthorized sale or dissemination, according to the SSU release.Concerned about the IoT security challenges businesses face as more connected devices run our enterprises, drive our manufacturing lines, track and deliver healthcare to patients, and more?

        "raw text": "Hackers have a new favorite topic of conversation on underground forums: How to obtain \u2013 and leverage \u2013 valuable credentials for Zoom, Skype, Webex and other web conferencing platforms increasingly used by remote workers.That\u2019s what Etay Maor, chief security officer at IntSights, has discovered over the past few weeks in his examinations of various underground forums. In his investigations, he\u2019s found troves of recycled Zoom credentials being shared, starting with 2,000 credentials a few weeks ago, and continuing to this week with the discovery of\u00a0multiple databases uncovered in new, Tuesday research.\u00a0Maor\u2019s discoveries are similar to those of other researchers, who have previously found as many as 500,000 credentials being sold (for less than a penny each) by cybercriminals.\u00a0Beyond the trade-off of credentials, underground forums are also abuzz with discussion around launching credential stuffing attacks, phishing campaigns, DDoS attacks and data exfiltration attacks against remote workers \u2013 painting a grim picture for users of web conference platforms who don\u2019t stay up to date with the best security practices.Learn more about what Maor\u2019s investigations into underground forums have revealed about how credentials are being uncovered, shared and leveraged to attack remote workers, in this week\u2019s Threatpost podcast.Download directly here or listen to the podcast below.Below find a lightly edited transcript of the podcast.\u00a0Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch:\u00a0Hi, everyone, welcome back to the Threatpost podcast. This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch and I\u2019m joined today by Etay Maor, the chief security officer at IntSights. Etay, thank you so much for coming onto the show today.Etay Maor:\u00a0Thank you for having me. Glad to be here.Lindsey: It\u2019s been an absolute whirlwind of a month for companies who have been moving their workforces online and remote. And along with this heavy shift over to remote work, we\u2019re also seeing a higher usage of platforms like Zoom, like Cisco WebEx, like Skype. And of course, with more people using these conferencing platforms, cybercriminals are all over them as well, whether it\u2019s for phishing or stealing valuable information or other malicious purposes. So Etay from your end, you\u2019ve been looking at underground forums, which is always helpful in that it sheds light on what type of data cybercriminals are looking for, as well as what they\u2019re hoping to do with that data. So tell us a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in these underground forums right now.Etay:\u00a0Right. So actually, one of the first things that we started seeing in terms of the collaboration tools, is we monitor the deep and dark web and one of the things that we look for is to see what type of discussions are there; actually numbers, how many times specific tools and technologies are being mentioned. And what\u2019s interesting is we saw in different forums where criminals were talking, [they] were not talking about any vulnerabilities against targeting Zoom, WebEx and all these conferencing tools. And all of a sudden in January it started climbing and really\u00a0spiking in March. So it really showed us that the heightened interest that cybercriminals have in collaboration tools. Now, with the current situation, what\u2019s significantly changed is that the entirety of the workforce is working from home, making them even more vulnerable to attacks, because people who work from home don\u2019t have all the protective mechanisms and software and different shields that you get when you work from \u201cinside the \u00a0the wire,\u201d and so criminals saw the obvious opportunity here to target people at home and target these collaboration tools, that a lot of these companies\u2026 have not used before.Lindsey: Yeah, definitely. And that that does make sense because of just kind of the widening installed base for these different platforms. Now, a few weeks back, you had found that there were more than 2,000 compromised Zoom credentials that were missing\u00a0being shared on underground forums. And this week, you also came out with a new discovery that multiple other uncovered databases are being shared as well. Now, can you tell us a little bit more about what specifically is being shared here in terms of the specific data?Etay: Sure. So there have been multiple databases, not just the one that we we uncovered with the 2,000, there are several other significant, pretty large, databases that have been shared. And those credentials include a username and password, in this case, it was for Zoom accounts. In some cases, it also included information like the host key so the password that the owner has, and his virtual room, so the URL to his virtual room. Now because of the fact that the information in the database was not homogeneous, so it was it was different. Some of them were only username and password, some of them were\u00a0more than that. It pretty much was clear that this was not as a hack into Zoom, nobody stole Zoom\u2019s database. And after further research, what we found out is that the attackers are using old username and passwords, and trying out credential stuffing attacks. What do I mean by credential stuffing attacks? What the attackers are doing, they\u2019re going into old databases, some of them is oldest from 2012, and 2013. You can find these databases in a lot of different underground forums, in some cases, even on the clear web. And what they do is they take the email and passwords from different hacked databases, and they just test them automatically against in this case, again, it was Zoom. And if somebody happened to use the same email and password on a certain application that was hacked in the past on Zoom as well, then the attacker would get a response from the Zoom website saying this username and password are legit, and would reply back and so they collect all these positive replies\u00a0and compile a new database of Zoom\u2019s specific username and passwords. And they don\u2019t even bother selling it. They\u2019re just sharing it in the underground.Lindsey: Mm hmm. Yeah. I mean, that was something else I wanted to mention, you know, this concept of sharing as opposed to selling. Why might a cybercriminal be doing that? Is it just to show that they\u2019re able to or what\u2019s kind of the purpose there?Etay: Yeah. So you have to keep in mind that the criminal underground is a highly collaborative ecosystem. In fact, in some of these forums, if you even if you are able to get in them, they will kick you out unless you buy something, sell something or collaborate and share information. And so in many cases, these types of sharing are, as you mentioned, just to show that I can, in other cases, just to get some, some credibility with other forum members. And in other cases, it is really just to collaborate and \u201chey, you can use this for free.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a lot of effort for them to create these databases. Unfortunately, they\u2019re very good at communicating, helping each other out. I mean, I\u2019ve seen some underground forums where I\u2019ve seen different threat actors from countries which are war with each other, and they collaborate because there\u2019s money at the end of the day to be made. So yeah, it\u2019s simply out there for free.Lindsey: Can you talk a little bit about what kind of impact that this access to these credentials gives for cybercriminals? I mean, what kind of malicious activities would this help cybercriminals carry out?Etay: So in the case of Zoom, it applies to also other collaboration tools, but let\u2019s take the Zoom example, if an attacker has a username and password to a company\u2019s Zoom account, I can think about it in three different layers of aggression that he can approach this layer number one is more\u00a0around what we\u2019ve seen, like Zoom bombings, just go on to a meeting, and blast music or videos and annoy everybody, like a denial of service attack. Pretty low grade stuff. More delicious than that is potentially you can use that username and password to join a meeting. Let\u2019s say 5, 10 minutes after it started. Hopefully, we can just try and access the meetings. And usually if somebody is already in a meeting, they won\u2019t notice that a new person came in, especially if like there\u2019s a presentation in full screen mode, and you can just eavesdrop. So you can use this to eavesdrop on company meetings. And I think the more aggressive approach to use this is similar to what we call business email compromise. You can use this this credentials to impersonate somebody within the company. So potentially you could ask somebody to send money or maybe send you a presentation or some files. So you can impersonate a\u00a0new social engineering technique to really spy and collect information from from the enterprise.Lindsey: Right. And it\u2019s interesting that you bring it up because obviously Zoom bombing or kind of the DDoS angle there has been garnering widespread news coverage, and rightly so in certain cases. But I would say that the other two types of attacks that you mentioned, which is kind of the social engineering purposes and the access to the sensitive files or data are very serious ones as well and and even a little more serious there. Now, one interesting development that you had mentioned in your research was several popular cybercrime forums had actually \u2013 the administrators had actually decided to ban any user from discussing or selling Zoom credentials and attacks. So can you talk a little bit about what you were seeing there and kind of why this is happening?Etay: Yeah. So we have seen this type of activity\u00a0by them in the past where they banned certain discussions if they thought that it would get them negative press. For example, almost all of these underground hacking and cybercrime forums ban any form of for example, pedophilia, which you know, is understandable.\u00a0And so there are certain rules, it\u2019s not a complete mayhem in these forums, there are administrators, there are moderators and they want to keep the discussions clean, so to speak, you know, only only crime focused.\u00a0Now, if they get too much attention in some cases, like this case, this specific forum was quoted in the media and they didn\u2019t like the spotlight shining on them. And so they\u2019re now banning and any discussion around this specific topic, because you know, they don\u2019t want to be in the media. They don\u2019t want to get this this coverage. We\u2019ve seen this in other forums. It\u2019s sometimes technology based, in some cases it\u2019s regional based, for example, it\u2019s a well known rule that Russian criminals don\u2019t attack Russia. I think it\u2019s pretty obvious why as well. So they do have these limitations and these rules and guidelines in different forums based on what you\u2019re allowed or not allowed to do.Lindsey: And in terms of other types of credentials from other types of collaboration apps, are you seeing anything that either different or the same in terms of you know, Slack or Skype or WebEx or some of the other ones?Etay: So we\u2019ve definitely seen discussions around vulnerabilities and exploits against WebEx. We\u2019ve seen phishing attacks targeting WebEx as well.\u00a0I\u2019ll tell you what really kind of, doesn\u2019t worry me, but where I think this is going, the fact that the attackers are now automating their attacks and using these credential stuffing attacks to recycle old passwords\u00a0and test them on on these applications. This is not a new technique. But since now everybody\u2019s working from home. And even when things calm down and we start going back to workplaces, there\u2019s still going to be a change. A lot of people still continue working from home, a lot more people are going to be using these collaboration tools. And I think we\u2019ll see a lot more of these types of, \u201chey, let\u2019s see if the old username and password work on these other applications.\u201d And for me, as a security researcher, we\u2019ve been saying this for a long time in the security industry, you need a strong password, but don\u2019t make a strong password the same one over and over and over again, because that makes it inherently weak. It doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t matter how long it is, if you reuse it, then the attacker can try and use it on other applications. And unfortunately, it\u2019s working for them right now. So I think we\u2019ll see more of these types of attacks regardless of the collaboration tool. They\u2019re going to try to use it and and get access.Lindsey: Right, yeah, it kind of defeats the purpose if you have a strong password but then you\u2019re using it on every single one of your platforms.Etay: Yeah. And I get it. I know it\u2019s hard to remember these passwords and, there are solutions to that, you have things like password wallets, but not everybody wants to use a password wallet. So I get that it\u2019s it\u2019s complicated, but we have to understand that there are\u00a0risks involved in that. And if I can add another thing here is there\u2019s also stuff that can be done proactively to help against these types of attacks both both from the application developer side, as well as from our side. For example, if a certain service offers you two-factor authentication, use it. That will help you because the attacker when he tries to log into your account won\u2019t be able to overcome the two-factor authentication, the one time password challenge from the vendor, the software vendor side, if you\u2019re developing such an application, say like Zoom, if you force some sort of CAPTCHA during the login process, then these automated attacks can\u2019t\u00a0happen because they won\u2019t be able to unlock the CAPTCHA question and even try the username and password. So there are things that we can do. But we just have to put a little bit of extra effort into it.Lindsey: Right, I was actually just about to ask you know if there any further security precautions or measures that you would recommend, not just for Zoom users, but just as best practices kind of across the board.Etay: Yes. So several recommendations going from general ones to the applications. First of all, let\u2019s start with basic security hygiene. Make sure your system is patched and up to date. A lot of vulnerabilities and exploits utilize the fact that people don\u2019t update their software and so they can attack old software versions, so make sure everything is patched, is up to date. Also, if your company provides you with any security measures, don\u2019t be the hacker that overcomes them. I\u2019ve already heard discussions from different people saying oh, we have a VPN but we\u2019re not going to use it, it\u2019s too slow, no, that really helps in certain types of attacks. So make sure that you utilize the technologies that are given given to you by your organization. Of course, also, if you\u2019re working from home, don\u2019t use your personal computer if somebody assigned a laptop to you because that laptop may have some additional security capabilities that your personal computer does not have. Now, if we move from the device side to the application, then yes, utilize if you have the option of using two-factor authentication, one-time passwords, use that, there\u2019s nothing 100 percent proof that I\u2019ll tell you that once you use it, 100 percent of your the attacks will stop. But what it will definitely do is it will not make you the lower hanging fruit for the attacker. Because overcoming a username and password versus overcoming a username and password and a one time password is a significant difference. So do use these extra capabilities. And one more thing. When you\u00a0install any new software, when you install any new hardware in your house like a router, take the couple of minutes to sit down and look at the security settings. A lot of these applications, including some of the ones that we\u2019ve discussed, there, there are security options, but they\u2019re very lax. If you do the regular installation, go in there and make sure that you shut down things that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with. When you install a home router, make sure that you change the default password and maybe close down some things that shouldn\u2019t be open. Again, it will not bulletproof you for everything, but it will make you a harder target.Lindsey: Right. Yeah, those are really good points, especially as more employees are going remote and working remotely. So before we wrap up, I just wanted to ask, is there any other takeaways that you\u2019re seeing in terms of trends on the underground forums that you\u2019re looking at, that we should kind of be on the lookout for as it relates to remote work and certain threats that remote\u00a0workers may be facing?Etay: I think we should just be aware that there is a very lively and informative underground community that talks about these things that shares information, they post the different articles you see on mainstream media, and they discuss, how to take advantage of it. One of the first indications, it was actually very early in January, somebody on the forum said, \u201cHey, this COVID-19 situation looks to be getting bigger. Does anybody have a phishing template that I can use that will say it\u2019s a coronavirus website that you can check if how many people have been infected?\u201d So they started very early, about three months ago already designing these things. These kinds of opportunities don\u2019t go over their head, they see them and they utilize them. So please be aware of these types of threats. Be aware that there are bad guys out there trying to take advantage of it, and\u00a0if there is a doubt, if you see an email, a piece of software for your phone or for your PC, that looks even remotely not\u00a0right don\u2019t click it. Take another minute to do some checks and look around and make sure that it is indeed legitimate because there are those people out there who are actively trying to target.Lindsey: You know, I know that cyber criminals are usually on top of, you know, tax filing season or elections or whatnot when it comes to phishing, but it really seems like they\u2019ve doubled down on everything that\u2019s happening with coronavirus or with you know, financial stimulus packages. And in this case, like Zoom and some of the other ones it doesn\u2019t seem like this is going to be going away anytime soon.Etay:\u00a0No, they have an opportunity, they are fully utilizing it. You mentioned the the stimulus package, they have started discussions around that as well.\u00a0They couldn\u2019t lead a good opportunity to get away from their hand. And I mean, the fact that people have a lot of fear when it comes to coronavirus, who is infected and what are the numbers, they of course try to take advantage of it and utilize it for making money and hacking into accounts.Lindsey: Right, well, something to be on the lookout for from the defensive side. So, on that note, Etay thank you so much again for coming on to the Threatpost podcast to talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of collaboration platform credentials on underground forums.Etay: Thank you very much for having me.Lindsey: Great.

        "raw text": "Israel\u2019s Nation Cyber Directorate confirmed in a tweet on Monday that a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against a telecommunications provider took down several government sites, as well as others not affiliated with the government. The incident led to the Directorate to briefly declare a state of emergency, while sources said the\u00a0cyberattack was the largest ever against Israel.\u201cUpdate: In the last few hours, a [DDoS] attack has been identified on a communications provider which, as a result, has for a short time prevented access to a number of sites, including government sites,\u201d the Cyber Israel account tweeted.Haaretz reported the sites for the Israeli departments of interior, health, justice, welfare and even the Prime Minister\u2019s office were taken offline (services are now restored). A source identified by Haaretz as a member of the \u201cdefense establishment\u201d noted the size of the attack, adding that only a nation-state backed threat actor could have pulled off such a large-scale attack.Internet tracker NetBlocks reported that the attacks were launched against Israeli telecom providers Bezeq and Cellcom.https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1503465330315825152Meanwhile, cybersecurity watchers and experts suspect Iran was behind the attack.\u201cThe recent DDoS attacks against Israel have been attributed to actors aligned with Iran, highlighting the significant ongoing tensions between the two countries,\u201d Chris Morgan, senior cyber-threat intelligence analyst with Digital Shadows, told Threatpost by email.He said the timing indicates the DDoS attacks were in retaliation for Israel\u2019s attempt to breach Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, Morgan explained.\u201cThe attacks occurred just hours after Iranian state television announced that its security forces had reportedly stopped an attempted sabotage of nuclear centrifuges against a nuclear power plant in Fordow,\u201d he said. \u201cAttacking nuclear centrifuges draws parallels to previous cyberattacks against Iran, notably the Stuxnet incident of 2010; some have suggested this destructive malware attack was the work of Israel\u2019s intelligence services.\u201dIsrael, Uniquely Prepared to Defend Against Cyberattacks Israel is known to have engaged in covert cybersecurity operations across the globe. Jennifer Tisdale, CEO of GRIMM, told Threatpost \u2014 including developing the Stuxnet worm that was deployed against Iran. As a result the country is prepared to respond to attacks on its own systems, she said, adding that it\u2019s an approach the U.S. government should adopt.\u201cToday\u2019s broad cyberattack is just another Tuesday in\u00a0Israel, for the most part,\u201d Tisdale said.\u00a0\u201cIsrael\u2019s approach to cybersecurity offers some solid takeaways the U.S. government could and should embrace.\u201dIt starts with smart government policymaking, she added.\u201cFirst,\u00a0Israel\u00a0has developed cybersecurity public policy that is both robust and nimble,\u201d Tisdale said. \u201cThey have prioritized government funding specific to cyberattack mitigation, preparation and response to protect against other governments or private sector incidents.\u201dAlso, \u201ccybercriminals also face stiff consequences for their actions against Israeli interests,\u201d Tisdale said.\u201cIsrael has also embraced an attacker-oriented response strategy and has developed a practice for holding people and organizations accountable with both national and international law enforcement,\u201d she added. \u201cThough we could debate what an appropriate response should look and feel like, I believe we can all agree that having a cyber-response plan and accountability plan to protect U.S. critical infrastructure, government networks and communication systems should be prioritized.\u201dThough the size of the attack is notable, DDoS attacks in general are common against nations and should be anticipated, Netenrich principal threat hunter John Bambenek told Threatpost.\u201cUltimately, DDoS attacks remain a technique to knock critical infrastructure, such as government websites, offline,\u201d Bambenek said. \u201cThe technique is popular among activists because it doesn\u2019t require much in the way of prep work to pull off. Government targets, such as the Israeli government, are common.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "A new phishing campaign is targeting aspiring government vendors with an invitation to bid on various fake federal projects with the U.S. Department of Labor.Emails branded to look like legitimate communications from the DoL contain malicious links that, rather than leading to a government procurement portal, harvest the credentials of anyone who attempts to login, according to a new report from threat researchers at INKY.\u201cIn this campaign, the majority of phishing attempts had sender email addresses spoofed to look as if they came from no-reply@dol[.]gov, which is the real DoL site,\u201d the INKY team reported in a Wednesday report. \u201cA small subset were spoofed to look as if they came from no-reply@dol[.]com, which is, of course, not the real DoL domain.\u201dThe remainder were sent by phishers from lookalikes dol-gov[.]com, dol-gov[.]us and bids-dolgov[.]us.The phishing lure email texts claim that the DoL is soliciting bids for \u201congoing government projects,\u201d and included a .PDF file attached with government branding. The threat researchers said the efforts were \u201cwell-crafted.\u201d\u201cClick on the button below to access our website to bid,\u201d the phishing email instructs. Once clicked, the link takes victims to various domains impersonating the DoL.Copy & Paste Spoof of DoL Site The malicious site was a copy-and-paste of the website styling code (both HTML and CSS) from the actual Department of Labor site, with the addition of a bright red link directing victims to a credential harvester asking for the login details of a Microsoft or other business account, the report added.\u201cWhen an INKY engineer made a first attempt at entering fake credentials, the site displayed a fake incorrect credentials error,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cBut behind the scenes, those fake credentials had already been harvested (and either stored on the malicious site or emailed to the phisher).\u201dFollowing another attempt to sign in with fake login details, the researchers were redirected to the real Department of Labor site, they reported.\u201cThis nuanced touch, borrowed from con artistry that well predates the digital era, is designed to confuse the victim and delay the moment when they realize that they were taken,\u201d the researchers said.Most of the emails were sent from compromised servers. But some of the lures were sent from domains created by the attackers to trick users into thinking they were from the Department of Labor, they added.To avoid compromise, INKY suggests security teams remind end users that legitimate government domains end in .gov or .mil and that official federal procurement departments do not typically send out cold solicitations for bids.In addition, users could probably use a reminder that its unusual to be asked for email credentials to view a document on an unrelated network, the INKY team recommended.\u201cFor message administrators, it ought to be clear that SMTP servers should not be configured to accept and forward emails from non-local IP addresses to non-local mailboxes by unauthenticated and unauthorized users,\u201d the report added.Password\u00a0Reset:\u00a0On-Demand Event:\u00a0Fortify 2022 with a password-security strategy built for today\u2019s threats.

        "raw text": "A previously unseen advanced persistent threat (APT) group dubbed Harvester by researchers is attacking telcos, IT companies and government-sector targets in a campaign that\u2019s been ongoing since June.According to a Symantec analysis, the group sports a veritable cornucopia of advanced and custom tools, and it\u2019s on a quest to carry out espionage activities in Afghanistan and elsewhere in that region.As of October, the campaign was still ongoing, looking to dig up a bounty of sensitive data.A Sharp Set of ToolsHarvester has invested in a range of tools for scything through organizations\u2019 defenses, Symantec found, including the \u201cGraphon\u201d custom backdoor.Graphon is deployed alongside a tool for gathering screenshots and downloaders for other malware and tools \u2013 offering a host of remote-access and data-exfiltration capabilities.\u201cWe do not know the initial infection vector that Harvester used to compromise victim networks, but the first evidence we found of Harvester activity on victim machines was a malicious URL,\u201d according to Symantec\u2019s writeup. \u201cThe group then started to deploy various tools, including its custom Graphon backdoor, to gain remote access to the network.\u201dThe APT also attempts to avoid notice by using legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for its command-and-control (C2) activity, in a bid to go unnoticed amidst legitimate network traffic.The primary tools used by Harvester are as follows:Graphon: A custom backdoor that uses Microsoft infrastructure for its C2 activity. According to Symantec, it\u2019s compiled as a .NET PE DLL. When executed, it allows Harvester operators to run commands to control their input stream and capture the output and error streams. \u201cThey also periodically send GET requests to the C2 server, with the content of any returned messages extracted and then deleted,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cData that cmd.exe pulled from the output and error streams is encrypted and sent back to the attackers\u2019 servers.\u201dCustom Downloader: This also uses Microsoft infrastructure for its C2 activity, and it leverages an interesting additional evasion tactic, according to the research: a registry value to create a new loadpoint for the malware, which is a location within the file system and registry that\u2019s used to load applications and related files. Then, it opens an embedded web browser within its own interface. \u201cWhile it initially appeared that this URL may have been a loadpoint for Backdoor.Graphon, upon further investigation it appears to be a decoy to confuse any affected users,\u201d researchers noted.Custom Screenshotter: This tool periodically logs screenshots to a file. It saves them to a password-protected .ZIP archive for exfiltration, with all archives older than a week deleted.Cobalt Strike Beacon: This is a commercial, off-the-shelf penetration-testing tool that allows red teams to emulate an attack. Cybercriminals have increasingly used it for nefarious purposes, including spreading laterally within an enterprise environment, uploading files, injecting or elevating processes, and more. In the Harvester implementation, it uses CloudFront infrastructure for its C2 activity.Metasploit: This is another off-the-shelf tool often used by cyberattackers. It\u2019s a modular framework that\u2019s usually used for privilege escalation, but it can also do other malicious things, like screen captures and implementing a persistent backdoor.Do Fear the ReaperThe Symantec team doesn\u2019t yet have enough information to make a specific attribution for who\u2019s behind Harvester, but given its general M.O., it\u2019s likely backed by a specific government, researchers said.\u201cThe capabilities of the tools, their custom development and the victims targeted, all suggest that Harvester is a nation-state-backed actor,\u201d according to the Monday posting from the firm. \u201cThe activity carried out by Harvester makes it clear the purpose of this campaign is espionage, which is the typical motivation behind nation-state-backed activity.\u201dWhile the group is mainly targeting organizations in Afghanistan in the current campaign, it has also struck other targets in the South Asia region. Entities \u201cshould be alert to the malicious activity,\u201d Symantec warned.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Critical InfrastructureGovernmentMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "UPDATEAuthorities from multiple agencies of the Israeli government paid a visit the offices of the NSO Group as part of a new investigation into claims that the secretive firm is selling its spyware to threat actors for targeted attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Defense.A single tweet from the ministry announced the raid on Wednesday, but did not disclose exactly which government agencies participated. Specifically, Israeli agents visited NSO Group\u2019s offices in Herzliya, near the city of Tel Aviv, according to a post by analyst firm Recorded Future\u2019s The Record.\u201cRepresentatives from the number of bodies came today to NSO to examine the publications and claims raised in the matter,\u201d the ministry tweeted (Google translated from Hebrew).NSO Group is working \u201cin full transparency\u201d with authorities, the firm told The Record.\u201cWe are confident that this inspection will prove the facts are as declared repeatedly by the company against the false allegations made against us in the recent media attacks,\u201d the company said, according to the post.However, security experts and industry watchers aren\u2019t so sure of the company\u2019s claim of innocence in the matter.\u201cNSO insists that the report is wrong, but also that it\u2019s fine to spy on people, and also that terrorists will murder us all if they aren\u2019t allowed to reap vast fortunes by helping the world\u2019s most brutal dictators figure out whom to kidnap, imprison and murder,\u201d tweeted Cory Doctorow, an author, journalist and activist.\u201cAs I say, all of this is rather ordinary. The NSO Group\u2019s bloody hands, immoral practices and vicious retaliation against critics are well established,\u201d he added in a separate tweet.Open Investigation According to Israeli news outlet Calcalist, the Israeli government\u2019s actions are the start of an effort to get to the bottom of a report called the Pegasus Project that examined leaked data from the NSO Group and spurred an international incident that\u2019s rapidly escalating.The report in the Guardian newspaper revealed a cache of more than 50,000 mobile phone numbers worldwide that the firm was storing and alleged that Pegasus malware is being used to target activists, journalists, business executives and politicians on a widespread level, using a variety of exploits \u2014 including a zero-click zero-day in Apple\u2019s iOS.Seventeen media organizations participated in the investigative effort, which also accused NSO Group of selling Pegasus to unidentified third-parties, including governments. These entities then use it to infect the phones of dissidents and other people who may be critical of a given regime.The malware can secretly take remote control of the phone to monitor activity, enabling \u201ccustomers\u201d to even read encrypted messages of their targets sent via Signal and Telegram.The report triggered a global response against NSO\u2019s alleged activities, with human rights organization Amnesty International calling \u201cthe vast scale of violations perpetrated through secretive cyber surveillance\u201d \u201ca global human rights crisis.\u201dSecurity experts also weighed in, with one\u2013Paul Bischoff, a privacy advocate at Comparitech\u2014calling NSO an \u201cweapons dealer.\u201d Others, nothing how Pegasus has been exploiting an iOS zero-day flaw, took aim at Apple for its proprietary security ecosystem.Still, while many criticized NSO Group for its activities, some see the report and subsequent investigation as an effort to damage the reputation of the Israeli cyber industry at a time when Israel has come under fire internationally for its continued military actions against the Palestinian state.\u201cThey are trying to hurt the Israeli cyber industry reputation, and NSO won\u2019t be their first neither their last,\u201d tweeted @IntelMA, a user who claims to be part of the North and West Africa military intelligence. \u201cThey have an agenda, and it\u2019s clear.\u201dDespite its claims of innocence, NSO Group seems to be taking the government\u2019s intervention seriously. Late Thursday, the company told news outlet NPR that it has temporarily revoked access to Pegasus from several international government clients so it could investigate whether they are misusing the tool.(This article was updated 7/30 at 8:30 a.m. ET with additional information regarding NSO revoking access to its spy tool.)Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "The APT group Transparent Tribe is mounting an ongoing cyberespionage campaign, researchers said, which is aimed at military and diplomatic targets around the world. The effort features a worm that can propagate from machine to machine while stealing files from USB removable drives.Transparent Tribe (a.k.a. ProjectM and Mythic Leopard), is a prolific group that has been active [PDF] since at least 2013, specializing in widespread spy-craft. In the latest campaign, Kaspersky has observed spearphishing emails going out with malicious Microsoft Office documents containing a custom remote-access trojan (RAT) called Crimson. So far, researchers have found 1,093 targets across 27 countries, with the most-affected being Afghanistan, Germany, India, Iran and Pakistan.Click to enlargeCrimson is executed by way of embedded macros, according to Kaspersky research released on Thursday. It\u2019s a .NET RAT that has a slew of malicious capabilities, including managing remote file systems, capturing screenshots, keylogging, conducting audio surveillance using built-in microphones, recording video streams from webcams, stealing passwords and stealing files.Transparent Tribe has updated Crimson RAT for this campaign, the firm said, adding a server-side component used to manage infected client machines as well as a new USBWorm component developed for stealing files from removable drives, spreading across systems by infecting removable media, and downloading and executing a thin-client version of Crimson from a remote server.\u201cComing in two versions, it was compiled in 2017, 2018 and 2019, indicating that this software is still under development and the APT group is working on ways to improve it,\u201d according to the research.Server-Side Management InterfaceThe server component gives attackers a handy control panel, which provides a list of infected machines and shows basic information about the victims\u2019 systems as well as geolocation information retrieved from a legitimate website using a remote IP address as the input.\u201cAt the top, there is a toolbar that can be used for managing the server or starting some actions on the selected bot,\u201d Kaspersky said. \u201cAt the bottom, there is an output console with a list of actions performed by the server in the background. It will display, for example, information about received and sent commands.\u201dThe bot panel is an interface with 12 tabs, which can be used to manage a remote system and collect information. The tabs match up with various Crimson components \u2013 for instance, there are tabs for explore the remote file system; downloading, uploading and deleting files; keylogging; and monitoring the remote screen and checking what the user is doing on their system.In the remote-screen tab, \u201cthe attacker can retrieve a single screenshot or start a loop that forces the bot to continuously send screenshots to the server, generating a live stream of sorts. The attacker can also configure the RAT component to record the images on the remote system,\u201d according to the analysis.USBWorm ComponentThe freshly added USBWorm component in Crimson RAT behaves as a downloader, infector and USB stealer.\u201cWhen started, it checks if its execution path is the one specified in the embedded configuration and if the system is already infected with a Crimson client component,\u201d explained Kaspersky researchers. \u201cIf these conditions are met, it will start to monitor removable media, and for each of these, the malware will try to infect the device and steal files of interest.\u201dThe infection procedure for USBWorm starts with cataloging all directories on the victim device, the analysis details. The malware then creates a copy of itself in the drive root directory for each one, using the same directory name. It changes the legitimate directories\u2019 attribute to \u201chidden\u201d \u2013 which results in all the actual directories being replaced with a copy of the malware using the same directory name. USBWorm also uses an icon that mimics a Windows directory, tricking the user into executing the malware when trying to access it.\u201cThis simple trick works very well on default Microsoft Windows installations, where file extensions are hidden and hidden files are not visible,\u201d according to Kaspersky. \u201cThe victim will execute the worm every time he tries to access a directory. Moreover, the malware does not delete the real directories and executes \u2018explorer.exe\u2019 when started, providing the hidden directory path as argument. The command will open the Explorer window as expected by the user.\u201dThe data theft procedure lists all files stored on the device and copies those with an extension matching a predefined list: .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .pps, .ppsx and .txt.\u201cOur investigation indicates that Transparent Tribe continues to run a high amount of activity against multiple targets,\u201d said Giampaolo Dedola, security expert at Kaspersky, in a media statement. \u201cDuring the last 12 months, we have observed a very broad campaign against military and diplomatic targets, using a big infrastructure to support its operations and continuous improvements in its arsenal. The group continue to invest in its main RAT, Crimson, to perform intelligence activities and spy on sensitive targets. We don\u2019t expect any slowdown from this group in the near future and we\u2019ll continue to monitor its activities.\u201dIt\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

        "raw text": "A U.S. House Oversight Committee meeting was the most recent victim of a Zoom bombing attack, after the meeting was disrupted at least three different times by uninvited attendees.The incident was disclosed in a\u00a0recent internal letter from Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to Carolyn Maloney (R-NY), chairwoman for the Committee on Oversight and Reform, which is the main investigative committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.\u201cIn spite of the warnings by the FBI and media outlets, on April 3, 2020, you held a Zoom-hosted Member briefing on women\u2019s rights in Afghanistan with the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR),\u201d the letter said to Maloney.\u00a0\u201cDuring this important briefing, the session was \u2018Zoom-bombed\u2019 at least three times. The impact of hacking and malware on Member and staff devices is still being determined.\u201dThe letter does not specify what the Zoom bombers did after they interrupted the meeting, or whether any sensitive data was accessed.Jordan cited this recent incident, as well as China\u2019s involvement with Zoom, as major security issues, and\u00a0called for government officials to \u201cimmediately suspend any current or future use of Zoom systems for official committee activities and take immediate steps to evaluate the Committee\u2019s internal cybersecurity preparedness to prevent hackers from accessing sensitive committee information through the Zoom platform.\u201dWith the coronavirus pandemic\u00a0 driving more organizations to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d by\u00a0going remote \u2013 and thus using Zoom and other web conferencing platforms \u2013 Trolls are taking advantage of this by\u00a0hijacking online meetings. Previous reports of Zoom bombing incidents have pointed to the trolls spreading hate speech such as racist messages, threats of sexual harassment, and pornographic images, which have reportedly driven meeting participants offline or forced meetings to be abruptly cancelled.But for a government meeting, during which sensitive data may be shared, the stakes are higher than mere trolling. The issue of governments utilizing Zoom \u2013 and their knowledge around how to secure Zoom meetings \u2013 was hit with a media spotlight after\u00a0UK prime minister Boris Johnson tweeted a picture of his Zoom meeting in which the meeting ID was visible.Government officials are taking note of the threat. \u00a0The Senate Sergeant of Arms\u00a0this week warned that Zoom posed the threat of \u201cpotential compromise of systems and loss of data, interruptions during a conference and lack of privacy,\u201d according to the letter. Furthermore, the Senate Sergeant of Arms\u00a0noted that no Zoom product was vetted or cleared for use by Senate offices.Zoom bombing has been spiking upwards over the past few weeks, despite\u00a0the FBI cracking down\u00a0on the issue and warning that those who take part in Zoom bombing could face jail time. A recent report by ZDNet recently pointed to attackers gathering in online communities (such as Discord, Reddit and more) to share Zoom conference codes or make Zoom bombing requests against certain online classes, for instance. Many of these attackers are teenagers, according to a recent PCMag report, with some even live streaming their attacks on Twitch.Zoom\u2019s platform overall has also under fire for security and privacy shortfallings over the past month. Most recently, the Ministry of Home Affairs for India issued an advisory for those who want to use Zoom, saying it\u2019s \u201cnot a safe platform.\u201dIn the midst of this fallout, Zoom is taking steps to improve its security, including recruiting an industry heavy-hitter \u2013 former Facebook CISO Alex Stamos \u2013 to provide special counsel. Zoom has also sought to improve its bug bounty program, bringing on bug bounty expert and Luta Security founder Katie Moussouris to assess its bug bounty program.\u00a0As part of these improvements, Zoom is introducing a new feature that lets users report Zoom bombers. This feature will be introduced next week, as a \u201cReport a User\u201d security icon in the lower toolbar.Worried about your cloud security in the work-from-home era?

        "raw text": "A rash of COVID-19 Android mobile apps have emerged that are aimed at helping citizens in Iran, Italy and Colombia track symptoms and virus infections. However, they\u2019re also putting people\u2019s privacy and the security of their data at risk, researchers have found.Security researchers at the ZeroFOX Alpha Team have uncovered various privacy concerns and security vulnerabilities \u2013 including a backdoor in various apps. The apps are either created and endorsed by countries or invented as one-offs by threat actors to take advantage of the current pandemic, according to a blog post published Monday.Researchers analyzed dozens of COVID-19 apps \u2013 which continue to emerge with the spread of the coronavirus, paving the way for related security threats across the globe. In the analysis, they highlighted three that pose a particular threat to citizens, citing not only potential cybercriminal activity but also simple mistakes by app developers.In early March in Iran, one of the first places COVID-19 emerged as a serious health threat, the government released an official app, available on an Iranian app store known as CafeBazaar. The app was meant to track citizens, and it sparked privacy concerns because rather than provide vital health information, it appeared to have the sole purpose of harvesting user personal information, researchers wrote.If the app itself wasn\u2019t worrisome enough, threat actors also created a copycat app, dubbed CoronaApp, available online for direct download by Iranian citizens rather than via the Google Play Store, and thus not subject to the normal vetting process that might protect them from nefarious intentions. At the same time, due to sanctions, many citizens in Iran can\u2019t access the official Google Play store, so they are more likely to download unvetted apps, the researchers pointed out.While CoronaApp does not obviously show malicious intent, it does request permission to access a user\u2019s location, camera, internet data and system information, and to write to external storage. This is a \u201cparticular collection of permissions [that] demonstrates the likely intent of the developer to access sensitive user information,\u201d researchers wrote.Moreover, app creators claim the app is built with support from the Iranian government, though screenshots of the offering do not support this claim, they added.\u201cGiven\u2026its lack of standard transport security, the permissions the app requires versus its description on the splash page and news websites, as well as the functions used in external libraries, Alpha Team assesses with high confidence that this application can be abused in the future,\u201d researchers wrote.Good Intentions Gone WrongIn Colombia \u2013 another country that\u2019s imposed citizen restrictions during the pandemic \u2013 the government last month released a well-intended mobile app called CoronApp-Colombia on Google Play to help people track potential COVID-19 symptoms. However, the app also included vulnerabilities in how it communicates over HTTP, which affect the privacy of more than 100,000 users, ZeroFOX researchers warned.\u201cThe current version, 1.2.9 as of March 25, uses insecure communication with the API server throughout the app workflow,\u201d researchers wrote. Specifically, it uses HTTP instead of the more secure HTTPS or another protocol for API server communications.Since it\u2019s making insecure server calls to relay users\u2019 personal data, CoronApp-Columbia could \u201cput sensitive user health and personal information at risk of being compromised,\u201d researchers explained.\u201cThis API_URL is used multiple times throughout the app and makes HTTP requests to the 52.87.234.39 server, located in the U.S., to relay personal health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII),\u201d they noted. \u201cThe same URL is also hardcoded into additional API calls, without using the API_URL.\u201dIn total, researchers observed 55 HTTP requests that use the URL, and several of these are API payloads that contain PHI and PII, they said.One spot of good news: ZeroFOX Alpha Team submitted the vulnerability, listed on MITRE as CVE-2018-11504, to Colombian CERT on March 26, and the agency fixed the vulnerability three days later, researchers said, showing a \u201crapid security vulnerability response.\u201d Users should thus update to the latest version.Regional DangerIn Italy, one of the places the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the worst, the government has created region-specific apps for tracking coronavirus symptoms, according to Alpha Team. Threat actors are taking advantage of the inconsistency in the apps\u2019 releases and availability to launch malicious copycats that contain backdoors.\u201cA greater number of government-sanctioned applications causes users to be less certain of which COVID-19 mobile apps are legitimate,\u201d according to ZeroFox. \u201cThreat actors have taken advantage of this confusion, and have released malicious applications, like this backdoored app, to prey on users who may mistakenly download the malicious app.\u201dIn all, they found 12 Android application packages related to the campaign. All but one of them used various methods of obfuscation, researchers added.They said that the signing certificate of the first malicious app that they found in this group piqued their suspicion. Though the service for Italian citizens, the signer of the app was \u201cRaven\u201d with a location in Baltimore, likely a reference to the Baltimore Ravens NFL team.\u201cEvery app analyzed by Alpha Team used these signing certificate and issuer details,\u201d researchers said.The backdoor is activated when the Android app receives a BOOT_COMPLETED intent when the phone boots, or when the app is opened, researchers wrote.Researchers advised governments with COVID-19-related apps or those thinking about releasing new ones to \u201censure consistency with where COVID-19 mobile apps are able to be downloaded, and even with their appearance,\u201d to help avoid the spread of malicious doppelgangers.They also recommended due diligence during the development process to secure any government-sponsored mobile apps and avoid putting citizens at further privacy risk.\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic demonstrates a new trend in government- and nation-sponsored COVID-19 mobile apps,\u201d researchers wrote in the post. \u201cIf this is the new norm, then there is a massive amount of risk that everyday citizens inherit if these applications are not properly vetted and distributed.\u201d\nDo you suffer from Password Fatigue?

        "raw text": "As the Chinese government turns to virtual private networks (VPNs) to provide access to official resources for those working remotely amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the DarkHotel APT has seized the opportunity to target those VPNs in a zero-day attack, researchers said.According to security analysts from Chinese firm Qihoo 360, attacks began in March on a Chinese VPN provider called SangFor, used by a number of Chinese governmental agencies. At least 200 VPN servers connecting to multiple endpoints were compromised as of the first week of April, they added.The researchers said that the victims include Chinese agencies in Afghanistan, Armenia, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Malaysia, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, United Kingdom and Vietnam; and, domestic government institutions in Beijing and Shanghai.\u201cOnce VPNs are controlled by threat actors, the internal assets of many enterprises and institutions will be exposed to the public network, and the loss will be immeasurable,\u201d Qihoo 360 researchers wrote in a posting on Monday.The attack was carried out using a zero-day exploit, the firm found, adding that the campaign is complex and required a good deal of skill to execute.\u201cThe vulnerability exists in an update that is triggered automatically when the VPN client starts to connect to the server,\u201d according to the firm, which reported the bug to SangFor. \u201cThe client will obtain [an] update from the configuration file at a fixed location on the connected VPN server, and download a program called SangforUD.exe.\u201dThe client unfortunately doesn\u2019t make any security checks before downloading the executable. As a result, the researchers said, attackers can hijack the session, alter the update configuration file and replace the update program with their own malicious code.\u201cWhen users of the victim agencies used VPN clients, the update process triggered by default was hijacked by the hackers,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cThe update program was replaced and embedded with a backdoor\u2026The attacker imitated the signature of legitimate program to disguise the backdoor and it is hard for a common user to distinguish.\u201dThe vulnerability was found in a server version that SangFor released in 2014. The vendor issued a patch for the bug on Monday, and any admins running the software are encouraged to update their server software versions.A Sophisticated AttackOnce the backdoor program executes as part of what the client believes is a normal update process, it sets up communication with a remote command-and-control (C2) server. It then downloads shellcode for execution.The shellcode does a few things, starting with fingerprinting the infected machine. It collects the terminal\u2019s IP/MAC/system version/process and other software and hardware information and sends it along to the C2.Next, it installs various malicious libraries (DLL components) to set up persistence and load the core backdoor component, which is named thinmon.dll.\u201cThinmon.dll will decrypt another encrypted file, \u2018sangfor_tmp_1.dat,\u2019 issued by the cloud, and start the .dat file in one of the three ways: Loading, thread-starting or injecting process,\u201d the researchers explained.The .dat file in turn offers attackers complete access to the infected endpoint.\u201cWhen VPN users log in successfully, their devices will be fully trusted,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTherefore, it can be said that the attacker a large number of endpoint devices have been under the control of the attackers.\u201dThey added, \u201cThe attacker sophisticatedly designed the backdoor control method and executed the code by completely issuing shellcode from the cloud,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThe entire attack process is very complicated and concealed.\u201dPotential Attribution: DarkHotelQihoo 360 researchers have attributed the attack to DarkHotel, an APT associated with carrying out prior cyberespionage efforts in China, North Korea, Japan and the United States.DarkHotel was first identified in\u00a02014\u00a0by Kaspersky researchers, who said at the time that the group had been active since at least 2007. The APT first became known for targeting diplomats and corporate executives via Wi-Fi networks at luxury hotels \u2013 but it has widened its targeting over the years, while continuing to\u00a0leverage zero-day vulnerabilities\u00a0and exploits.Earlier in 2020, DarkHotel was seen using Office documents for targeted attacks\u00a0using a zero-day in Internet Explorer, and was fingered as the culprit behind a March attack on the World Health Organization (WHO). In that effort, the APT may have been looking for information on tests, vaccines or trial cures, according to researchers.\u201cThis time, DarkHotel attacked many Chinese overseas agencies by breaking through VPN services,\u201d according to Qihoo 360, which said that it arrived at its attribution conclusion via reverse engineering and code analysis. \u201cIs it intended to spy upon China\u2019s medical technology and virus-control measures during the epidemic? Is it also possible that, by attacking Chinese overseas agencies, the group real purpose is to grasp the supply transport routes, quantity and equipment of the quarantine materials that China sends to other countries around the world? What\u2019s more, is it aiming at further probing into the medical data of the epidemic in more countries? At this special time, is Darkhotel intended to obtain the national epidemic data and economic recovery strategy of China?\u201dThis speculation \u2013 and lack of attribution indicators in the post \u2013 caught the attention of at least one observer. Kaspersky researcher Brian Bartholomew tweeted that \u201cin the future, there needs to be more supporting data to support claims.\u201dI\u2019m going to be a bit blunt here. This write up is full of speculation, no evidence this was actually DatkHotel, and a ton of confirmation bias about targeting because of Covid. Not saying they\u2019re wrong, but in the future, there needs to be more supporting data to support claims https://t.co/2K1ajklUwp\u2014 Brian Bartholomew (@Mao_Ware) April 6, 2020Qihoo 360 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Do you suffer from Password Fatigue?

        "raw text": "The Gamaredon advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been supercharging its operations lately, improving its toolset and ramping up attacks on Ukrainian national security targets.Vitali Kremez, head of SentinelLabs, said in research released on Wednesday that he has been tracking an uptick in Gamaredon cyberattacks on Ukrainian military and security institutions that started in December. He said that these include digital attacks on physical infrastructure and field hardware, including artillery \u2013 along with more expected cyber-espionage activity. One of the latter campaigns was a series of reconnaissance actions against the Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Ground Forces Academy, in the Ukraine; and, spyware implants were spotted in a range of Ukrainian governmental targets.\u201cBased on SentinelLabs visibility into some of the affected victims, APT Gamaredon affected a large disposition of victim across Ukrainian separatist line with more than five thousand unique Ukrainian entities affected for the past months,\u201d Kremez wrote.In examining the campaign, SentinelLabs found that Gamaredon has improved its toolset. The latest malware implant appears to be a modified version of the group\u2019s proprietary Pterodo malware, discovered on computers of state authorities of Ukraine performing system reconnaissance.\u201cThis virus collects system data, regularly sends it to command-control servers and expects further commands,\u201d Kremez wrote. \u201cPackaged as self-extracting zip-archive (.SFX), the Gamaredon malware implant components contain a batch script, a binary processor .NET component and macro payloads.\u201dNotably, the implant boasts the addition of a .NET framework interop integrator known as Microsoft.Vbe.Interop.\u201cThe newer tool [carries out] updated execution via an obfuscated .NET application of Excel and Word macros,\u201d wrote Kremez. He added that the macro payload execution approach uses a specific processor that leverages scripting persistence. \u201cThe macro execution security registry [allows] macro execution and disabling Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) warnings,\u201d he said. \u201c[This] malware Interop component [also] uses fake Microsoft digital certificates belonging to Microsoft Time-Stamp Service.\u201dIn addition, the group is also now using a system of Nginx forwarders to process traffic from compromised victim machines, oftentimes relying on dynamic DNS providers, according to the analysis.Gamaredon, which Kremez said is linked to the Russian military, has ramped up its malware capabilities while exclusively targeting the Ukrainian national security institutions.\u201cGamaredon has introduced new tools into its arsenal that significantly up its offensive capabilities,\u201d he noted. \u201cTheir operations have impacted more than five thousand unique Ukrainian entities in the past few months.\u201d He added, \u201cThis ability to efficiently integrate cyber-offense measures into the actual battlefield of a traditional or asymmetric warfare model has been for years tested in the long-term military conflict unfolding in Eastern Ukraine since 2014.\u201dGovernmentMalware",

        "raw text": "A leaky database owned by reservations management system Autoclerk has exposed the personal data and travel information for thousands of users \u2013 including U.S. government and military personnel.Autoclerk, which was acquired by the Best Western Hotel and Resorts Group in August, provides reservation management software for hotels, accommodation providers, travel agencies and more. Researchers with vpnMentor on Monday said that they discovered an Elasticsearch database, owned by Autoclerk, exposed online that contained over 100,000 booking reservations for travelers.\u201cThe database was hosted by Amazon Web Servers in the USA, containing over 179GB of data,\u201d Noam Rotem and Ran Locar, researchers with vpnMentor, said in a Monday post. \u201cMuch of the data exposed originated from external travel and hospitality platforms using the database owner\u2019s platform to interact with one another. The client platforms affected include property management systems (PMS), booking engines, and data services within the tourism and hospitality industries.\u201dExposed information included unencrypted login credentials, full names, date of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, dates and costs of travel, and masked credit-card details. For certain reservations, after guests checked in to a hotel, their check-in time and room number also was viewable on the database.Because Autoclerk software is used by third-party travel agencies, several external accommodation providers\u2019 customers were impacted by the leak. Platforms whose clients were compromised as part of the leak include HAPI Cloud, OpenTravel and Synxis by Sabre Hospitality Solutions.Disturbingly, one of the platforms exposed in the database was a contractor of the U.S. government, military and Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said researchers. The unnamed contractor manages the travel arrangements of U.S. government and military personnel, as well as independent contractors working with American defense and security agencies.\u201cFor the U.S. government, alarm bells should be ringing,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThe leak exposed the personally identifying information (PII) of personnel and their travel arrangements. Our team viewed logs for U.S. army generals traveling to Moscow, Tel Aviv and many more destinations. We also found their email address, phone numbers and other sensitive personal data.\u201dBeyond the privacy implications of hackers getting their hands on PII of customers, researchers said that the reservation details of customers in the database could provide attackers with valuable clues to piece together fraud or phishing attacks.For instance, if a bad actor knows the booking details (including dates and locations) for a customer, it would be easy to send them an email pretending to be the hotel or booking engine, asking them to hand over further personal information or credit-card data.The database could also have physically dangerous implications for victims, researchers said, especially for potentially high-profile government or military personnel: \u201cWith detailed information on their hotel stays, hackers would know exactly when guests of hotels using the affected PMS and reservations platforms are on holiday, along with their home addresses.\u201dThe database was discovered and reported to U.S. CERT on Sept. 13. Researchers said that U.S. CERT did not respond to the incident disclosure; so they then made contact with a representative of the Pentagon, who ensured the issue would be dealt with. The database was closed on Oct. 2.While they labeled the incident a \u201cbreach,\u201d vpnMentor researchers did not specify whether the database has been accessed by any third parties; they did not respond to a request from Threatpost inquiring about this detail.The incident is just the latest in a string of data leaks that exposed sensitive information to the open internet, including Capital One, where a cybercriminal\u00a0accessed the data of more than 100 million people\u00a0in the U.S. and 6 million in Canada; as well as auto dealership company Dealer Leads and consulting firm Aliznet.Jonathan\u00a0Knudsen, senior security strategist at Synopsys, said in an email that data exposed to the internet with no authentication continues to be a serious problem.\u201cThis incident highlights the need for basic security awareness and education across all industries,\u201d said Knudsen. \u201cEven a basic level of understanding would have made Autoclerk\u2019s deployment team realize the extreme risk of placing so much sensitive information on an unprotected server.\u201dAutoclerk parent Best Western Hotel and Resorts Group did not respond to a request for comment from Threatpost; U.S. CERT also did not respond to a request for comment.What are the top cybersecurity issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "UPDATEUp to 22 Texas entities \u2013 the majority of which are local governments \u2013 were hit by a ransomware attack on Friday that Texas officials say is part of a targeted attack launched by a single threat actor.Details remain scant about the specific agencies hit by the ransomware attacks, which began on the morning of Aug. 16, as well as which systems are impacted. However, the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) as of Saturday night did say that responders are actively working with all entities to bring their systems back online, and that the State of Texas systems and networks are not impacted.While initially the DIR said 23 entities were impacted, as of Tuesday, it reduced that number to 22. Also on Tuesday, DIR said that 25 percent of impacted entities had moved from the \u201cresponse\u00a0and assessment\u201d phase to the \u201cremediation and recovery\u201d phase, with a number of entities back to operations as usual.\u201cCurrently, DIR, the Texas Military Department, and the Texas A&M University System\u2019s Cyberresponse and Security Operations Center teams are deploying resources to the most critically impacted jurisdictions,\u201d according to the DIR in a statement on its website. \u201cFurther resources will be deployed as they are requested.\u201dThe Texas DIR denied comment to Threatpost when questioned about the specific entities impacted \u201cdue to security concerns,\u201d except to say that \u201cthey\u00a0were smaller, local governments.\u201dThe DIR also did not comment on which systems are down, how systems were first infected, and the specific amount of ransom. Threatpost also reached out to representatives from Dallas, Houston and Austin for comment on whether they were impacted by the attack. While representatives from Dallas and Austin have not yet responded, a spokesperson from Houston told Threatpost that \u201cas far as we know, Houston has not been affected.\u201d\u201cThe city of Houston is aware that a ransomware attack has affected several local government agencies throughout Texas,\u201d according to a statement sent to Threatpost. \u201cWe are in contact with the Texas State Operations Center and will monitor the latest developments\u2026.The Mayor\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and the IT Services Department will continue to proactively work to secure and protect the city\u2019s assets.\u201dThe DIR said that at this time, evidence gathered indicates the attacks came from one single threat actor.Allan Liska, threat intel analyst with Recorded Future,\u00a0told Threatpost that the attacks signify an important shift in the ransomware attack model. Typically, state and local governments have been \u201ctargets of opportunity\u201d for ransomware attacks \u2013 with the\u00a0gangs behind Ryuk and SamSam appearing to stumble onto previous state and local governments targets. However, this incident appears to be the first where a string of governments were actively being targeted in an attack.\u201cThis is the first time there\u2019s been an attack against several local governments in a state\u2026 this is big, it\u2019s a gamechanger,\u201d Liska told Threatpost. \u201cThis will change the model going forward [for attackers], and that will be a problem for governments.\u201dOne advantage that Texas has is that it has a consolidated incident response, Liska said\u2013 meaning that the response team is centralized against cities and counties in emergencies: \u201cThat means it\u2019s easier when there is a problem like this to reach out to a main contact,\u201d he said.For more information about ransomware attacks, listen to our Threatpost podcast episode below.Ransomware continues to plague local governments.In June, dual Florida cities \u2013 Lake City and Riviera Beach \u2013 were both hit by ransomware attacks and decided to pay off the hackers. In 2018, several\u00a0Atlanta city systems\u00a0were crippled after a ransomware attack extorted the municipality for $51,000.\u00a0And The city of Baltimore is another\u00a0recent victim\u00a0of\u00a0ransomware, which hit in May and halted some city services like water bills, permits and more, demanding a $76,000 ransom.A\u00a0recent report\u00a0by Recorded Future found that it does appear ransomware attacks on state and local governments is on the rise. In fact, excluding Texas\u2019 most recent incident, Recorded Future has tracked 61 recorded ransomware attacks so far in 2019 (not including Texas). That figure already soars above the 54 ransomware incidents recoded in 2018.\u201cGenerally speaking, we haven\u2019t seen ransomware attacks specifically against state and local governments \u2013 it\u2019s been a growing problem, but we now know that attackers are actively looking for flaws in state and local governments,\u201d said Liska.This story was updated on Tuesday Aug. 20 at 4pm ET with new information about the impacted Texas entities.Interested in more on the internet of things (IoT)?

        "raw text": "A pair of notable hacks on government targets have come to light: One, an attack affecting nearly the entire country of Bulgaria; and two, a hack of Russia\u2019s main security agency (FSB) that represents the largest data heist ever experienced there.In Bulgaria, cybercriminals were able to infiltrate the country\u2019s tax revenue office, lifting personal data of 5 million Bulgarians. Bulgaria has just 7 million people, meaning that almost every adult is impacted. The compromised information includes retirement pension information, addresses, incomes and names, all of which was made available on the internet, according to reports.A National Revenue Agency spokesman offered few details on the attack, though the hack is believed to have happened in June. The Bulgarian Commission for Personal Data Protection said it has launched an investigation into the hack.\u201cAs there is undergoing investigation, we couldn\u2019t provide more details about reasons behind the hack,\u201d agency Communications Director Rossen Bachvarov told CNN.Meanwhile, Kristian Boykov, a 20-year-old Bulgarian cybersecurity worker, was arrested in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia last week in connection to the breach, according to NPR. A police raid saw the seizure of computers and mobile devices with encrypted information. At first, Boykov was charged with a hack against critical infrastructure, with a maximum sentence of eight years in jail. However, the charges were dropped and replaced with the charge of crime against information systems, which carries a maximum jail sentence of three years.The breach wasn\u2019t uncovered until an email from a Russian email address was sent to Bulgarian news outlets last week claiming responsibility for the attack, and mocking Bulgaria\u2019s security as weak. It\u2019s unclear if regulators will find lax security to be the issue, but under the European Union\u2019s GDPR data privacy regulation, the Bulgarian government could face a fine of up to $22.4 million, according to NPR.Meanwhile in Russia, the Federal Security Service (FSB) was in the crosshairs for cybercriminals who made off with 7.5 terabytes of data from one of FSB\u2019s main contractors. The hack revealed several FSB projects aimed at de-anonymizing Tor communications, establish a closed internet for the country and collecting social-media information on citizens. Forbes and other mainstream Western news outlets received sample documents after a hacking group called Digital Revolution went public with the attack via Twitter.\u042d\u0439, \u0424\u0421\u0411, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0443 \u0432\u0430\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u041d\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c-2? \u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0443\u0440\u0448\u043b\u0430\u0433-1? @Dobrokhotov @RuBlackListNET @leonidvolkov @msvetov @shaveddinov @kozlyuk @RuHackersNews @the_ins_ru @tjournal @kmartynov @bbcrussian pic.twitter.com/RjKCFnXWlT\u2014 DigitalRevolution (@D1G1R3V) July 18, 2019The attack, according to BBC Russia, is believed to have happened on July 13, when a group called 0v1ru$, under the Digital revolution umbrella, breached a contractor called SyTech.Attacks on government targets are far from unheard of. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for instance suffered a major data breach in 2006, when personal data of more than 26 million veterans and military personnel were compromised.

        "raw text": "The U.S. Justice Department is looking to retaliate against North Korea-linked hackers who have built up a massive global network of infected computers.The department announced on Wednesday that it would seek to map out the Joanap botnet, which has been built and controlled by North Korea-linked hackers since 2009, and eventually disrupt it by alerting impacted victims.In order to map out Joanap, law enforcement has been operating servers that mimicked peers in the botnet. By pretending to be infected peers, these computers collected \u201climited identifying and technical information\u201d about other infected systems with Joanap (such as IP addresses, port numbers and connection time-stamps).This allows the government to build out a map of the infected systems and warn impacted victims \u2013 in the hopes of eventually eradicating the threat.\u201cComputers around the world remain infected by a botnet associated with the North Korean regime,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Demers, in a statement. \u201cThrough this operation, we are working to eradicate the threat that North Korea state hackers pose to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data. This operation is another example of the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to use every tool at our disposal to disrupt national security threat actors, including, but by no means limited to, prosecution.\u201dThe BotnetAccording to a 2018 US-CERT alert, the Joanap malware has been targeting multiple\u00a0victims globally and in the United States since 2009 \u2014including the media, aerospace, financial and critical infrastructure sectors.Joanap has been targeting computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. Once the hackers gain access to these infected computers, they can carry out other malicious activities from the impacted infrastructure.Joanap, also known as \u201cHidden Cobra,\u201d is a remote access tool that it is dropped on infected systems by the automated Brambul worm, which crawls from computer-to-computer and probes whether it can gain access using certain vulnerabilities.Once installed on an infected computer, Joanap would allow the North Korean hackers to remotely access infected computers, gain root level (or near-total) access to infected computers and load additional malware onto infected computers, the government said.\u201cLike other botnets, Joanap was designed to operate automatically and undetected on victims\u2019 computers,\u201d the government said.\u00a0 \u201cJoanap uses a decentralized peer-to-peer communication system, rather than a centralized mechanism to communicate with and control the peers, such as a command-and-control domain.\u201dMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security urges users and administrators to keep their operating systems and software up-to-date with the latest patches.\u201cMost attacks target vulnerable applications and operating systems,\u201d said\u00a0DHS. \u201cPatching with the latest updates greatly reduces the number of exploitable entry points available to an attacker,.\u201dNorth Korean ImpactJoanap has been tied to the well-known Lazarus Group, (also known as Hidden Cobra) the APT actor behind several wide-scale and damaging cyber attacks including WannaCry and the 2014 Sony Pictures Entertainment hack.The effort follows charges unsealed last year in which the United States charged a North Korean citizen, Park Jin Hyok, a member of a conspiracy backed by the North Korean government that carried out numerous computer intrusions.In September, the DoJ charged Hyok and alleged in its 179-page\u00a0complaint\u00a0that he was involved in \u201ca conspiracy to conduct multiple destructive cyberattacks around the world\u201d as a member of the\u00a0Lazarus Group,Those \u201cdestructive cyberattacks\u201d illustrate just the level of impact that the infamous APT has had globally and in the U.S. over the past few years.They include robbing the Bangladeshi central bank of $81 million; hacking Sony Pictures Entertainment in retaliation for the film The Interview (which featured a parody of DPRK leader Kim Jon-Un); and creating the WannaCry ransomware that impacted victims in more than 150 countries.\u00a0GovernmentMalware",

        "raw text": "As the U.S. federal shutdown continues, dozens of U.S. government websites have been rendered either insecure or inaccessible due to expired transport layer security (TLS) certificates that have not been renewed.In fact, .gov websites\u00a0are using more than 80 TLS certificates that have expired,\u00a0according to a new Thursday report by Netcraft. That\u2019s because funding for renewals has been paused. That opens the impacted sites to an array of cyber-attacks; most notably, man-in the-middle attacks, which allow bad actors to intercept exchanges between a user and a web application\u2014either to eavesdrop or to impersonate the website and steal any data that the user may input.Dozens of sites are impacted, which include sensitive government payment portals and remote access services for organizations like NASA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Court of Appeals.The security issue has raised alarms as the U.S. government continues to be crippled by a partial government shutdown, which as of Friday has been ongoing for 21 days. About 800,000 federal employees are furloughed or temporarily working without pay, and millions more government contractors have been told not to come to work.Click to expand\u201cWith Donald Trump seemingly unwilling to compromise on his demands for a wall along the border with Mexico, and Democrats refusing to approve a budget containing $5.7B for the wall, the hundreds of thousands of unpaid federal employees might not be the only ones hurting,\u201d said Netcraft. \u201cAs more and more certificates used by government websites inevitably expire over the following days, weeks \u2014 or maybe even months \u2014 there could be some realistic opportunities to undermine the security of all U.S. citizens.\u201dOne impacted U.S. website, belonging to the Department of Justice, uses a certificate that expired in the week leading up the shutdown. According to Netcraft, the certificate was signed by trusted certificate authority GoDaddy \u2013 but it has not been renewed since it expired on December 17.Another, the .gov website for Berkeley Lab, expired on January 8 and has not yet been replaced.The issue has sparked concerns in the infosec space about how the sensitive government websites can be abused \u2013 and what other security issues are raised due to the shutdown.\u201cHow many critical governmental systems are currently unmaintained, outdated and thus vulnerable? It seems to be a great opportunity for nation-state hacking groups to exploit U.S.\u2019 momentary weakness to steal or alter extremely sensitive information,\u201d \u00a0High-Tech Bridge\u2019s CEO Ilia Kolochenko said in an email.HSTS PoliciesLuckily, certain security measures were implemented before the shutdown that protects some .gov websites from cyber-attacks when their certificates have expired \u2013 but the downside is that those protected websites can no longer be accessed.Click to expandThe security measure puts certain usdoj.gov domains and any subdomains that are on Chromium\u2019s HSTS preload list, which is a list of sites hard-coded into Chrome as being HTTPS only. \u00a0This security measure prevents users from visiting the HTTPS sites when they have an expired certificate.However, not all sites implement the HSTS policies, and \u201cconsequently, most of the affected sites will display an interstitial security warning that the user will be able to bypass,\u201d Netcraft said. While that means that the websites can at least be accessed, \u201cthis introduces some realistic security concerns, as task-oriented users are more likely to ignore these security warnings, and will therefore render themselves vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\u201dGov Shutdown\u2019s Impact on SecurityAs the government shutdown continues, it has an array of impacts across the board when it comes to security.Fortalice Solutions\u2019 Theresa Payton, the former White House CIO, said that the shutdown has an array of implications for cybersecurity issues across the country, including short-staffing agencies that are working on cybersecurity, spooking cybersecurity professionals who might otherwise be interested in public service or government contracting, and interfering with timelines for contracts.\u201cLeaders and legislators on both sides of the aisle would do well to take an \u2018all-of-the-above\u2019 approach when it comes to this\u00a0shutdown\u00a0and our national security goals,\u201d she told Threatpost.Kolochenko meanwhile said that moving forward, an emergency plan needs to be developed to deal with continuing critical security measures even during a government shutdown.\u201cThe situation\u2026 points to a continuity plan that is poorly implemented in some federal agencies: Critical cybersecurity tasks and processes have to be maintained even if financing is temporarily paused,\u201d Kolochenko said. \u201cOtherwise, the entire model of governmental cybersecurity is questionable, and people may reasonably inquire where do their taxes go.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0GovernmentWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The U.S. government and the state of California are butting heads over a newly-passed state law that enforces net neutrality regulations on internet service providers (ISPs). And experts say that the outcome of the feud between federal and state law has long-standing implications for the future of net neutrality.Senate Bill 822, passed into law on Sunday, was first introduced in March by Sen. Scott Wiener (D.-San Francisco), and mandates a thorough set of regulations on ISPs ensuring they don\u2019t discriminate against various types of content. Wiener said in a tweet that the newly-signed bill \u201ccontains the strongest net-neutrality protections in the nation.\u201dNET NEUTRALITY IS NOW THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA!Governor Brown just signed our #SB822, which contains the strongest #NetNeutrality protections in the nation. Huge win for an open internet. Thank you @JerryBrownGov! pic.twitter.com/mZa8l9qc16\u2014 Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) October 1, 2018The bill prevents internet providers from blocking, throttling or discriminating against any Internet content. The rules are similar to those approved by the Federal Communications Commission during the Obama era, known as the Open Internet Order, which were passed in 2015 and repealed last December amid much controversy.California\u2019s newly-passed legislation contains other features that make it an even stronger law around net neutrality than the former FCC approach, including prohibiting \u201czero rating,\u201d which would enable carriers to control which types of content would count towards a customers\u2019 data usage \u2013 including their own streaming services or content.But as soon as the California bill passed, the Department of Justice promptly hit back with a lawsuit alleging that its regulations are unlawful.\u201cI\u2019m pleased the Department of Justice has filed this suit,\u201d FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cThe internet is inherently an interstate information service. As such, only the federal government can set policy in this area. And the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit recently reaffirmed that state regulation of information services is preempted by federal law.\u201dThe 2015 net neutrality regulations have been opposed by large ISPs like Comcast, AT&T and Verizon (which all also have streaming content subsidiaries). They, like Pai, argue for a market-based approach and claim that regulation is overreach.\u201cNot only is California\u2019s internet regulation law illegal, it also hurts consumers,\u201d said Pai. \u201cThe law prohibits many free-data plans, which allow consumers to stream video, music and the like, exempt from any data limits.\u201dBut Katharine Trendacosta, policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argues that the law was written to be within state power.\u201cThe argument that the FCC preempted states acting to protect the net neutrality within their\u00a0borders doesn\u2019t hold a lot of water when the FCC gave up jurisdiction of this area in the so-called \u2018Restoring Internet Freedom Order,'\u201d she told Threatpost. \u201cYou can\u2019t throw up your hands, walk away and say it\u2019s not your problem anymore, only to also say no one else can rush in to solve that problem. You gave up that right when you walked away.\u201dFederal-Level MeasuresThere is also a federal effort to reinstate net neutrality. Earlier this year, the U.S. senate voted in May to reverse the FCC repeal of net neutrality laws.However, to pass, the effort still needs to win a majority (or 218 votes) in a House where Republicans dominate; and to get a signature from President Donald Trump, who supports the FCC\u2019s action. Thus, the repeal still has a ways to go. As of June, the measure is still 46 signatures away from a House win, according to a tweet by Sen. Ed Markey (D.-Mass.).Furthermore, with the 2018 midterm elections looming in November, these efforts may be seen merely as a political move to rally both parties.California also isn\u2019t the first state to amp up its efforts around net neutrality. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, legislators in 30 states have introduced over 72 bills requiring internet service providers to ensure various net neutrality principles.So far, governors in six states \u2013 including Hawaii, New Jersey, New York and Vermont \u2013 have signed executive orders around net neutrality, while three states (Oregon, Vermont and Washington) have enacted net-neutrality legislation.Another proposed California legislative effort, Senate Bill 460, also proposes prohibiting ISPs in the state from taking certain actions regarding the accessing of content on the internet by customers. That bill remains pending.However, California\u2019s scope and size give the recent ruling powerful significance in terms of what it means for national versus state restrictions on critical tech, security and privacy issues.\u201cSB 822 also resonates outside California\u2019s borders,\u201d said Barbara van Schewick, \u00a0professor of law at Stanford University and the director of Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, in a recent analysis. \u201cWhen California acts, the rest of the country \u2014 and the world \u2014 often follows. As the largest state in the nation and the fifth largest economy in the world, California has long been at the forefront of forward-looking policy. As the home to many of the world\u2019s most important Internet companies and the most vibrant innovation ecosystem in the world, California needed to restore net neutrality to protect its economy.\u201dGovernmentWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Details on more than 14 million customer records have been exposed thanks to a security oversight at GovPayNow.com, which as its name implies provides a platform for online payment systems for state and local governments.The company, which according to its website \u201chandles more than 2.1 million payments annually to more than 2,600 agencies in 36 states reaching more than 26 percent of all U.S. counties\u201d has leaked names, addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of the payment cards for citizens that have paid online for everything from traffic tickets to bail to permitting fees.The breach covers data stretching back six years.According to security researcher Brian Krebs, the issue revolved around GovPayNow\u2019s online payment receipt URLs \u2013 each customer was presented with a unique confirmation page after a transaction. But the addresses for these pages were static, consisting of a common web address with a unique set of numbers at the end for each receipt \u2014 so someone only had to type in different receipt digits in the web address to pull up different receipts. Even just guessing the digits gave adversaries a good chance of getting a \u201chit.\u201dThe company fixed the problem over the weekend, it said. It\u2019s unclear whether bad actors actually accessed the information \u2013 and there\u2019s likely no way of knowing.For its part, GovPayNet issued a statement: \u201c[We have] addressed a potential issue with our online system that allows users to access copies of their receipts, but did not adequately restrict access only to authorized recipients. The company has no indication that any improperly accessed information was used to harm any customer, and receipts do not contain information that can be used to initiate a financial transaction. Additionally, most information in the receipts is a matter of public record that may be accessed through other means. Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution and to maximize security for users, GovPayNet has updated this system to ensure that only authorized users will be able to view their individual receipts. We will continue to evaluate security and access to all systems and customer records.\u201dDespite the company\u2019s insinuation that the issue provides little danger to consumers financially, there are threat vectors that the information could be used for.\u201cWhile it may be technically true that the receipts \u2018do not contain information that can be used to initiate a financial transaction,\u2019 the most common usage of this kind of leaked data is to take over access to online accounts, either through the call center or through password reset processes, and then use the taken over account to commit financial fraud,\u201d Nishant Kaushik, CTO at Uniken, told Threatpost.Further, the issue indicates that the company persisted in relying on outdated security practices, and may be non-compliant with PCI standards, according to Terry Ray, CTO of Imperva.\u201cThese are basic web application coding practices that I\u2019ve seen since the early 2000s and should not happen,\u201d he said via email. \u201cIn the early days of the 2000s\u2026I found even some banks would use sequential account numbers without validation on their web applications returning very similar results. Most of these were corrected more than a decade ago.\u201dHe added, \u201cGiven that GovPayNow.com is a managed payment gateway providing online electronic payment services for third-party web sites and has a PCI DSS stamp on their web page, I know they have completed at least one Payment Card Industry (PCI) audit. These audits are supposed to verify that companies taking and storing credit-card information perform \u2018routine\u2019 code and vulnerability reviews on their applications. This particular problem would not likely have presented as a vulnerability in most cases, but should have presented under poor coding practices. The most recent versions of the PCI regulation further requires that where web application problems and vulnerabilities are found, they must be corrected.\u201dBreachGovernmentPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The OilRig group is back, using a reboot of the OopsIE trojan to pump information from its favorite resource: entities in the Middle East region.OilRig, which is also called Cobalt Gypsy, Crambus, Helix Kitten or PT34, is suspected of having ties to Iran. The group was identified in 2015 and is believed to be linked to the Iranian Intelligence agency and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). They\u2019re known for attacking energy, financial, aviation, infrastructure, government and university organizations, primarily in the Middle East.The group has a history of not reinventing the wheel. It tends to use new iterations of previously identified tools and tactics to carry out its activities, according to Palo Alto\u2019s Unit 42. That\u2019s the case in the latest effort, which Unit 42 uncovered while investigating a separate spear phishing campaign.While looking at the first effort, the firm discovered a second campaign going after a different governmental entity in the same country \u2014 mounted from the same infrastructure. This secondary email, written in Arabic, uses a \u201cbusiness continuity management training\u201d lure in the subject line, which looked to be the result of reconnaissance work. The targeted organization had publicly published several documents regarding that exact subject on the web.The email contained a malicious attachment that Palo Alto identified as a variant of the data-exfiltration OopsIE trojan, first identified in February 2018. However, the new version has been significantly enhanced with better stealth measures.\u201cIn this iteration of OopsIE, the general functionality largely remained the same but contained the addition of anti-analysis and anti-virtual machine capabilities to further evade detection from automated defensive systems,\u201d the researchers explained in an analysis posted Tuesday. They added that after going through a series of anti-VM and sandbox checks, if any are successful, the trojan will exit without running any of its functional code.Further interesting enhancements include a CPU temperature check used by GravityRAT to enhance stealth, and a time-zone check; in the latter, the trojan aborts its mission if the system does not have a specific time zone set that corresponds to Iran, Israel, Saudi Arabia or a handful of other locations in the Middle East, indicating a high degree of targeting.The move marks an advancement in sophistication for OilRig, which started off as a fairly unsophisticated player before going on to become a top APT active in the Mideast, according to researchers. It\u2019s carried out some very interesting attacks, such as the one using a persona named Mia Ash, who was used to catfish \u00a0men working in desirable positions at energy-sector firms with the goal of dropping the PupyRAT remote access tool onto their unsuspecting desktops.\u201cThe OilRig group remains a persistent adversary in the Middle East region,\u201d Unit 42 researchers said. \u201cThey continue to iterate and add capabilities to their tools while still functionally using the same tactics over and over again. Within the time frame we have been tracking the OilRig group, they have repeatedly shown a willingness to add less commonly found functionality to their tools, such as their heavy use of DNS tunneling in their backdoors or adding authentication to their webshells. This attack is no different, now adding anti-analysis capabilities into their tools. This adversary is highly resourceful and continues to adapt over time.\u201dMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Citing security concerns, Sen. Ron Wyden is urging the government to create a plan to transition away from Adobe Flash before the vendor stops supporting it in 2020.To that end, the Oregon Democrat delivered a formal request to the National Security Agency and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to mandate a ban on Flash, via an open\u00a0letter sent Wednesday\u00a0(PDF) to the agencies.\u201cFlash is widely acknowledged by technical experts to be plagued by serious, largely unfixable cybersecurity issues that could allow attackers to completely take control of a vistor\u2019s computer, reaching deep into their digital life,\u201d Wyden wrote.In 2020, in collaboration with\u00a0Apple,\u00a0Facebook,\u00a0Google,\u00a0Microsoft\u00a0and\u00a0Mozilla, Adobe will retire the\u00a0much maligned Flash Player. Open standards such as HTML5, WebGL and WebAssembly will replacing Flash after it is phased out of use, and Adobe will no longer provide security updates.Wyden pointed out that that the government has \u201ctoo often failed to promptly transition away from software that has been decommissioned.\u201dSpecifically, Windows XP is one example of a lack of modernization at the federal level: According to the senator, the U.S. government has spent \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d for premium after-life support for the operating system since Microsoft retired it in April 2014.Wyden is calling for a government mandate that will require agencies to cease deploying Flash-based content, and to remove Flash-based content from their websites, by Aug. 1, 2019. He is also calling for the creation of a small pilot program that removes Flash from government employee desktops by March 1 of next year.For more than a decade, the ubiquitous Flash player has been a favorite target for attacks; the typical gambit involves browser pop-ups that trick users into installing and running a bogus Flash player, which turns out to actually be malware.\u00a0Flash has been also abused by hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the legitimate Flash player; its appeal lies in the fact that a single Flash exploit could target multiple browsers, since most of them support the program.Despite progress in hardening its attack surface, Flash security holes still dominate the threat landscape. Since 2005, it has amassed over 1,050 unique CVE entries. That\u2019s\u00a0more than Windows XP or Internet Explorer, according\u00a0to\u00a0CVEDetails.com.Last year alone, there were 71 unique CVEs associated with Flash, with 56 of them rated critical and allowing attackers to remotely execute code. Just this month,\u00a0Adobe patched two Flash bugs \u2013 a critical arbitrary code execution bug (CVE-2018-5007) and an important information disclosure out-of-bounds read bug (CVE-2018-5008).This state of affairs is only set to get worse once Adobe ceases support for the player. Like Windows XP, Flash is likely to live on in legacy installations across the web for years, perhaps decades, to come, and more vulnerabilities are sure to surface. After 2020 though, there won\u2019t be patches for newly discovered flaws, which will turn Flash into a wide-open doorway into networks for cybercriminals.\u201cThe U.S. government should begin transitioning away from Flash immediately, before it is abandoned in 2020,\u201d Wyden wrote.GovernmentVulnerabilities",

The backdoor BS2005 \u2013 which has traditionally been used by the group \u2013 now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS,\u201d according to the NCC Group report on the attack.Researchers at FireEye had previously analyzed BS2005 in 2013, which was used by APT15 to target European diplomats and ministries of foreign affairs.\u00a0NCC Group\u2019s examination of the reused code in each of the backdoor samples allowed researchers to connect the dots, asserting that the backdoors were linked to the same threat actor, APT15 (also known as K3chang, Mirage, Vixen Panda, GREF and Playful Dragon).It\u2019s unclear what the group\u2019s initial entry point was into the network, however researchers believe that the adversary used a bevy of tools starting with the open-source tool Mimikatz tool that was used to gain domain administrator credentials, \u201caiding them in later stealing a VPN certificate which they used to access the victim\u2019s network remotely\u201d and ultimately installing the backdoors.Researchers said the group also used the backdoors in tandem with Windows command prompt cmd.exe to carry out further commands and drop various additional tools on infected systems.\u201cAll of the backdoors identified \u2013 excluding RoyalDNS \u2013 required APT15 to create batch scripts in order to install its persistence mechanism. This was achieved through the use of a simple Windows run key. We believe that APT15 could have employed this technique in order to evade behavioral detection, rather than due to a lack of sophistication or development capability,\u201d said NCC Group\u2019s report.Researchers said additional tools were used by the group including\u00a0archiving tool WinRAR, a Microsoft SharePoint tool known as \u201cspwebmember\u201d and an unidentified\u00a0network scanning/enumeration tool. \u201cThe group also used keyloggers and their own .NET tool to enumerate folders and dump data from Microsoft Exchange mailboxes,\u201d researchers said.\u201cSpwebmember was written in Microsoft .NET and includes hardcoded values for client project names for data extraction. The tool would connect to the SQL SharePoint database and issue a query to dump all data from the database to a temporary file affixed with \u2018spdata,'\u201d according to NCC Group\u2019s report.\u201cOnce inside the victim\u2019s network, the group was able to extract and collect information in multiple ways. The group used a tool called Comma Separated Value Data Exchange (CSVDE), which can export data in bulk from Microsoft Windows Active Directory, as well as Bulk Copy Program (BCP), which comes with Microsoft SQL, to export data from Microsoft SQL databases,\u201d according to NCC Group.Researchers observed over 200 commands executed by the attacker against the compromised hosts leading them to believe the threat actor is highly sophisticated and at the same time had \u201cno problem writing tools which are specific to its victims.\u201d\u201cAnalysis of the commands executed by APT15 reaffirmed the group\u2019s preference to \u2018live off the land\u2019. They utilised Windows commands in order to enumerate and conduct reconnaissance activities such as tasklist.exe, ping.exe, netstat.exe, net.exe, systeminfo.exe, ipconfig.exe and bcp.exe,\u201d wrote researchers.When NCC Group initially discovered APT15, they ejected the group from the victim\u2019s network, However, a few weeks later, APT15 later managed to regain access through the corporate VPN solution using a VPN certificate stolen from a compromised host \u2013 and this time, the group was using a newer backdoor \u2013 RoyalDNS.The RoyalDNS backdoor takes commands, runs them, and returns output using domain name system (DNS) \u2013 installing itself and communicating on DNS rather than HTTP, unlike the other two backdoors.\u00a0NCC Group said that both RoyalCLI and BS2005 communicate with the attacker\u2019s command and control (C2) through Internet Explorer (IE) by using the COM interface IWebBrowser2 \u2013 meaning that C2 data is cached to the desk by the IE process.APT15 has surfaced over the past years, and has been tied to attacks including the TidePool malware attack used in an ongoing campaign against Indian embassy personnel globally in 2016, and the BS2005 attack targeting European diplomats and ministries of foreign affairs discovered in 2013.\u201cKnowledge sharing in the security industry is vital in order to improve the security posture and capabilities of the sector and UK as a whole. Discussing these types of insights is therefore necessary to ensure that we\u2019re always able to understand and adapt to an ever-increasing variety of threats,\u201d Ahmed Zaki, senior malware researcher at NCC Group, said in the report.GovernmentHacksSecurity Analyst SummitVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "More than 4,200 websites, including many run the U.K. and U.S. governments, were infected on Feb. 11 by a Monero cryptocurrency miner delivered through Browsealoud, a hosted accessibility service that can read website content aloud for people with visual impairments.Browsealoud developer Texthelp has taken the service offline temporarily while it works on a fix. The exploit was active for four hours and Texthelp had been preparing for such an attack for a while, CTO and data security officer Martin McKay said in a statement.\u201cTexthelp has in place continuous automated security tests for Browsealoud, and these detected the modified file and as a result the product was taken offline,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis removed Browsealoud from all our customer sites immediately, addressing the security risk without our customers having to take any action.\u201dNo customer data was compromised or lost, and an investigation is underway, according to McKay. A list of the affected websites, which stands at 4,275, is available here.The infection was first reported by security researcher Scott Helme. A friend of Helme\u2019s told him that his antivirus software was issuing a warning when he visited the site of the U.K. Information Commissioner\u2019s office, prompting Helme to investigate.\u201cThey\u2019re the people we complain to when companies do bad things with our data,\u201d Helme wrote. \u201cIt was pretty alarming to realize that they were running a crypto miner on their site, their whole site, every single page. \u2026 I quickly realized though that this script, whilst present on the ICO website, was not being hosted by the ICO, it was included by a 3rd party library they loaded.\u201dThat turned out to be Browsealoud, which had been compromised by attackers that altered one of its hosted JavaScript files, Helme said.\u201cThis is not a particularly new attack and we\u2019ve known for a long time that CDNs or other hosted assets are a prime target to compromise a single target and then infect potentially many thousands of websites,\u201d Helme added.The attack could have been averted if the sites had employed a simple technique called subresource integrity, Helme said. This tells web browsers to run an integrity check on anything being loaded from a third-party source.Helme explained the technique in a previous blog post.\u201cBy embedding the base64 encoded cryptographic hash digest that we expect for the asset into the script or link tag, the browser can download the asset and check its cryptographic hash digest against the one it was expecting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf the hash of the downloaded asset matches the hash that we provided, then the content is what we were expecting to receive and the browser can safely include the script or style. If the hash doesn\u2019t match then we know we can\u2019t trust the data and it must be discarded.\u201dIt\u2019s not clear how much Monero the managed to generate, but crypto mining schemes have been coming into vogue among cybercriminals. The Smominru botnet, which infected more than half a million machines, has made up to $3.6 million worth of Monero since May, Proofpoint reported.Last week, a Monero botnet showed up in China and South Korea, infecting Android devices through port 5555, which is associated with the OS\u2019s Debug Bridge tool.\u00a0HacksVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers at Authomize have discovered four \u201chigh impact\u201d security risks in the identity and access management (IAM) platform Okta, according to a Tuesday report.The risks include cleartext password leakage via SCIM \u2013 the System for Cross-domain Identity Management \u2013 sharing of passwords and other data over unencrypted HTTP channels, default configurations which allow admins to invade other organizations\u2019 IT environments, and mutable identity log spoofing.Attackers who take advantage of these risks could steal authentication data, access sensitive personal and financial information and disrupt Okta-managed IT environments.The Risks in IAMIAM software organizes which individuals have access to which resources in an IT environment. Platforms like Okta also offer features like password management and single sign-on, allowing users to more seamlessly login and move from one software environment to another. In all, IAMs are quite convenient for users and administrators alike.However, an insecure IAM is convenient for attackers for many of the same reasons. The newly discovered risks in Okta could allow hackers or malicious insiders to obtain passwords, take over administrator accounts, or even destroy an entire organization\u2019s data.Take, for example, the third risk outlined in the report.For global and distributed organizations, Okta utilizes a hub and spoke architecture, where the parent company (\u201chub\u201d) oversees and provides services for the smaller independent businesses (\u201cspokes\u201d) it controls. What the researchers discovered is that an admin in an Okta spoke \u201ccan impersonate any account in the hub and/or a downstream app connected to the hub.\u201d The report lays out how this might occur, hypothetically:A small company was acquired by a large Fortune 500. The corporation connected the small company\u2019s Okta as a spoke to their main Okta which acts as their hub with the default configuration. A compromised admin from the acquired company\u2019s spoke gains super admin privileges throughout their Okta hub by impersonating a super admin, and therefore achieves full, unlimited access to the corporate\u2019s entire collection of apps and services.The small company\u2019s administrator could access other businesses\u2019 IT environments \u2013 including the one belonging to the large Fortune 500 itself \u2013 to steal or destroy sensitive data, or leverage the data to do just about anything else.Are These Vulnerabilities?The researchers were careful to characterize their findings as \u201crisks,\u201d rather than outright vulnerabilities. When they reached out to Okta, Okta explained that \u201cthe features are performing as designed and should not be categorized as vulnerabilities.\u201d How could that be?Consider our earlier example. The small company admin can obtain unauthorized access to the hub and other spokes by creating a user with the same identifier as an admin in the hub. That two users in a giant hub and spoke environment can have the same username \u201cis intentional and meant to make it easier to scale access controls across the organization while limiting the scope of control to a specific spoke.\u201d However, in practice, they expose the hub to any rogue admin.Okta offers a way to turn off username duplication, but \u201cthese controls are not set by default, making the user potentially insecure from the initial settings. Okta also does little in their guide to explain to their users that they may be at significant risk from these insecure default settings.\u201d\u201cOkta has very good security practices in many areas,\u201d the researchers noted, adding that \u201cwe are sure similar issues exist in other IAM providers.\u201d So, in concluding their study, \u201cour recommendation is that organizations take a proactive approach to implement independent security solutions for their IAM tools.\u201dPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Malware used in a crippling cyberattacks against an Iranian steel plants last week is connected to an attack that shut down the country\u2019s rail system last year. In both cases, on malware strain was used to impact physical and critical infrastructure, according to a report from Check Point Research.The overlaps in the code, combined with contextual clues and even recycled jokes, indicate that the same threat actor, dubbed Indra, is behind the attacks impacting Iran\u2019s infrastructure.Alleged MotivesOn June 27, a steel billet production line at the Khuzestan Steel Corporation began to malfunction. According to reports, sparks flew sparking a fire in the heart of the plant.In a statement to the press, Khuzestan Steel\u2019s CEO denied that any damage had been done.\u201cWith timely action and vigilance the attack failed and no damage was done to the production line,\u201d the company said in a statement.A video posted to Twitter under the username @GonjeshkeDarand claimed responsibility for the both attacks. The video purported to show footage from inside the steel factory. A message was included explaining the attackers\u2019 motives:\u201cThese companies are subject to international sanctions and continue their operations despite the restrictions. These cyber attacks, being carried out carefully so to protect innocent individuals, are in response to the aggression of the Islamic Republic.\u201dLast year \u2013 on the morning of Friday, July 9 \u2013 Iran\u2019s national railway system came under attack. On information boards at stations across the country, hackers posted messages about delays and cancellations that didn\u2019t actually exist. (Those messages themselves caused delays, as confusion swept through the commuter crowds.) Check Point attributed that disruption to Indra, a group that\u2019s been active since 2019.Connecting This Week to Last YearIn both the steel and railway attacks, the perpetrators posted a notice instructing victims and passengers to call a certain phone number. That number belongs to the office of the Ayatollah Khamenei, according to Check Point.Check Point claims it has overlaps between the malware used in both campaigns.An executable (chaplin.exe) discovered in last week\u2019s attack is a variant of malware identified as meteor, a wiper strain believed used in last year\u2019s attack against Iran\u2019s railway system. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that both variants share a codebase,\u201d according to researchers. The malware was dubbed separately as chaplin.Even without a wiper, the malware is potent. \u201cIt begins its execution by disconnecting the network adapters, logging off the user, and executing another binary in a new thread,\u201d the researchers tweeted. The binary \u201cforces the display to be ON and blocks the user from interacting with the computer.\u201d After completely blocking the victim from their own computer\u2019s operation, Chaplin displays the hackers\u2019 message onscreen and \u201cdeletes the \u201cLsa\u201d registry key, preventing the system from booting correctly.\u201dThe investigation into last Monday\u2019s attacks is still ongoing.Register Now for this LIVE EVENT on MONDAY JULY 11: Join Threatpost and Intel Security\u2019s Tom Garrison in a live conversation about innovation enabling stakeholders to stay ahead of a dynamic threat landscape and what Intel Security learned from their latest study in partnership with Ponemon Institue.

        "raw text": "Costco has discovered a payment card skimming device at one of its retail stores and has sent out notification letters informing customers that their card data may have been ripped off if they shopped there recently.Some customers have been aware for weeks that something was fishy and have been sharing their suspicions on social media.Immediately after finally renewing my Costco membership online this morning I discovered $2200 of fraudulent credit card charges made in the UK on August 31st.  So now I have a Costco membership but no credit card to use to shop there for the next seven to nine business days. pic.twitter.com/oBUE9NbMsC\u2014 Ms. Lutzmann (@MsLutzmann) September 4, 2021Reddit post.Reddit post.The story was first picked up by BleepingComputer, which reported that the notification letters went out sometime this month.\u201cWe recently discovered a payment card skimming device at a Costco warehouse you recently visited. Our member records indicate that you swiped your payment card to make a purchase at the affected terminal during the time the device may have been operating,\u201d Costco said in the letter.Register now for our LIVE event!Costco workers removed the device, notified the authorities and is working with law enforcement as they investigate the incident.Costco said that it found the skimmer during a routine inspection of its PIN pads.The retailer is recommending that customers check their credit and/or bank statements for suspicious transactions. Costco is also offering victims IDX identity theft protection services, which provide 12 months of credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy and ID theft recovery services.Big-Box Big Banana Taken In by Bogus Little BoxBest known as simply Costco or Costco Wholesale, Costco Wholesale Corporation is an American, multinational corporation that runs a chain of membership-only big-box stores. As of 2021, the National Retail Federation had rated the big-box behemoth as the sixth-largest retailer in the world.Costco didn\u2019t go into detail about what type of skimmer it found, but it sounds like it was old-school, as in, a physical gadget glommed on top of a regular card scanner so that a payment-card thief can intercept card details from their magnetic strips, then use the details to imprint fresh, new, fraudulent cards.That\u2019s opposed to digital skimmers, which steal payment card info from e-commerce websites via browsers. A recent example was a new Magecart threat actor, detected by the Sansec Threat Research Team, that was stealing people\u2019s payment card info from their browsers using a digital skimmer that was using a unique form of evasion to bypass virtual machines (VMs) in order to avoid targeting (and thereby alerting) security researchers.Detecting a Skimmer: The Wiggle-Jiggle MethodSkimming devices are often disguised and simply laid on top of the existing machine, attached with double-sided tape or another adhesive. Erich Kron, security awareness advocate for KnowBe4, told Threatpost that they typically cover the keypad and the card swipe area and are very hard to see.\u201cThe skimmers typically have an additional set of card readers that saves the magnetic stripe information and records the PIN entry that can be retrieved later from a distance, using Bluetooth or other wireless technologies,\u201d he said, noting that we can expect to see such low-cost skimmers in use more often\u201d as consumers hit the streets making purchases for the holiday season.\u201dHe recommended looking carefully at the card readers and giving them a wiggle to see if the top feels loose. Also, keep a eye out for pens that don\u2019t fit back into the device: \u201cBecause skimmer overlays have to be slightly larger than the card reader itself, they will often make it impossible to put the signature pen back in the slot on the side,\u201d Kron said.And, of course, the standard operating procedure applies when checking out your credit card and bank statements: Keep an eye out for unknown or unusual charges, and report them to your financial institution immediately.Of course, it\u2019s much easier to detect thieves\u2019 attempts to get at your credit card when they\u2019ve gone the kludgy, model airplane route. All your jiggling won\u2019t detect a skimmer that\u2019s installed internally, though.To wit, years ago, there was a spate of Bluetooth-enabled, banking-data-gobbling skimmers installed at gas stations in the Southern US. Eventually, 13 alleged thieves were charged with forging bank cards using banking details chirped out via Bluetooth to nearby crooks from devices that were impossible for gasoline-buying customers to detect, given that the skimmers were installed internally.And as far as digital skimmers go, the problem has grown so acute that in March, Cloudflare created a web security tool to prevent Magecart-style attacks.Physical Data Theft? How QuaintRandy Watkins, Chief Technology Officer at Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services provider CRITICALSTART, told Threatpost on Friday that the type of physical data theft that Costco reported is \u201ctypically very isolated.\u201d\u201cCard skimming devices are used on everything from gas pumps to ATMs, and are typically isolated, only posing a threat to patrons of the breached device,\u201d he said via email. The data that the attacker can steal from a card\u2019s magnetic strip actually depends on the card itself, he said.\u201cWhile things like the credit card number, full name, expiration and country code [are] universal, other cards can contain additional information like billing address or rewards account numbers,\u201d Watkins added. He advised that consumers make a habit of checking card slots for any foreign devices (internal or external) before swiping their card \u2013 though, again, that won\u2019t help with internally installed, Bluetooth-enabled devices.Kludgy or no, devices that physically steal data can cause a world of hurt, particularly at a busy, busy retail store like Costco. \u201cIt\u2019s sobering how much damage a single credit card skimmer can do at a high traffic location like a retail register that may process nearly a hundred credit cards per day,\u201d noted Chris Clements, VP of Solutions Architecture at Cerberus Sentinel.\u201cIf undetected for even a month, it can compromise thousands of credit cards,\u201d he told Threatpost via email on Friday.Clements called out the fact that Costco didn\u2019t say how often it does point-of-sale terminal checks like the one that detected this skimmer, but even just one skimmer can cause a lot of damage. As such \u201cretail organizations need to make it a frequent procedure,\u201d he recommended.\u201cMany skimming devices have become scarily small and advanced, making detection hard for both consumers and retail staff alike. \u2018Shimmers,\u2019 or devices used to clone chip-based credit cards, are extremely small and thin, and can be nearly impossible to spot without disassembling the reader completely,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are specialized tools that retail organizations can look to for more easy and accurate detection of skimmers.\u201dKudos to Costco for Letting Customers KnowKnowBe4\u2019s Kron gave Costco a gold star for letting customers know about the skimmer find. \u201cIn many cases, especially when skimmers are found on retail credit card processing machines or in gas pumps, the victims are never made aware that they are likely victims,\u201d he said in an email to Threatpost. \u201cCostco has really gone above and beyond by notifying their customers that they may have been a victim, allowing them to check their bank account or credit card statements for fraudulent activity.\u201dIt\u2019s particularly prudent given that Costco doesn\u2019t accept all major credit cards, Kron said, meaning that many members have to process the payment as a debit card. That means the crooks can get their hands on both the card number and the PIN number.Cybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging. OSquery and CloudQuery is a solid answer.

        "raw text": "Mozilla Corporation is launching a premium version of the Firefox browser that will tout improved security features such as virtual private network and secure cloud storage, according to CEO Chris Beard.In a Friday interview with German media publication T3N, Beard said that the premium service, with a monthly subscription plan, is currently being developed and will be launched in the fall, potentially as soon as October. Mozilla confirmed the premium service in an email to Threatpost but did not detail pricing, availability or any features.\u201cWe were founded on the belief that the internet should be open and accessible to all. A high-performing, free and private-by-default Firefox browser will continue to be central to our core service offerings,\u201d Dave Camp, senior vice president of Firefox said in a statement sent to Threatpost. \u201cWe also recognize that there are consumers who want access to premium offerings, and we can serve those users too without compromising the development and reach of the existing products and services that Firefox users know and love.\u201dMozilla Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation; While the Mozilla Foundation is a non-profit that runs Mozilla Corporation and \u201coversees Mozilla\u2019s governance structure,\u201d\u00a0the corporation in turn is a taxable entity that\u00a0handles the revenue-related operations of the Mozilla Foundation.The subscription service would open a steady new income stream for Mozilla Corporation; currently, around 90 percent of sales for the Mozilla Corporation are coming from royalties earned through Firefox web browser search partnerships \u2013 and 10 percent from Pocket, a company that discovers and curates content, according to Beard.Part of the premium offer could include a virtual private network (VPN) service, according to Beard. VPN, an online service and piece of software that work together to secure users\u2019 internet connection against monitoring and eavesdropping, prevents internet service providers from tracking which websites users visit.That means users could stay secure on a public Wi-Fi if they wanted to utilize tools like online banking, for instance.\u00a0When asked what a premium offer could look like, Beard told T3N:\u201cWe also tested VPN. We can tell if you\u2019re on a public Wi-Fi network and want to do online banking and say, \u2018Wow, you really should use VPN.\u2019 You can imagine we\u2019ll offer a solution that gives us all a certain amount of free VPN Bandwidth and then offer a premium level over a monthly subscription. We want to add more subscription services to our mix and focus more on the relationship with the user to become more resilient in business issues.\u201dAnother potential premium feature could be a secure cloud storage solution, Beard mentioned.Mozilla has been exploring areas of user demand and testing some service offerings since last year. That includes a partnership with ProtonVPN\u00a0last year as part of an experimental subscription service (costing $10 a month) to enable VPN for its browser.While other security enhancements to the premium service are still unknown, the Mozilla Foundation has buffed up privacy measures for the regular, non-premium version of its\u00a0Firefox\u00a0browser over the past year. For instance the browser has recently received updates to add security and privacy tools that help with password management and help block sites that track users \u2013 such as an \u201cEnhanced Tracking Protection\u201d feature that blocks over 1,000 third-party companies that track online activity and personal information.

        "raw text": "Application service provider F5 is warning a critical vulnerability allows unauthenticated hackers with network access to execute arbitrary commands on its BIG-IP systems.The F5 BIG-IP is a combination of software and hardware that is designed around access control, application availability and security solutions.The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2022-1388 \u00a0with a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10 by the Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.90.\nAccording to F5, the flaw resides in the representational state transfer (REST) interface for the iControl framework which is used to communicate between the F5 devices and users.Threat actors can send undisclosed requests and leverage the flaw to bypass the iControl REST authentication and access the F5 BIG-IP systems, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands, create or delete files or disable servers.\u201cThis vulnerability may allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the BIG-IP system through the management port and/or self IP addresses to execute arbitrary system commands, create or delete files, or disable services,\u201d said F5 in an advisory. \u201cThere is no data plane exposure; this is a control plane issue only,\u201d they added.A self-IP address is an IP address on a BIG-IP system, that a customer uses to associate with VLAN.The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert and advised users to apply the required updates.Affected VersionsThe security vulnerability that affects the BIG-IP product version are:1.0 to 16.1.21.0 to 15.1.51.0 to 14.1.41.0 to 13.1.41.0 to 12.1.66.1 to 11.6.5The F5 will not introduce fixes for versions 11.x (11.6.1 \u2013 11.6.5) and 12.x (12.1.0 \u2013 12.1.6).The patches for versions v17.0.0, v16.1.2.2, v15.1.5.1, v14.1.4.6, and v13.1.5 were introduced by F5.The advisory by F5 clarifies that the CVE-2022-1388 has no effect on other F5 products \u2013 BIG-IQ Centralized Management, F5OS-A, F5OS-C, or Traffic SDC.F5 affected products and fixed versions (Source: F5)The BIG-IP devices are commonly integrated into the enterprises there is a significant threat of widespread attack.Security researcher Nate Warfield reported in a tweet that nearly 16,000 BIG-IP devices are exposed to the internet. A query shared by Warfield shows the exposed devices on Shodan.Most of the exposed BIG-IP devices are located in the USA, China, India, and Australia. These systems are allocated to Microsoft corporation, Google LLC, DigitalOcean, and Linode.MitigationsThree \u201ctemporary mitigation\u201d methods were advised by F5, for those who can\u2019t deploy security patches immediately.According to F5 \u201cYou can block all access to the iControl REST interface of your BIG-IP system through self IP addresses\u201d. This can be done by changing the Port Lockdown settings to Allow None for each self-IP address in the system.Another mitigation method is to restrict iControl REST access through the management interface or modify the BIG-IP httpd configuration.Additionally, F5 has also released a more generic advisory to tackle another set of 17 high severity vulnerabilities discovered and fixed in BIG-IP.In July 2020, a critical RCE bug left thousands of F5 BIG-IP users\u2019 accounts vulnerable to an attacker.\u00a0Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "A threat group responsible for sophisticated cyberespionage attacks against U.S. utilities is actually comprised of three subgroups, all with their own toolsets and targets, that have been operating globally since 2018, researchers have found.TA410 is a cyberespionage umbrella group loosely linked to APT10, a group tied to China\u2019s Ministry of State Security. The group is known not only for targeting U.S. organizations in the utilities sector, but also diplomatic organizations in the Middle East and Africa, according to a report published this week by researchers at security firm ESET.Though it\u2019s apparently been active since 2018, TA410 first came up on researchers\u2019 radar in 2019, when Proofpoint uncovered a phishing campaign targeting three U.S. companies in the utilities sector that used a novel malware then dubbed LookBack.About a year later, the threat group resurfaced by deploying a sophisticated RAT against Windows targets in the United States\u2019 utilities sector. Dubbed FlowCloud and believed to be the evolution of Lookback, the RAT can access installed applications and control the keyboard, mouse, screen, files, services and processes of an infected computer. The tool also can exfiltrate information to a command-and-control (C2) provider.Now ESET researchers have found that TA410 is not one but actually three subgroups of threat actors\u2014FlowingFrog, LookingFrog and JollyFrog\u2014each \u201cusing very similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) but different toolsets and exiting from IP addresses located in three different districts,\u201d researchers Alexandre C\u00f4t\u00e9 Cyr and Matthieu Faou wrote in the report.The teams have overlaps in TTPs, victimology and network infrastructure, and they compromise global targets\u2014primarily government or education organizations\u2013in various ways, indicating that victims are targeted specifically, \u201cwith the attackers choosing which entry method has the best chance of infiltrating the target,\u201d researchers said.Those ways include a new version of FlowCloud as well as access to the most recently known Microsoft Exchange remote code execution vulnerabilities, ProxyLogon and ProxyShell, among other tools\u2014both custom and generic\u2014that are specific to each group, researchers found.FlowingFrogResearchers analyzed the activity of each subgroup, including which tools they use and what type of victims they target. They also identified overlap in which the actors work together.Flowing Frog shares network infrastructure\u2014specifically, the domain ffca.caibi379[.]com\u2014with JollyFrog. It also ran the phishing campaign uncovered by Proofpoint in 2019 together with LookingFrog, researchers said.The subgroup has its own specific mode of attack and has launched campaigns against specific targets\u2013namely universities, the foreign diplomatic mission of a South Asian country in China and a mining company in India, researchers found.FlowingFrog uses a first stage that ESET researchers have named the Tendyron downloader, and then FlowCloud as a second stage they said.\u201cTendyron.exe is a legitimate executable, signed by online-banking security vendor Tendyron Corporation, and that is vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking,\u201d researchers explained.FlowingFrog also uses Royal Road, a malicious document builder used by several cyberespionage groups that builds RTF documents exploiting Equation Editor N-day vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882, researchers said.LookingFrogLookingFrog typically targets diplomatic missions, charity organizations and entities in government and industrial manufacturing using two main malware families: X4 and LookBack.X4 is a custom backdoor that is used as a first stage before LookBack is deployed researchers explained. The backdoor is loaded by a VMProtect-ed loader, usually named PortableDeviceApi.dll or WptsExtensions.dll.LookBack is a RAT written in C++ that relies on a proxy communication tool to relay data from the infected host to the command-and-control server (C2). The malware has capabilities to view process, system and file data; delete files; take screenshots; move and click the infected system\u2019s mouse; reboot machines; and delete itself from an infected host.LookBack is comprised of several components, including a C2 proxy tool, a malware loader, a communications module to create the C2 channel with the GUP proxy tool, and a RAT component to decode the initial beacon response received from the GUP proxy tool.JollyFrogThe third and final team of TA410, JollyFrog, targets organizations in education, religion, and the military as well as those with diplomatic missions, researchers found. Rather than use custom tools, the group exclusively uses generic, off-the-shelf malware from known families QuasarRAT and Korplug, aka PlugX.Quasar RAT is a full-featured backdoor freely available on GitHub and is a popular tool used by cyberespionage and cybercrime threat actors, researchers said. It\u2019s been previously used in a phishing campaign targeting companies with fake job-seeker Microsoft Word resumes and a 2019 APT10 malicious cyber campaign against government and private organizations in Southeast Asia.Korplug is a backdoor that that also has been used for years by various cyberespionage groups and remains a popular tool. Last month, China\u2019s Mustang Panda/TA416/RedDelta used Korplug in an espionage campaign against diplomatic missions, research entities and internet service providers (ISPs) in and around Southeast Asia.TA410 typically deploys Korplug as a RARSFX archive, generally named m.exe and containing three files: qrt.dll, acustom loader; qrtfix.exe, a legitimate signed application from F-Secure, vulnerable to DLL search-order hijacking; and qrt.dll.usb: the Korplug shellcode.\u201cThe loader allocates memory using VirtualAlloc and copies the content of qrt.dll.usb there,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThen it jumps right into the shellcode that will decompress and load the Korplug payload.\u201dUpdated Version of FlowCloudESET researchers also took a look under the hood of an updated version of FlowCloud currently being used by TA410.FlowCloud is a complex implant written in C++ comprised of three main components\u2014a rootkit functionality, a simple persistence module and a custom backdoor\u2013deployed in a multistage process that uses various obfuscation and encryption techniques to hinder analysis.While Proofpoint researchers previously analyzed FlowCloud versions 4.1.3 and 5.0.1, TA410 is now using FlowCloud versions 5.0.2 and 5.0.3, which have new capabilities, they said.\u201cContrary to those previously found, the samples we obtained for version 5.0.2 contain verbose error messages and meticulous logging,\u201d researchers explained.The new version of the tool now also can perform the following activities:Controlling connected microphones and triggering recording when sound levels above a specified threshold volume are detected;Monitoring clipboard events to steal clipboard content;Monitoring file system events to collect new and modified files; andControlling attached camera devices to take pictures of the compromised computer\u2019s surroundings.GovernmentHacks",

        "raw text": "The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicted four Russian government employees in connection to plots to cyber-fry critical infrastructure in the United States and beyond, including at least one nuclear power plant.The campaigns involved one of the most dangerous malwares ever encountered in the operational technology and energy sectors: Triton, aka Trisis, a Russia-linked malware used to shut down an oil refinery in 2017 and another Mideast target in 2019.Two related indictments were unsealed yesterday: one that named Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh (PDF), an employee of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and another (PDF) that named three officers in Military Unit 71330 \u2013 or \u201cCenter 16\u201d \u2013 of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB), which is the successor to Russia\u2019s KGB.Center 16 is the FSB\u2019s main structural unit for signals intelligence, consisting of a central unit housed in unmarked administrative buildings spread across Moscow and secluded forest enclosures, with massive satellite dishes pointing out to listen to the world. It\u2019s known by cybersecurity researchers as \u201cDragonfly,\u201d \u201cEnergetic Bear\u201d and \u201cCrouching Yeti.\u201d$10M Reward for Intel on FSB OfficersThere\u2019s a reward on the heads of the trio of FSB officers for allegedly hacking a refinery. The State Department said on Thursday that its Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is offering $10 million for information on the three, whose names are Pavel Aleksandrovich Akulov, Mikhail Mikhailovich Gavrilov and Marat Valeryevich Tyukov.The officers were allegedly involved in computer intrusions, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and damage to an energy facility. The reward marks the first time that RFJ has named a foreign government security personnel under its critical infrastructure reward offer, the State Department said.Triton/TrisisTriton was allegedly used in campaigns run between May and September 2017.Researchers have compared Triton\u2019s targeting of industrial control systems (ICS) to malware used in the watershed attacks Stuxnet and Industroyer/Crashoverride, the latter of which is a backdoor that targets ICS and which took down the Ukrainian power grid in Kiev in 2016. In 2018, research revealed that Industroyer was linked to the massive NotPetya ransomware outbreak that crippled organizations around the world the year before.According to the indictment, between May and September 2017, Gladkikh, a 36-year-old computer programmer employed by an institute affiliated with the Russian Ministry of Defense, was involved in a campaign to hack global energy facilities \u201cusing techniques designed to enable future physical damage with potentially catastrophic effects.\u201d The hacking allegedly led to two separate emergency shutdowns at a foreign facility.Along with co-conspirators, Gladkikh allegedly hacked the systems of \u201ca foreign refinery\u201d (presumably Saudi oil giant Petro Rabigh) in 2017 and installed Triton/Trisis malware on a safety system produced by Schneider Electric. Triton actually takes its name from the fact that it\u2019s designed to target Triconex safety instrumented system (SIS) controllers, which are sold by Schneider Electric. Triton surfaced again in 2019, when it was again used to target an undisclosed company in the Middle East.Triton was designed to prevent the refinery\u2019s safety systems from functioning \u2013 \u201cby causing the ICS to operate in an unsafe manner while appearing to be operating normally,\u201d the DOJ said \u2013 thereby leaving the refinery open to damage and jeopardizing anybody nearby.\u201cWhen the defendant deployed the Triton malware, it caused a fault that led the refinery\u2019s Schneider Electric safety systems to initiate two automatic emergency shutdowns of the refinery\u2019s operations,\u201d the DOJ said. Between February and July 2018, Gladkikh and his crew allegedly researched and (unsuccessfully) tried to hack the computer systems used by a U.S. company with similar refineries.As energy news outlet E&E News reported in 2019, in the early evening of Aug. 4, 2017, two emergency shutdown systems sprang to life at Petro Rabigh\u2019s sprawling refinery along Saudi Arbia\u2019s Red Sea coast. Engineers working the weekend shift were oblivious, even as the systems knocked the complex offline \u201cin a last-gasp effort to prevent a gas release and deadly explosion.\u201d\u201c[They] spotted nothing out of the ordinary, either on their computer screens or out on the plant floor,\u201d according to E&E News.Gladkikh has been charged with three counts: conspiracy to cause damage to an energy facility, attempt to damage an energy facility, and one count of conspiracy to commit computer fraud.FSB Officers\u2019 Indictment: The Dragonfly Supply-Chain AttackThe indictment that names the FSB officers alleges that, between 2012 and 2017, Akulov, Gavrilov, Tyukov and their co-conspirators engaged in computer intrusions, including supply chain attacks, \u201cin furtherance of the Russian government\u2019s efforts to maintain surreptitious, unauthorized and persistent access to the computer networks of companies and organizations in the international energy sector, including oil and gas firms, nuclear power plants, and utility and power transmission companies.\u201dSpecifically, they allegedly targeted the software and hardware that controls equipment in power generation facilities, known as ICS or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems.\u201cAccess to such systems would have provided the Russian government the ability to, among other things, disrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s press release.The indictment describes a campaign against the energy sector that involved two phases: The first was a supply-chain attack that was commonly referred to as \u201cDragonfly\u201d or \u201cHavex\u201d by security researchers. Dragonfly took place between 2012 and 2014 and compromised computer networks of ICS/SCADA system manufacturers and software vendors.It involved tucking the Havex remote-access trojan (RAT) inside legitimate software updates. According to a 2014 advisory from the Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT), the Havex RAT targeted vendors via phishing campaigns, website redirects and, finally, by infecting the software installers. Three vendor websites were compromised in watering-hole attacks, the ICS-CERT advisory said.\u201cAfter unsuspecting customers downloaded Havex-infected updates, the conspirators would use the malware to, among other things, create backdoors into infected systems and scan victims\u2019 networks for additional ICS/SCADA devices,\u201d according to the DOJ. The gang allegedly managed to install malware on more than 17,000 unique devices in the United States and abroad, including ICS/SCADA controllers used by power and energy companies.Dragonfly 2.0: Spearphishing a Nuclear Power PlantBetween 2014 and 2017, the campaign entered into what\u2019s commonly referred to as \u201cDragonfly 2.0,\u201d wherein the suspects allegedly turned their focus to specific energy sector entities and individuals and engineers who worked with ICS/SCADA systems.This second phase entailed spearphishing attacks targeting more than 3,300 users at more than 500 U.S. and international companies and entities, in addition to U.S. government agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.The spearphishing attacks sometimes struck gold, including in the compromise of the business network (i.e., involving computers not directly connected to ICS/SCADA equipment) of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation (Wolf Creek) in Burlington, Kansas. Wolf Creek operates a nuclear power plant.\u201cMoreover, after establishing an illegal foothold in a particular network, the conspirators typically used that foothold to penetrate further into the network by obtaining access to other computers and networks at the victim entity,\u201d according to the DOJ.Dragonfly 2.0 also entailed a watering-hole attack wherein the alleged attackers exploited publicly known vulnerabilities in content management software (CMS) to compromise servers that hosted websites commonly visited by ICS/SCADA system and other energy sector engineers. \u201cWhen the engineers browsed to a compromised website, the conspirators\u2019 hidden scripts deployed malware designed to capture login credentials onto their computers,\u201d the DOJ said.The campaign targeted victims in the United States and in more than 135 other countries, the Feds said.The FSB officers are looking at charges of conspiracy to cause damage to the property of an energy facility and commit computer fraud and abuse and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Akulov and Gavrilov are also charged with substantive counts of wire fraud and computer fraud related to unlawfully obtaining information from computers and causing damage to computers. Akulov and Gavrilov are also charged with three counts of aggravated identity theft.Still Gaping Security Holes in Energy CompaniesLookingGlass CEO Gilman Louie, an expert on national security and cybersecurity who regularly shares or analyzes intel with government agencies, told Threatpost on Friday that legal actions against the potential operators of the critically dangerous Triton malware are welcome: They\u2019re a \u201cpositive move [that] sends a strong message to cybercrime and nation-state actors globally,\u201d he said via email.On the less-positive side, a recent LookingGlass cyber profile of the U.S. Energy sector looks grim.Many energy companies are sitting ducks, with current cybersecurity exposures that have already been exploited by Russian actors in the past, including open ports that enable threat actors to gain full remote access.The report shares vulnerabilities and exposures that Russian hackers are known to have used. \u201cFor years, energy companies have been hammered on securing their operational technology. The Triton attacks show why this is important,\u201d Louie noted.But he stated that \u201corganizations also need to ensure they\u2019re improving security on their traditional IT side.\u201d He pointed to the Colonial Pipeline attack as an example of how adversaries \u201cdidn\u2019t need in-depth knowledge of [operational technology, or OT] to shut down the flow of gas or oil.\u201d\u00a0LookingGlass research shows that, across the energy sector, there are vulnerabilities that are more than 5 years old that haven\u2019t been dealt with, and open ports like remote desktop that are \u201cbasically unprotected doors into an organization.\u201dEnergy companies need to be patching or updating their systems, Louie said and shutting those open doors: \u201cIf they really need a port open for remote desktop, then they need to add layers of compensating security controls to make sure it\u2019s not easy to exploit.\u201dWhen unsealing the indictments, the government noted that it\u2019s taking action to\u00a0enhance private sector network defense efforts\u00a0and to\u00a0disrupt similar malicious activity.Other security issues that Russian actors have leveraged, which companies need to address immediately before they are used for attacks that could be bigger than those we\u2019ve already seen, include:Default Passwords: Exactly what it sounds like. Default passwords are a major attack vector. Not changing default passwords, especially with a tool like Telnet, leaves companies wide open to Russian access to networks.Port 161 \u2013 SNMP protocol: The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses both port 161 and port 162 for sending commands and messages and is being used by Russia to gain access to network devices and infrastructure. Older versions of this protocol are unsecure and allow threat actors to eavesdrop or manipulate data.Port 139/445 \u2013 SMB:\u00a0The SMB network port is commonly used for file sharing. Russian groups have successfully targeted this port to execute remote code and to steal information, LookingGlass found.These are just a few examples of security exposures that threat actors tied directly to Russia have exploited and will likely exploit again within U.S. companies, according to LookingGlass\u2019s research.It\u2019s not time to wait for a nuclear-level cyber event, given that threat actors are already inside the power infrastructure. Now\u2019s the time for companies to find and mitigate the holes that let them in, Louie said.\u201cEnergy sector entities should be reviewing their digital footprint and taking action to secure their external-facing assets, especially as the threat of Russian cyberattacks intensifies,\u201d he said.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Carnival Corp., the world\u2019s largest cruise-ship operator, has sprung another leak: For the second time in a year, attackers have breached email accounts and accessed personal, financial and health information belonging to guests, employees and crew.Carnival has quite the armada: Its cruise brands include Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland America Line, Seabourn, P&O Cruises (Australia), Costa Cruises, AIDA Cruises, P&O Cruises (UK) and Cunard. It also operates Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, a tour company that sails around Alaska and the Canadian Yukon.In a data breach notification letter sent to affected customers and first spotted by BleepingComputer, Carnival said that \u201cunauthorized third-party access to a limited number of email accounts\u201d was detected in mid-March.But Carnival\u2019s SVP and chief communications officer Roger Frizzell later told the news outlet that the attackers also gained access to \u201climited portions of its information technology systems.\u201d\u201cIt appears that in mid-March, the unauthorized third-party gained access to certain personal information relating to some of our guests, employees and crew,\u201d Frizzell reportedly said. \u201cThe impacted information includes data routinely collected during the guest experience and travel-booking process, or through the course of employment or providing services to the company, including COVID or other safety testing.\u201dIn its data breach notification, sent on Thursday, the company added that there is evidence indicating \u201ca low likelihood of the data being misused.\u201dAccording to the letter, the improperly accessed information included names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, dates of birth, health information, and, in some limited instances, additional personal information such as Social-Security or national-identification numbers.Fourth Leak in Carnival\u2019s Hull Over 15 MonthsThis is the fourth time in a bit over a year that Carnival\u2019s admitted to breaches, with two of them being ransomware attacks.Fifteen months ago, in March 2020, Carnival Cruise Lines disclosed that it was hit with a data breach: Threat actors accessed names, addresses, Social Security numbers, passport numbers or driver\u2019s-license numbers, credit-card and financial account information, and health-related information.Seven months later, last October, Carnival disclosed that it had suffered a ransomware attack on the previous Aug. 15 that affected three cruise lines: Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line and Seabourn. At the time, Carnival said that there was a \u201clow likelihood of the data being misused,\u201d just as it said about the most recent May attack.Carnival had already revealed that it was the target of a ransomware attack on Aug. 17, two days after the attack. At the time, the company acknowledged that hackers had accessed and encrypted a portion of one brand\u2019s IT systems and had downloaded data files, getting access to customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 information.BleepingComputer\u2019s Sergiu Gatlan came across a fourth, previously undisclosed ransomware attack, detected in December, that Carnival detailed in a 10-Q form filed with the SEC this past April. The form reportedly noted that the \u201cinvestigation and remediation phases\u201d of that ransomware attack was still ongoing at the time.Protecting Data from Becoming Flotsam & JetsamAfter this most recent attack, security experts pondered what, exactly, is up with Carnival\u2019s defenses.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that there have been additional attacks against Carnival,\u201d observed Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy. He suggested to Threatpost in an email on Friday that the cruise line\u2019s history shows that it\u2019s failed to take steps to protect itself from attacks like these.That\u2019s too bad, given what an attractive target the travel industry is for threat actors, Hauk continued. \u201cWith the expected increase in vacation and business travel this coming year, all things travel will begin to look like appetizing targets for the bad actors of the world,\u201d he said. His advice to help prevent unauthorized third-party access to data starts with \u201cupdating all systems to ensure that the latest security patches have been applied,\u201d he advised, and to educate employees and executives as to the risk of opening links or attachments found in emails and text messages.Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, noted that these attacks come just as people start to book trips after the long COVID-19 travel shutdown. That comes as no surprise, given the high value of the data that travel companies collect, he noted in an email to Threatpost on Friday.\u201cThe type of data and the sheer volume of it being collected by Carnival can be very valuable to attackers, so it is no big surprise they have been a target,\u201d he said. \u201cMost large cruises, by their very nature, tend to visit ports in foreign countries, so they must collect sensitive information to be used for customs preparation and other purposes related to the travel. This includes Social-Security numbers, passport numbers, full names, addresses, phone numbers and much more \u2013 all data that could be easily used to steal identities or open accounts in potential victims\u2019 names.\u201dKron explained that these types of attacks are often started through email phishing attacks, making it wise for organizations to invest in high-quality email filtering and an employee training program focused on spotting email phishing attacks and on using proper password hygiene. He also suggested investing in data-loss prevention (DLP) solutions and enabling multi-factor authentication on accounts.No Stock Price Pain, No Security Gain?Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech, echoed Hauk in saying that he\u2019d be \u201cextremely hesitant\u201d to trust the company with his personal information. \u201cAs these attacks become a pattern instead of isolated incidents, I have to wonder whether Carnival is really prioritizing cybersecurity or if it\u2019s just an afterthought,\u201d he told Threatpost via email on Friday.Bischoff noted that Carnival\u2019s stock price hasn\u2019t significantly suffered from any of its recent data incidents. It was down 2 percent Thursday evening following its breach disclosure, and it was down about 1 percent on Friday morning. At this rate, the company doesn\u2019t have much incentive to fix whatever\u2019s causing these breaches, he said: \u201cIf shareholders continue to profit from the status quo, it\u2019s unlikely the company will invest in better cybersecurity technology and talent.\u201dJohn Bambenek, threat intelligence advisor at Netenrich, said that at this point, it looks like Carnival\u2019s just asking for it: \u201cThe fact that Carnival has been hit three times in under 12 months means some serious questions need to be asked on what this company is doing to protect its sensitive information,\u201d he opined in an email to Threatpost on Friday. \u201cAt a certain point, they are advertising to the world that they are an easy target, and can look forward to more frequent and serious attacks.\u201d061821 12:38 UPDATE: Carnival\u2019s SVP and chief communications officer Roger Frizzell confirmed the March 19 discovery of the breach to Threatpost on Friday. He said via email that \u201cseveral months ago (on March 19), Carnival Corporation detected unauthorized third-party access to limited portions of its information technology systems. Information Security at Carnival Corporation acted quickly to shut down the event and prevent further unauthorized access.\u201cA cybersecurity firm was engaged to investigate the matter, and regulators were notified. The investigation revealed unauthorized third-party access to certain personal information relating to some guests, employees and crew for Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and medical operations. There is evidence indicating a low likelihood of the data being misused.\u201cThe company has notified guests, employees, crew and other individuals whose personal information may have been impacted. It also has established a dedicated call center to answer questions regarding the event. As part of its ongoing operations, the company is continuing to review security and privacy policies and procedures and has been implementing changes as needed to enhance our information security and privacy program and controls.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "Use a burner phone if you\u2019re traveling to the Olympics, the FBI warned on Tuesday, lest you come home with a nasty case of malware and/or snatched personal data.The FBI didn\u2019t mention specific threats, per se, but its alert warned those traveling to the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and March 2022 Paralympics that we\u2019ve seen this all before with the Olympics, where \u201cmalicious cyber actors could use a broad range of cyber activities to disrupt these events.\u201dIt\u2019s not just athletes and other attendees\u2019 personal phones that are going to be targeted by testosterone-pumped cyber actors or zealous state actors swarming the event, the bureau said, just as malicious actors zeroed in on the Tokyo Summer Olympics, looking to disrupt the Games\u2019 TV broadcasts. The same day the FBI released a warning about that earlier threat, in July 2021, the personal data of volunteers and ticket purchasers for the Tokyo Olympics was leaked online.In Tuesday\u2019s alert (PDF), the FBI noted that NTT Corporation \u2013 which provided services for the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games \u2013 revealed (PDF) that there were more than 450 million attempted cyber-related incidents during the event, \u201cthough none were successful due to cybersecurity measures in place.\u201d\u201cWhile there were no major cyber disruptions, the most popular attack methods used were malware, email spoofing, phishing and the use of fake websites and streaming services designed to look like official Olympic service providers,\u201d the FBI said.The FBI also noted that during the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, cyber actors associated with Russia conducted, including the Olympic Destroyer attack that crushed the Games\u2019 Opening Ceremony \u2013 attacks enabled through spear-phishing campaigns and malicious mobile aps.Burner Phones to the RescueExpect a copy-C, copy-V situation this time around, the Feds warned. The FBI noted that the upcoming Olympic games in Beijing (which run Feb. 4 \u2013 20) and the Winter Paralympics (March 4 \u2013 13) will see a heightened risk of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks designed to disrupt events \u2013 the number of which had shattered records as of November 2021 \u2013 as well as ransomware, other malware, social engineering, data theft or leaks, phishing campaigns, disinformation campaigns, and insider threats.With regards to packing a burner phone and leaving your personal phone at home, the FBI warned of potential threats associated with mobile apps developed by untrusted vendors. \u201cThe FBI urges all athletes to keep their personal cell phone at home and use a temporary phone while attending the events,\u201d CISA (the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) said.\u201cThe download and use of applications, including those required to participate or stay in country, could increase the opportunity for cyber actors to steal personal information or installtracking tools, malicious code, or malware,\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s Privacy Industry Notification (PIN) (PDF).\u2018Official\u2019 Apps Can Be Just as BadSecurity experts pointed out that it\u2019s not just mobile apps coming from untrusted vendors that are sketchy. We\u2019ve seen mobile apps packed with malware, delivering spy trojans via Google\u2019s Play store; Joker malware repeatedly fleecing people with premium SMS charges, also on Google Play; and malicious apps that have infested Apple\u2019s Play Store.\u201cThis is a flaw in the model for publishing apps,\u201d Mark Lambert, vice president of products at application security provider ArmorCode, told Threatpost via email on Tuesday. \u201cConsumers expect that they are protected with \u2018official apps,\u2019 but the app store providers are not able to keep up with the volume and pace of apps being published to their marketplaces.\u201dThe bureau noted that other Western countries have also warned their athletes to leave their personal devices at home or use temporary phones to reduce their cybersecurity risk. \u201cThe FBI to date is not aware of any specific cyber threat against the Olympics, but encourages partners to remain vigilant and maintain best practices in their network and digital environments,\u201d according to the FBI\u2019s PIN, which also lists network and remote-work best practices.\u201cLarge, high-profile events provide an opportunity for criminal and nation-state cyber actors to make money, sow confusion, increase their notoriety, discredit adversaries, and advance ideological goals,\u201d the FBI said.The Feds gave a long laundry list of the factors that are going to spike the cybersecurity dangers: \u201cDue to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, no foreign spectators will be allowed to attend the Olympics or Paralympics. Spectators will be reliant on remote streaming services and social media throughout the duration of the Games,\u201d according to the alert.\u201cAdversaries could use social engineering and phishing campaigns leading up to and during the event to implant malware to disrupt networks broadcasting the event. Cyber actors could use ransomware or other malicious tools and services available for purchase to execute DDoS attacks against Internet service providers and television broadcast companies to interrupt service during the Olympics. Similarly, actors could target the networks of hotels, mass transit providers, ticketing services, event security infrastructure or similar Olympic support functions.\u201dFBI Warning Follows One From Citizen LabThe FBI alert follows a similar cybersecurity warning from the Citizen Lab cybersecurity group, which last month warned that MY2022 \u2013 an app mandated for use by all attendees of the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games \u2013 has a \u201csimple but devastating\u201d flaw wherein encryption protecting users\u2019 voice audio and file transfers \u201ccan be trivially sidestepped.\u201dThe flaw endangers users\u2019 health customs forms, which transmit passport details, their demographic information, and their medical and travel history, the group reported.\u201cServer responses can also be spoofed,\u201d Citizen Lab said, \u201callowing an attacker to display fake instructions to users.\u201dCitizen Lab also said that MY2022 is subject to censorship based on a list of keywords, and that its privacy policy isn\u2019t clear about who received and processed the data uploaded to the app.Lookout researchers took a look at the app and found that the app also has a chat feature, as well as file transfer capabilities between users. \u201cConsidering the likelihood that the Chinese government could be monitoring all of this data, users should not use the app for anything more than the bare minimum,\u201d warned Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at endpoint-to-cloud security company Lookout. \u201cBy the same token, they should enter as little information as they\u2019re required to.\u201dLeave Other Blabby Gadgets Home, TooIt\u2019s not just your phone, security experts emphasized: It\u2019s every other blabby gadget that beams out data via cellular, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity: They\u2019re all open to being compromised. \u201cYou should always turn off these capabilities when not in use, disable \u2018discovery features\u2019 and never connect to a source that you are unfamiliar with,\u201d Mark Lambert, vice president of products at application security provider ArmorCode, told Threatpost via email on Tuesday.\u201cOn a side note, be especially wary of internet connections broadcasting \u2018Public Free Internet\u2019 when you cannot verify physically that you are connecting to a trustworthy SSID \u2013 e.g. a posted sign.\u201dHow to Stay Safe(r)Lookout\u2019s Schless told Threatpost on Tuesday via email that whether athletes and other attendees are using burner phones or not, \u201cthey should be incredibly wary of any individual, app, or message that encourages them to share login credentials.\u201dThe risk of being phished on mobile is real, \u201cregardless of the type of device or operating system, he noted. \u201cApps could easily be running malware in the background, especially if they aren\u2019t being downloaded from a trusted source like the App Store or Play Store.\u201dBe it a burner or not, keep your devices with you at all times or locked up in a safe place, he recommended.This isn\u2019t just good advice for traveling to China, of course. Border patrol agents can, and do, grab and search devices in countries such as the United States that don\u2019t have as bad a rap as China does when it comes to state surveillance and censorship.\u201cRegardless of the country, border patrol in certain places may ask you to turn over any devices you\u2019re bringing into the country,\u201d Schless noted. \u201cThis could be incredibly high risk, as the agents may be under orders to install spyware on the device of anyone coming into the country \u2013 especially if it is run by an authoritarian government.\u201dJohn Bambenek, principal threat hunter at digital IT and security operations company Netenrich, told Threatpost that besides being mindful of one\u2019s surroundings, it\u2019s wise to use a dedicated card for the trip and keep others at home. Also, keep internet usage on your own burner phone or devices.\u201cKeep in mind that China does censor internet content and trying to evade such censorship to go to banned sites may get you in additional trouble,\u201d he cautioned in an email on Tuesday. \u201cAs a general rule, I\u2019ve avoided having any sensitive conversations while in a country that might be an espionage risk and simply waited to have them while at home.\u201dFinally, keep an eye on end points for indicators of compromise, advised Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at Cerberus Sentinel. Also, enact general cybersecurity best practices such as multi-factor authentication and patching, he suggested.\u201cFor those people traveling to Olympic games, it\u2019s important to understand both the invasiveness and capabilities of border security agencies screening entry with regards to cyber security when traveling,\u201d he noted in an email to Threatpost on Tuesday.\u201cAs a rule, it\u2019s important to assume all bets are off as to the security of any device traveling with you, the privacy of the data within, or to any accounts linked to that device including social media.\u201dHe reiterated what others have said about this being good advice for \u201calmost any foreign country. Border control agencies often have broad authority to inspect or completely clone devices, compel the traveler to unlock, or even share passwords for online accounts. For this reason, it\u2019s often recommended that travelers concerned with this possibility carry disposable devices for use while traveling that can be disposed of before leaving.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentHacksMalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals are tapping into the impending rollout of COVID-19 vaccines with everything from simple phishing scams all the way up to sophisticated Zebrocy malware campaigns.Security researchers with KnowBe4 said that the recent slew of vaccine-related cyberattacks leverage the widespread media attention around the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines \u2013 as well as recent reports that manufacturers like Pfizer may not be able to supply additional doses of its vaccine to the U.S. large volumes until sometime in Q2.These lures continue to play into the high emotions of victims during a pandemic \u2013 something seen in various phishing and malware campaigns throughout the last year.Click to register.\u201cMalicious actors had a field day back in March in April as the Coronavirus washed over countries around the world,\u201d said Eric Howes, with KnowBe4, in a Wednesday post. \u201cIt was and still is the perfect tool for social engineering scared, confused, and even downright paranoid end users into opening the door to your organization\u2019s network.\u201dZebrocy Malware LuresResearchers with Intezer recently discovered a new Zebrocy malware sample in a campaign that has the hallmarks of a COVID-19 vaccine lure. In November, researchers uncovered a Virtual Hard Drive (VHD) file (VHD is the native file format for virtual hard drives used by Microsoft\u2019s hypervisor, Hyper-V).This VHD file included a file that suggests cybercriminals behind the attack using a COVID-19 vaccine-related spear-phishing lure. This PDF file consisted of presentation slideshows about Sinopharm International Corporation, which is a China-based pharmaceutical company currently working on a COVID-19 vaccine. Sinopharm International Corporation\u2019s vaccine is currently undergoing\u00a0phase three\u00a0clinical trials but it has already been\u00a0distributed\u00a0to nearly one million people.The second VHD file, masquerading as a Microsoft file, was a sample of Zebrocy written in Go. Zebrocy (also known as Sednit, APT28, Fancy Bear, and STRONTIUM), a malware used by the threat group Sofacy, operates as a downloaders and collects data about the infected host that is then uploaded to the command-and-control (C2) server before downloading and executing the next stage. Researchers noted that the C2 infrastructure linked to this campaign appears to be new.Researchers warn that the attackers behind Zebrocy will likely continue to utilize COVID-19 vaccines as a lure: \u201cGiven that many COVID-19 vaccines are about to be approved for clinical use, it\u2019s likely that APTs (Advanced Persistent Threat) and financially motivated threat actors will use this malware in their attacks,\u201d they said in a Wednesday post.\u2018Fill Out This Form\u2019 To Get Vaccine A recent phishing scam spotted by researchers lures victims into \u201cfill out a form\u201d to get their vaccine. In reality, they are targeting email credentials. Eric Howes, principal lab researcher at KnowBe4, told Threatpost that researchers \u201csaw a very small number of emails\u201d connected to the campaign, which all went to .EDU email addresses.\u201cI doubt this particular email was very targeted, so it\u2019s entirely possible \u2013 even likely \u2013 that plenty of other organizations received copies of that email,\u201d said Howes. \u201cJust how many, we do not know.\u201dThe emails say, \u201cdue to less stock covid-19 vaccine and high increase demand of the covid-19 vaccine distribution within the USA,\u201d they need to fill out a form in order to get on the vaccine distribution list.Phishing email sample. Credit: KnowBe4The email, titled \u201cFILL OUT THE FORM TO GET COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTE TO YOU,\u201d has plenty of red flags \u2013 including grammatical errors and a lack of branding that could make it appear legitimate.However, Howes said that \u201cdesperation, fear, curiosity and anxiety\u201d could cause recipients to ignore these red flags and move forward in clicking the link.\u201cGiven that we\u2019re now nine months into the pandemic in the United States, people are weary and looking for a way out,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cEven though this email was not as polished as it could have been, when recipients are highly motivated to learn more about the announced subject of an email, those kinds of obvious red flags can be ignored or not even noticed.\u201dShould a recipient click on the link provided to what\u2019s purported to be the \u201cPDF form,\u201d they are redirected to a phishing landing page that pretends to be a PDS online cloud document manager. The site (pdf-cloud.square[.]site), which is still active as of article publication, asks users for their email address and password in order to sign in.This attack piggybacks off recent related COVID-19 vaccine phishing emails from earlier this month, including on that tells recipients to click a link in order to reserve their dose of the COVID-19 vaccine through their \u201chealthcare portal.\u201dCOVID-19 CampaignsResearchers warn that cybercriminals will continue to leverage the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine in various novel ways.For instance, just this week Europol, the European Union\u2019s law-enforcement agency, issued a warning about the rise of vaccine-related Dark Web activity.Meanwhile, this month a sophisticated, global phishing campaign has been targeting the credentials of organizations associated with the COVID-19 \u201ccold-chain\u201d \u2013 companies that ensure the safe preservation of vaccines by making sure they are stored and transported in temperature-controlled environments.COVID vaccine manufacturer\u00a0Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories was forced to shut down factories in Brazil, India, the U.K. and U.S. in late October, which were contracted to make the Russian vaccine \u201cSputnik V.\u201d \u00a0And the\u00a0APT group DarkHotel targeted the World Health Organization\u00a0last March, in an attempt to steal any information they could find related to tests, vaccines or trial cures.\u201cWith these recent phishing lures, it\u2019s clear that COVID-19 themed attacks are still a threat and we might see more as vaccines become available to the general public,\u201d said Intezer researchers. \u201cIt\u2019s important that companies use defense-in-depth strategies to protect against threats. Employers should also ensure employees are trained on detecting and reacting to phishing attempts.\u201dPut Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows, and Israel Barak, CISO at Cybereason,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

        "raw text": "A long-term spear-phishing campaign is targeting employees of major corporations with emails containing PDFs that link to short-lived Glitch apps hosting credential-harvesting SharePoint phishing pages, researchers have found.Researchers from DomainTools discovered the suspicious PDFs \u2013 which themselves do not include malicious content \u2013 back in July, wrote Senior Security Researcher Chad Anderson, in a report published Thursday.Instead, the malicious activity propagated by the PDFs is a link to Glitch apps hosting phishing pages that included obfuscated JavaScript for stealing credentials, he wrote. Glitch is a Web-based project-management tool with a built-in code editor for running and hosting software projects ranging from simple websites to large applications.The campaign appears to be targeting only employees working in the Middle East as \u201ca single campaign\u201d in a series of similar, SharePoint-themed phishing scams, Anderson wrote.Abusing Glitch To understand how the campaign works, one needs to understand how the free version of Glitch works, Anderson explained. The platform allows an app to operate for five minutes exposed to the internet with a Glitch-provided hostname using three random words, he wrote.\u201cFor example, one document directed the recipient to hammerhead-resilient-birch.glitch[.]me where the malicious content was stored,\u201d Anderson explained in the post. \u201cOnce the five minutes is up, the account behind the page has to click to serve their page again.\u201dIt\u2019s this \u201cephemeral nature\u201d that makes Glitch shared spaces ideal for threat actors that wish to host malicious content, given that they are difficult to detect. This is especially true \u201cbecause Glitch\u2019s domains are trusted and often allowlisted on many networks already,\u201d Anderson explained.\u201cSpaces where code can run and be hosted for free are a gold mine for attackers, especially considering many of the base domains are implicitly trusted by the blocklists corporations ingest,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis delegation of trust allows for attackers to utilize a seemingly innocuous PDF with only a link to a trusted base domain to maneuver past defenses and lure in user trust.\u201dIn this campaign, attackers used this aspect alongside exfiltration of credentials to compromised WordPress sites to create an attack chain that can sneak past defensive tooling, Anderson wrote. DomainTools Research attempted to speak to Glitch about this potential for abuse of the platform, but as yet has been unsuccessful, he added.Discovering the CampaignDomainTools researchers discovered the threat activity during regular monitoring and hunting for malicious documents tied to previous campaigns, Anderson wrote. Specifically, the team came across a PDF document purporting to be an invoice that included a URI section that linked to an outside page \u2013 something that typically wouldn\u2019t sound an alarm, he wrote.However, in this case, an email address was appended to the URL as a fragment, which typically references an \u201cid\u201d element on an HTML page, but which also can be manipulated using CSS. Moreover, the email address belonged to a legitimate employee at a corporation based in the United Arab Emirates: something that smacked of spear-phishing to researchers, Anderson wrote.Researchers hunted for similar documents and found nearly 70 dating back to July 30, all using different URLs to target email addresses of actual individuals working at large corporations, he explained.\u201cThough each URL and email was one of a kind, the documents themselves did link to the same named page each time: red.htm,\u201d suggesting a common scam, Anderson wrote.Evading DetectionBecause of the short-lived nature of the pages being used to harvest credentials, researchers said they were challenged to find live pages serving up the ultimate payload of the campaign. They had to use the tool URLScan, which allowed them to search through all of the scanned sites over the last month.Eventually, researchers uncovered a live site using the AnyRun service, a commercial malware sandbox and public repository of executed malware that can be used to find specific interactions from malicious code, Anderson explained. While the team still didn\u2019t find the next-stage payload, it did uncover a screenshot of the Microsoft SharePoint phishing login being used to lure the victim, he wrote.\u201cWhile the page content was not available, DomainTools Research did take note of the document name as well as the redirect to \u2018in.htm\u2019 as the next page after the \u2018red.htm\u2019 page in the initial PDF document,\u201d Anderson explained.Researchers found a number of matching HTML documents that tied to previous PDFs on VirusTotal \u2013 the initial PDF documents designed to pass the email of the target along as a URL fragment \u2013 by using email addresses pre-populated on the page, he wrote.The team also found \u201cchunks\u201d of obfuscated JavaScript that, once revealed, showed the email address and password being submitted to compromised WordPress sites and forwarded to an email address found in the body of the script of uzohifeanyi@outlook[.]com. Once attackers have harvested credentials, the JavaScript then redirects the user to the URL of their email address, Anderson wrote.Cybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

But we\u2019re getting some strange weather here in the northeast, very warm for fall.LC: yeah, it\u2019s been it\u2019s been wacky.LO: Definitely. Well, so Larry, just to start, can you tell us a little bit about yourself and how you first got into the security space?LC: So I was studying computer science at the University of Southern Maine back in the 1993 timeframe. And I had a friend who was in the Linux users group back then with me, and he told me that this company was hiring, what they called at the time \u201cinternet analysts\u201d to work on security stuff. And I\u2019m like, okay, I like to, you know, I could work there part time, make some money. And the company I joined was a small consulting company in Portland, Maine. And this company did security for a couple of a couple of companies in Southern Maine, but also a large bank that was out of Manhattan. And what we did was we did, we built firewalls or what we called Bastion hosts back then. So we would handle these firewalls. And we would put in rules to allow you know, certain services like pop mail and send mail and web browser, things like that, to occur while keeping the company secure. And build these these systems to keep these companies connected to the internet, but also keeping them secure. And that\u2019s where I first really sink my teeth into the security industry.LO:\u00a0Was that where you were a consultant for the first time when you discovered your first CVE back then?LC: No, actually, I had left that company to join Computer Science Corporation. Computer Science Corporation is a consulting firm that is subcontracted by large corporations to handle their IT infrastructure. And the company was subcontracted by Bath Iron Works, which is a shipbuilding company up in Bath, Maine. They build Aegis destroyers. It\u2019s a pretty large facility. And when I had, when I was hired on there, the group that I worked for, was in charge of 3,000 Unix systems. And these Unix systems varied from SGI IRIX, to Solaris to AIX to HPUX. So I had this enormous playground of servers and various Unix flavors that I could play with. So that\u2019s where I really started honing my skills on security vulnerabilities.Actually, there\u2019s a funny story where the first day that on my on the job, my new manager took me to the IRIX or the SGI computer room. And what what this room was a locked room that had a bunch of SGI Indigo boxes. So imagine these purple SGI boxes with the 3d creator cards in them and and they had, this this room was used for CAD drawings that they were developing at the time, for a new submarine system. And my manager sat down at one of the consoles. And he said, you know, he\u2019s like, \u201cin a couple of years, he\u2019s like, once you\u2019ve proved yourself, I\u2019ll give you a login on the systems.\u201d And me, you know, coming from a security company, I knew that SGI IRIX, by default, had no password on the LP user account. So you could literally walk up to any IRIX system that hadn\u2019t been secured, type in LP, hit Enter, and it would log you into the desktop windowing system. So I scrolled up to one of the one of the SGI systems, typed in LP, hit enter and said, \u201cthanks, I don\u2019t need to log on. I already got one.\u201d My manager one swung around on his chair and he goes, \u201chow did you do that?\u201d And I said, \u201cI know IRIX systems have an LP account that has no password by default on all the systems.\u201d And he looked at me and he says, \u201cWould you be willing to do security for us?\u201d And I said, \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d So from then on, I was the unofficial penetration tester for this network that was literally untouched by any security person, I think ever. There were so many systems that were, you know, misconfigured or or configured insecurely or just wide open. And I really honed my skills on this network of just breaking into all sorts of systems that I would have never had the opportunity to break into if I had been on smaller network. And that\u2019s where I discovered my first vulnerability.So another story is that we had this SGI Onyx/2, and for folks who don\u2019t know, an SGI Onyx/2 back then was like this $250,000 to half million dollar, depending on how you configured it, computer system that was about the size of a refrigerator. This system was used for 3D modeling, rendering, you know, 3D images and and you know, it was sort of like the \u201ccreme de la creme\u201d of computer graphics back then, right. And this, this SGI sat in its own private\u00a0data center that was locked, you had to enter a PIN code to get into the data center, there was only a select few Unix administrators who had it. I didn\u2019t have it, you know, my team didn\u2019t have it was only the guys who were like Unix admin level three, and I was just a level one. And these guys in this other team would always taunt us about, \u201coh, maybe someday you\u2019ll get access to the SGI onyx to and, and, you know, someday, you know, we\u2019ll maybe we\u2019ll give you a login and the key code again, or the door.\u201d And it always, you know, sort of aggravated me, I\u2019m like, I know that I can log into that system with an LP account, you know, I really want to get root on that system to show that it\u2019s owned, or once you have administrative access to a system in hacker speaking, \u201cowned the system.\u201d That\u2019s what I wanted to do to this thing. So I thought to myself, well, how can I get root on this system, I need another system that\u2019s just like it that I can examine the operating system and look for vulnerabilities on it. And I realized I access to an IRIX system. You know, in my office, I had, I had one that was nearby that I could tinker with. So I logged into it. And I\u2019m like if I\u2019m looking to elevate my privileges from LP, I should look at Setuid root binaries. And for folks who don\u2019t know a Setuid root binary is a binary that has a bit on it that set to execute as route one, a normal user runs it. So it executes with root privileges. Now this is back then this is, you know, this is pretty sketchy stuff to have a binary just running around with root privileges. This was the first thing that you would look at to abuse on a system that you were trying to hack. This was the this was the starting point, you know, for looking at ways to get higher access as an administrator.LO:\u00a0Right. Wasn\u2019t abusing Setuid binaries, that was a pretty big security trend at the time, too.LC: Yes. Yeah. Yes, yeah. And so I started looking in /usr/sbin/, which a lot of these binaries were living on. And I noticed this binary called Midikeys. And I\u2019m like, what, what is Midikeys? I\u2019ve never, you know, what can this thing be? So I ran it. And on my on my Windows system, this little keyboard popped up. It was like a little piano keyboard. And if you click the keys, it played a little tune, you know, each key was a different note. So I\u2019m like, Oh, this is kind of neat. I don\u2019t see who would spend their time making little songs on this. But but it\u2019s a neat little, little thing, right? And I\u2019m like, you know, if this thing\u2019sAn SGI Onyx/2 Credit: JC Penalvarunning his route, what what can it do? You know, as root, it can, it looks like it can read and write files. So can I write to files owned by root? So I opened up etc/passwd, add an account for myself and saved it. And sure enough, it was able to write to etc/passwd. So I thought to myself, well, here\u2019s a way I can get root on the Onyx/2. So I\u2019m like, okay, so I log into the Onyx/2, I forward an X Window back to my desktop, and I launched midikeys, and sure enough midikeys is on there. It\u2019s set UID root, and I edit MC password, and I add an entry Larry. And then I enter my, my user ID is zero and my group ID is zero. And I hit blank password, and then I save it. And I\u2019m like, cool. I, I log back in as Larry. I\u2019m in, I have a root prompt. I\u2019m like, cool. I\u2019ve got root on the Onix/2. So then I\u2019m like, Well, I should change the, you know, I should set a password on my account, so that it\u2019s not a password-less account. So I go to change the password. I type the password command and I suddenly realize my account user ID is zero. I\u2019m changing the root password for the root account, not for account Larry. So I\u2019m like shoot, I got to back out. So I hit Ctrl D, Ctrl. D, what happens is the SDI or the IRF system saves the root password as Ctrl D So I just changed the password on this iron on this, this Onyx/2 to to control D. And I\u2019m at this point I\u2019m like, Oh, no, I, you know, I just messed up the system, I need to tell the administrator of the system that by the way, the password is now control D. And\u00a0so I, you know, I\u2019m afraid of the system administrator, I\u2019m a small guy, I\u2019m five foot six, you know, at the time, I was probably 125 pounds and the sysadmin, I think his name was Dave. He didn\u2019t like me very much because I was this security dork, you know, who was running around trying to make systems more secure, and it was a big hassle. So it\u2019s like, okay, you know, I\u2019m going to have to face this guy. But instead, I talked to my friend, Donovan. Donovan, is, you know, six foot three, six foot four. He\u2019s a big guy. And I\u2019m like Donovan, can you do me a favor and go tell Dave that I changed the root password on the Onyx/2 to control D? And then I messed it up? He\u2019s like sure, I\u2019ll be right back. And I go over and wait and Donovan comes back a few minutes later. He\u2019s like, dude, he\u2019s like, they were so pissed. I was like, what happened? He said, you changed the password at the exact same time that they were about to log in and do a 3D demo for the U.S. Navy. And he was like, they couldn\u2019t log into the system. And they had to scrub the demo.And I\u2019m like, Are you kidding me? He\u2019s like, no, and there was a Navy Admiral in there. There was all this top brass on the Navy, there were there were top senior executives from from, Bath Iron Works and and he\u2019s like, they couldn\u2019t they couldn\u2019t log in. And I\u2019m like, oh, come on. This is really bad, I\u2019m gonna lose my job. I\u2019ve been on this job for maybe a month. I screwed it up. So I\u2019m sitting there. And I\u2019m like, all right, I should start thinking about how I\u2019m going to leave and pack up my stuff. And I don\u2019t have much stuff here. So it should be easy. And you know, half an hour later, my manager comes down. He\u2019s like, Larry, we need to talk. And I\u2019m like, crud. He\u2019s like, let\u2019s go to my manager\u2019s office. And I\u2019m like, Oh, man. So I go to his manager\u2019s office, and I go in the office, and I see this SANS security poster on the wall. And I\u2019m like, cool. This guy knows about security. He follows security stuff. And he and I sit down. I\u2019m like, Hi, you know, and he\u2019s like, so he\u2019s like, I heard you messed up the Onyx/2. And I\u2019m like, yeah. And he\u2019s like, well, he\u2019s like, I get security. He\u2019s like, you understand that, that, you know, security is important. But he said, From now on, I\u2019m going to need you to go and notify the system administrator, that you\u2019re going to do a penetration test on it, or that you\u2019re testing the system, and that you need to get permission from them when it\u2019s a good time to test it. And I\u2019m like, okay, I can do that. Yeah, he\u2019s like, and then I want you to, I want you to document everything you find, and I want you to send it to me in a report so that I can make sure that you know, the things that you found are documented, and that we know about it, and that, you know, I can I can task people to fix it. And I\u2019m like, great.So I walked out of there, and I had the sigh of relief, like, Alright, I\u2019m not going to get fired. And it also gave me a, it sort of gave me like a legitimacy, like now that my boss and my boss\u2019s boss know, that I do this sort of thing regularly \u2013 And now I just have a process for it \u2013 It gave me some more like power to say, \u201cHey, your systems being audited next week, you know, I\u2019m going to be doing it at this time. Is that is it available for testing? Or do you have another system I can test on?\u201d And it was, it was actually a win for me.LO: Right.LC: And I went on to, I can\u2019t tell you how many systems I had broken into and just, you know, exploited, you know, shell scripts that these guys were creating in /temp to get my privilege to root and, you know, I did all sorts of fun things back then it was it was like a, just a huge playground of hacking. And I was the only one in it. So it was it was a lot of fun. That was the first vulnerability and back then MITRE wasThe SGI IRIX Midikeys interface. Credit: Akamaisort of this mysterious entity to me, like I didn\u2019t know who they really were. And they just sort of assigned CVE IDs to worthy vulnerability. So I didn\u2019t even ask them to assign a CVE ID I just dropped the details of the vulnerability on Bugtrack. And then I found out later that SGI had issued a fix for it. And then MITRE had issued a CVE ID for it. And so I was so excited that I had my own, you know, CVE that I contributed to the hacking community, finding a vulnerability, a zero day that didn\u2019t exist. And I thought to myself, you know, if I if I ever find 10 of these, I\u2019m gonna make myself a T shirt. And here I am years later, I never made myself a T shirt, but I\u2019m way past 10 now.LO:\u00a0You got\u00a0to make t shirt.\u00a0I\u2019m sure the landscape was different back then. But you know, going into that office and expecting to get a slap on the wrist. But instead being met with more legitimacy as you, as you say, Yeah, I really like that story. And I know, too, you know, you were talking a little about reporting CVES to MITRE and I know, you know, they were that whole, the whole concept of CVES was introduced in the 1990s to, you know, really identify these these public software flaws, and especially as they were starting to increase in number and frequency. But now, you know, this system is really kind of an essential foundation for for managing for patching these these flaws. How have you seen that landscape shift over the years, since you first discovered this very, very first flaw, or very first CVE?LC:\u00a0When I was first, when I was first, a sysadmin, or an internet analyst, we would make sure that our systems were patched before we sent them out. And you just knew that, you know, if there was a buffer overflow for sendmail, you knew there was a patch for this sendmail code somewhere that you needed to apply. And, you know, I remember, you know, downloading patches from from the internet to apply to my sendmail source tree. And we\u2019re looking at each patch to make sure it didn\u2019t do anything weird or or nefarious, and then applying each patch, and then calling it good, but you didn\u2019t, you weren\u2019t able to identify which patch affected which specific vulnerability, there could be two buffer overflows and sendmail on two different variables. But you didn\u2019t know unless you looked at the patch, which one applied to which, so you knew, you\u2019d have to find out, what patch applied to which variable and was that the one that was wonderful for that version of that source code. With CVE, you could say, Oh, this patch addresses this CVE, and this CVE and this CVE, and you had a unique identifier for that specific vulnerability and just made things a lot easier. So it was it was, it was a nice thing to have, once that was developed. And you kind of thought, Well, why didn\u2019t this happen earlier? But, you know, it\u2019s just an evolution, I guess, of developing, you know, practices for security industry.LO: Right. Right. And I mean, kind of following up on that point. Have you also seen the whole \u00a0concept of responsible disclosure change and what that means from your standpoint?LC:\u00a0Yeah, I wasn\u2019t very good at responsible disclosure until about 2013, 2012. I would just literally find a vulnerability and throw it on Bugtrack. And I finally learned my lesson. It was December of I think, 2012. I was sent to Manhattan, to take a class on Centrify. Centrify is a software product that unifies desktop logins for Linux, you know, across Linux systems and Unix systems. And it ties it to I think it was either LDAP or AD, where you could use the credentials from an LDAP server or an AD server. And so I was, I was sent down to Manhattan to take the Centrify class, and I remember sitting in class, and I\u2019m not that interested in desktops, I like servers. So I\u2019m just like, this isn\u2019t that interesting. You know, it\u2019s just pretty much telling me how to click through and set this up. Because this software have any vulnerabilities on it? So I\u2019m like I\u2019m gonna start poking around as I install software and run it and watch you know, simple things like, you know, to create new accounts in etc/password, does it do any weird stuff in /temp, and I\u2019m looking around I see this, one of the products is creating these temp files. And I\u2019m like these, these temp files are being written in securely. And you know, if, if I write this file, first, I own the file so I can add to it. And look, the software is executing the shell script that it created in temp as root. So if I can add a command to that temp file before it creates a temp file, I\u2019ll get I\u2019ll get it to execute commands as root as a local user. So I spent, you know my time in class, documenting this vulnerability, and I spent time writing an exploit for it, instead of actually paying attention to the class, and then I actually remember I had to smuggle my source code out of the class because the class didn\u2019t have any network ability. It was a local network, there was no internet. I remember \u00a0they gave everyone a branded. It was a Centrify USB stick, and I think it was, I think it was 16 or 32 gigabytes, it was pretty big. I was pretty impressed with for that time, that size of the USB stick. I remember copying my source code and my advisory to it. And then going back to the hotel that night, and typing it up and dumping it on Bugtrack. And then you know, I just went to bed, and the next morning I get back to class. And then the teachers you know, once everybody settles in, he\u2019s like, so he\u2019s like, \u201cI hope everybody had a good evening last night. You know, folks enjoyed dinner, got dinner, and had a relaxing evening at your hotel\u201d and He\u2019s like, \u201cI know Larry had a good evening last night.\u201d I\u2019m like what? And he\u2019s like, \u201cIs there something you want to tell the class, Larry?\u201d And I\u2019m like, no. Like, I don\u2019t think I have something to tell. And he\u2019s like, I think you do. And he\u2019s like, \u201cweren\u2019t you up late last night, doing some hacking and putting things on Bugtrack?\u201d And I\u2019m like, oh, that Oh, yeah. He\u2019s like, \u201ccould you could you care to come to the front of the class and take this, this dry erase marker and tell us what you did last night? And why it\u2019s significant.\u201d And I\u2019m like, I\u2019m like, okay, so I started like, what to the, to the whiteboard, I start explaining to these guys, you know, about writing files and /temp and time of creation to time of use, and race conditions, and half the class didn\u2019t know what the hell I was talking about. The other class, the other half of the class was like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really cool. You know, that\u2019s, I never thought of that. That\u2019s neat.\u201d And then the teacher said, He\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, he\u2019s like, so last night, Larry found a security vulnerability in Centrify. And rather than Tell me about it, threw it on Bugtrack. And he\u2019s like, Larry, he\u2019s like, I work for a security company. We\u2019re all on Bugtrack.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI wish you would have told me about this first, so that I could have told, you know, my bosses about it, rather than all of us reading about it last night, and this morning,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I said, I\u2019m really, you know, I really didn\u2019t realize you know, how much of an impact this would be.\u201d And I said, \u201cit was pretty stupid to me to not think that any of you guys are on bug track, because you are a security company.\u201dSo I finished the class and I got home, I think, a day or two later, and my cell phone rings. And I\u2019m like, gee, why is my cell phone ringing with this number, and I pick it up, and it\u2019s a product manager at Centrify. And I\u2019m guessing I could put my cell phone number in the class signup sheet, because that\u2019s how he got it. And he\u2019s like, Larry, he\u2019s like, we really appreciate what you found. He\u2019s like, but next time, could you just give us a call to let us know what you found, instead of making it public. He\u2019s like, I had to call in my entire development software development team over the weekend. He\u2019s like, we\u2019re a week away from Christmas. He\u2019s like, they\u2019re not happy. They worked all weekend to fix this vulnerability that you found because we had to get this we had to get a patch immediately, because you put this exploit out in public.LO: Right.LC: He\u2019s like, I had customers calling me asking me like, you know what, what the fix was, and if we knew about it, he\u2019s like, it was just, it was like, it was a nightmare. And he\u2019s like, I really just, he\u2019s like, call me He\u2019s like, just let me help you find anything again. And I said, I\u2019m so sorry, sir. I said, I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m like, that was really stupid to me. I said, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t realize or I didn\u2019t think about how this could impact software developers, and how they would be yanked into work on this. And I said, I\u2019ll never do this again. Right. So that, I learned my lesson. From then on, I give software vendors, you know, two weeks to four weeks to respond. And then, you know, if they don\u2019t respond, then I\u2019ll make a public disclosure of it. But for the most part, you know, I think 99% of vendors I\u2019ve ever approached have been really great and supplied me with a patch. So it was, it was a learning experience, for sure.LO: Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s definitely a lesson learned. And, but that\u2019s, that\u2019s, you know, definitely positive news, though, that sounds like 90%, as you said, are mostly interacting and trying to push out a patch. That\u2019s always good. I also want to ask, you know, before we wrap up, I want to ask you about kind of the most unique story you have about finding a CVE and, you know, over over the years, what has really stuck out to you.LC: Yeah, back in 2000, I was working out I chased the dot com bubble out to California. I tripled my income by going from Maine to California in the security industry. And I was working for this small consulting company that was full of a bunch of mathematicians, they were doing all this statistical analysis of, I don\u2019t remember what, and I was this, I was a partner or I was assisted men with another guy. My friend who was is Kennedy, he was a new sysadmin. And I was at sort of a senior sysadmin. Back then, because it was the dot com bubble. And I had more than more than a year of experience with Unix. So people looked at me like I was the inventor of Unix back then, which was funny, kind of silly, right? And the director of the company approached me and she said, Hey, Larry, she was like, could you do us a big favor? She\u2019s like, we\u2019re looking to find some log analysis software for our web server. Now, back then, you know, venture capitalists, if you were trying to get money from them. They were like, well, how much traffic does your website get? And that was their metric for deciding if your company was sort of worth looking at. So everything was, you know, revolving around how many people were hitting your website, how long were they there for, you know, what links they click on, did they buy your product or look into your product or things like that. So I\u2019m like, okay, I can evaluate some software for you. And so the first software I looked at was Sawmill. So Sawmill is this log analysis tool, I think nowadays, it\u2019ll pretty much analyze any log file you want it to. But back then it was, you know, really specific towards Apache and in web server logs and, and syslogs and things like that. And I\u2019m like, well, I\u2019ll take a look at this, I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any security vulnerabilities. So I started up and I start poking around, and it\u2019s got this interface to it, where you can either browse the interface as a normal user, you know, unauthenticated, or you could browse the interface as an administrator and actually make changes to the software and, you know, execute commands and do things like that. So I was looking at, I noticed that it had, when you look to read a log file, you could click a link, and it would pull this log file up in your GET request as a query parameter. Like what if I put in a dot dot, and try and do path traversal? And sure enough, if I put in the dot, dot slash dot, dot slash etc/password, it read me the first line of the etc/password file, like, oh, wow, this thing actually does a patch traversal. So am I cool, I can read the first line of any system. So then I was looking at it locally on my, on my machine, and I noticed it created this admin.db file, I\u2019m like, well, what\u2019s this thing? So I opened the file up, and it, it looks like a hash, but it\u2019s really short. Like it looks like some sort of encrypted password. But it\u2019s only, you know, eight characters long. And I\u2019m like that\u2019s really small, it should be Oh, it\u2019s not a crypt hash, or an MD five or anything like that. So I type in my password, and I notice that the password that I created, it\u2019s the same length as this \u201cencrypted\u201d in quotes hash in this admin file. I\u2019m like, that\u2019s really weird. Is this a substitution cipher? So I delete my password, and I put the password in as A, and I look at the admin.db file, and it contains a capital Z. And I\u2019m like, Okay, so then I changed my password again to AB, and it has a capital Z and a lowercase C. And I\u2019m like, okay, so is this thing, just substituting stuff? So I put in A, C, A, C, and the admin.db file has capital Z, lowercase C, capital Z, lowercase C, and I\u2019m like, it is a substitution cipher. So I ran the strings command on the binary of this Sawmill software, and it spits out this array that was the actual substitution ciphers stored in an array. And I\u2019m like, so I can take this and I can write a program to decrypt any password that\u2019s put in that file. So this is 2000. So I took my Palm Pilot 3XE, and I wrote a program in Palm C on it to decrypt\u00a0the file or decrypt the password hash, and give me the clear text. And I tested it on my on my thing, and it worked. I put in the password password, I decrypted the hash string or the cipher string, and it came out as password. So I\u2019m like neat. So what I end up doing, instead of telling the vendor about it, or the actual Sawmill, guys, I go to their website, I use the path traversal bug to grab the first line of the admin file, the admin dot DB, take their cipher string, stick it in my little decrypter password file, which was actually the password was \u201cWookie,\u201d login as the administrator and their administrator panel on their website, where I then could execute commands on the system as root. So then I tell the software, the owner of the company, or the the guy who was developing the software, hey, I found this hack in your, in your Sawmill product for version 5.X, where I can decrypt your password and I can use path traversal to grab your administrative database file. And by the way, I logged in your website, decrypted your password file, it\u2019s \u201cWookie.\u201d Here\u2019s all the details and the guy was happy. And he\u2019s like, that\u2019s great hacking. He\u2019s like, that\u2019s awesome hacking dude. He\u2019s like, thanks for telling me. And he\u2019s like, I\u2019m gonna give you a free software license.And I\u2019m like, Great, thanks. So yeah, he writes a patch, releases a new software version sends me the the key to get the license. I go back to my to the director of the company. I said, Hey, I got you this software for free because I found a vulnerability and here\u2019s a license. Why don\u2019t you buy me lunch someday? And she\u2019s like, oh, thank you so much, great work and looking back on it. It\u2019s like, I was in my 20s and I was reckless and stupid. You know, it\u2019s literally that\u2019s you can\u2019t log into someone system and decrypt their password. And like, it\u2019s that\u2019s illegal. It\u2019s like, what was I thinking?LO:\u00a0Definitely got lucky there.LC: Yeah, definitely got lucky there. So that\u2019s where, you know, actually responsible disclosure comes in where it\u2019s now like, okay, you do not use a vulnerability found against the company that has developed the software, you tell them about it responsibly. And then, you know, give them time to, to, to respond to your request. And then, you know, work with them on it don\u2019t actually demonstrate it on their own infrastructure.LO: Right. That\u2019s really I mean, that\u2019s, that\u2019s something that is, you know, is good advice, and kind of a good takeaway of this. But do you have any other advice for others, security researchers who are looking for vulnerabilities who are reporting flaws, and anything that you\u2019ve really learned over the past few decades?LC: Oh, yeah, I, you know, I generally, for me, it wasn\u2019t for monetary gain, it was for the thrill of the hunt. You know, I really enjoyed finding security vulnerabilities that were there puzzles for me and exploiting them. And that just it, it gave me the warm fuzzies. I wasn\u2019t really looking for monetary gain. And I think nowadays, there\u2019s a lot of bug bounty hunters out there that are looking to make money doing this. And it makes sense, I understand that. But I think you have to be careful if the company doesn\u2019t have a bug bounty program, and they say, hey, look, you know, we\u2019re sorry, we don\u2019t have a bug bounty program, we can send you a couple of T shirts, and a water bottle, and some swag, some stickers, but that\u2019s about it. Don\u2019t get upset or offended that they don\u2019t have a bug bounty program, it will probably happen someday. But you know, don\u2019t get upset with them. And you can\u2019t say, well, then I\u2019m not going to give you the details of this vulnerability, unless you give me money, because then that turns into extortion. So you just have to be careful, and, just walk the line of do no harm. And then for vendors, or software vendors, if somebody approaches you and says, Hey, I found a vulnerability, don\u2019t get mad at them, and don\u2019t threaten to sue them \u2013 work with them, because they\u2019ve literally found something that you probably didn\u2019t notice. And they\u2019re trying to help your software become better. So, you know, don\u2019t get angry or upset with them. I haven\u2019t experienced that too much myself. But it does happen. I\u2019ve seen researchers where they\u2019ve gotten sued, or threatened legal action against them for finding security vulnerabilities.LO: \u00a0Right, right. Well, Larry, thank you so much for coming on to share some of your experiences over the years and talking a little bit about what you found.LC:\u00a0Yeah.LO: And that to all of our listeners at once again, this is Lindsay O\u2019Donnell Welch with threat post here with Larry Cashdollar with Akamai.

        "raw text": "German authorities have taken down the Hydra marketplace \u2013 a popular destination on the Dark Web for trading in illicit goods and services, including cyberattack tools and stolen data.This week, they were able to commandeer and take offline underpinning infrastructure such as servers, plus install a takedown banner in place of a working website, all while seizing $25 million (\u20ac23 million) in funds in the process.\u201cThe illegal marketplace was a Russian-language Darknet platform that had been accessible via the Tor network since at least 2015,\u201d according to a Tuesday statement from Frankfurt\u2019s public prosecutor (ZIT) and Germany\u2019s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA). \u201cTheir focus was on trading in illegal narcotics. In addition, data spied out worldwide, forged documents and digital services were offered profitably via the platform.\u201dSecurity firm Elliptic said that it confirmed the seizure, which occurred on April 5 in a series of 88 transactions amounting to 543.3 BTC, according to a post about the Hydra crackdown on Tuesday. It also said that since its inception, Hydra has pulled in around $5 billion in Bitcoin.The banner that site visitors now see. Source: BKA.The takedown operation has been in motion since last August, according to the notice, and included cooperation from American authorities. The investigation found that Hydra had 17 million customer accounts and boasted more than 19,000 registered sellers, with a global turnover of $1.34 billion (\u20ac1.23 billion) just in 2020. alone. Finding that information was not easy, the agencies noted.\u201cIn particular, the Bitcoin Bank Mixer, a service for obfuscating digital transactions provided by the platform, made crypto-investigations extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies,\u201d the posting noted. In the end they discovered that \u201cHydra\u2026was probably the illegal marketplace with the highest turnover worldwide.\u201dProsecutors are charging Hydra operators and administrators with charges of: commercially operating a criminal trading platform on the internet; the commercial procurement or granting of an opportunity for the unauthorized purchase or the unauthorized sale of narcotics; and commercial money laundering.Cracking Down on Illegal Dark MarketsGiven their status as linchpins of the Dark Web underground economy for cybercriminals and narcotics traders alike, international authorities have continued to put effort into dismantling underground markets.One of the earliest wins was the dismantling of Joker\u2019s Stash in late 2020. It was a popular cybercriminal destination that specialized in trading in payment-card data, offering millions of stolen credit and debit cards to buyers. Anyone purchasing the information can create cloned cards to physically use at ATMs or at in-store machines that aren\u2019t chip-enabled; or, they can simply use the information to buy things online. Law enforcement managed to disable its blockchain DNS sites as well as Tor addresses.Then last year, Europol announced the takedown of DarkMarket, which according to the law enforcement agency was \u201cthe world\u2019s largest illegal marketplace on the Dark Web.\u201dDarkMarket served as a marketplace for cybercriminals to buy and sell drugs, counterfeit money, stolen or counterfeit credit card data, anonymous SIM cards and malware. According to Europol, DarkMarket had almost 500,000 users and more than 2,400 sellers at the time of closure.In addition, \u201cseveral darknet services have also voluntarily closed down over the winter of 2021-22,\u201d according Elliptic.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The latest installment of the Dark Souls gaming franchise, Elden Ring, contains a security vulnerability that allows bad actors to throw players on PCs into an endless loop of losing their characters\u2019 lives, rendering it essentially unplayable.Malwarebytes Labs researcher Christopher Boyd said Thursday that the bug appears to be a remote code-execution flaw that is being exploited to render the game unplayable for victims.The late February release of Elden Ring went off smoothly for a time, and PC players were able to access online play without incident. In fact, on March 16, the Tokyo-based company announced that the sandbox game had sold 1 million units in Japan and more than 12 million worldwide.The backstory behind Elden Ring was written by George R.R. Martin, the author of the book used as the source material create the hit television epic, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s astonishing to see just how many people have been playing \u2018Elden Ring,'\u201d FromSoftware CEO Hidetaka Miyazaki said. \u201cI\u2019d like to extend our heartfelt thanks on behalf of the entire development team. \u2018Elden Ring\u2019 is based on a mythological story written by George R. R. Martin. We hope players enjoy a high level of freedom when adventuring through its vast world, exploring its many secrets, and facing up to its many threats.\u201dElden Ring\u2019s \u2018Death Loop\u2019 The smooth sailing ended about a week ago, when attackers found a way to break into PC players\u2019 games and throw their avatars into an endless loop of dying, coming back and quickly dying again, something Boyd referred to as a \u201cdeath loop.\u201d\u201cAfter the first time your character dies, you\u2019re supposed to respawn at locations resembling a bonfire, Instead, in the death loop scenario the victim simply continues to die over and over again,\u201d Boyd explained.One player tweeted about the bug in the latest Souls\u2019 game.\u201cThere\u2019s an exploit going around on PC where hackers will corrupt your save file while you\u2019re invaded,\u201d the player tweeted. \u201cFirst, they will crash your game, and when you open it back up, your character will be constantly falling to their death\u2026\u201d\u26a0\ufe0fElden Ring PSA for PC players\u26a0\ufe0fThere's an exploit going around on PC where hackers will corrupt your save file while you're invaded. First they will crash your game, and when you open it back up, your character will be constantly falling to their death\u2026 pic.twitter.com/8et3bl8T1I\u2014 Mordecai (@EldenRingUpdate) March 18, 2022Boyd said no one is exactly sure what\u2019s going on, since FromSoftware hasn\u2019t released any specifics about the exploit.\u201cOne of the theories from players is that the invaders were able to edit their save files somehow while in game, or at least adjust some parameters related to the victim\u2019s save points,\u201d Boyd added. \u201cIn other words: You no longer spawn at the nearest bonfire. You respawn somewhere over the nearby ocean and die instantly on account of not being able to swim.\u201dThe only way for PC players to completely avoid the possibility of falling victim to the bug is to switch off online play, Boyd advised.\u201cAnyone trapped in a death loop has to attempt an ALT + F4/rapid-fire sequence of button presses in menus to try to manually respawn at a bonfire,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cThis, as it turns out, isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201dThe good news is that FromSoftware has released an Elden Ring patch for this exploit, as well as others impacting players. Players without the update will be barred from online play, the company added.Other Dark Nights of the Soul for Dark SoulsThis isn\u2019t the first time that the developer has faced issues with the Dark Souls series. Boyd pointed out that in January, leading up to the Elden Ring release, developer FromSoftware was confronted with a similar RCE exploit in Dark Souls 3 that forced it to shut down online play for PC players.The flaw could allow attackers to do pretty much anything: As Kaspersky researchers\u00a0explained at the time, the bug \u201callows an attacker to execute almost any program on the victim\u2019s computer, so they\u2019re able to steal confidential data or execute any program they wish\u201d \u2013 that includes installing malware, letting them access sensitive information or enabling them to rip off resources for cryptocurrency mining.The vulnerability also affected earlier games in the Dark Soul series, leading the developers to temporarily turn off player-versus-player (PvP) servers across Dark Souls Remastered, Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III. PvP refers to players being able to interact and duel with each other.\u201cHopefully the last we\u2019ll see of game invading/save locking/character murdering exploits along these lines,\u201d Boyd explained. \u201cSave points in Souls titles are supposed to be the one safe breathing space in the entire game. To have them corrupted or tampered with and cursed with instant death is probably a bridge too far for even the most hardcore of Souls players.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Nearly 500 malicious apps lurking on the Google Play Store have successfully installed Dark Herring malware \u2014 a cash-stealer intended to add sneaky charges onto mobile carrier bills \u2014 on more than 100 million Android devices across the globe.That\u2019s quite a school of fish.Dark Herring malware was discovered by a research team with Zimperium, who estimate the amount the campaign has been able to steal totals in the hundreds of millions, in increments of $15 a month per victim. Google has since removed all 470 malicious applications from the Play Store, and the firm said the scam services are down, but any user with one of the apps already installed could still be actively victimized down the road. The apps are still available in third-party app stores too.Consumers across the world, particularly in under-banked areas, rely on direct carrier billing (DCB) as a mobile payment method, which adds charges for non-telecom services onto a consumer\u2019s monthly phone bill. It\u2019s a juicy target for adversaries.In this case, the errant $15 charge isn\u2019t necessarily enough for an end user to notice it for several months, but multiplied across more than 100 million accounts, the ill-gotten gains quickly added up, the report explained.\u201cThe download statistics reveal that\u00a0more than 105 million Android devices had this malware installed, falling victim to this campaign globally, potentially suffering incalculable financial losses,\u201d Zimperium\u2019s report said. \u201cThe cybercriminal group behind this campaign has built a stable cash flow of illicit funds from these victims, generating millions in recurring revenue each month, with the total amount stolen potentially well into the hundreds of millions.\u201dThe campaign was first detected back in March of 2020 and ran actively through last November, the report said.The Zimperium analysts who identified Dark Herring said that the scamware is likely the work of a new group, which uses novel techniques and infrastructure.Dark Herring\u2019s World Domination\u00a0\u00a0Dark Herring\u2019s triumph was the result of a combination of savvy tactics, the analysts said; namely, the use of geo-targeting to deliver the application in the victim\u2019s native language.\u201cThis social-engineering trick is exceptionally successful and effective as users are generally more comfortable with sharing information to a website in their local language,\u201d the team added. \u201cThe campaign is exceptionally versatile, targeting mobile users from 70+ countries by changing the application\u2019s language, and displaying the content according to the current user\u2019s IP address.\u201dThe group behind Dark Herring also managed to stand up 470 high-quality applications that passed official app store muster, which demonstrates that this is a sophisticated operation, analysts noted. The apps all functioned as advertised, and were spread over a wide range of categories.Source: Zimperium.\u201cProducing a large number of malicious applications and submitting them to app stores points to an extensive, concerted effort by a well-organized group,\u201d the report explained. \u201cThese apps are not just clones of each other or other apps, but are uniquely produced at a high rate to deceive traditional security toolsets and the potential victims.\u201dBesides a robust infrastructure, the Dark Herring\u2019s campaign uses proxies as first-stage URLs to help avoid detection; and thanks to those geo-targeting capabilities, was able to narrow the search for the most prime victims.For instance, attackers tended to focus on users in countries with less stringent consumer protections for telecommunications users, including Egypt, Finland, India, Pakistan and Sweden, the researchers found.Source: Zimperium.\u201cDue to the nature of DCB, some countries might have been targeted with less success than others due to the consumer protections set in place by telcos,\u201d the report said.On the technical side, once the Android application is installed and launched, a first-stage URL is loaded into a webview, which is hosted on Cloudfront, researchers said. The malware then sends an initial GET request to that URL, which sends back a response containing links to JavaScript files hosted on Amazon Web Services cloud instances.The application then fetches these resources, which it needs to proceed with the infection process \u2014 and specifically, to enable geo-targeting.\u201cOne of the JavaScript files instructs the application to get a unique identifier for the device by making a POST request to the \u201clive/keylookup\u201d API endpoint and then constructing a final-stage URL,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThe baseurl variable is used to make a POST request that contains unique identifiers created by the application, to identify the device and the language and country details.\u201dThe response from that final-stage URL contains the configuration that the application will use to dictate its behavior, based on the victim\u2019s details. Based on this configuration, a mobile webpage displayed to the victim, asking them to submit their phone number to activate the app (and the DCB charges). This page is customized in terms of the language of the text, flag shown and country code.Thanks to the steady revenue stream, Dark Herring is a well-funded operation.\u00a0\u201cThe evidence also points to a significant financial investment from the malicious actors in building and maintaining the infrastructure to keep this global scam operating at such a high pace,\u201d the report said.Given its Dark Herring\u2019s clear achievements, Zimperium said that it seems unlikely this will be the last the cybersecurity community hears from this cybercrime group.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.News",

        "raw text": "There\u2019s a dangerous remote-code execution (RCE) bug in the Dark Souls video game that could let attackers brick the PCs of online players.The flaw could allow attackers to do pretty much anything: As Kaspersky researchers explained on Monday, the bug \u201callows an attacker to execute almost any program on the victim\u2019s computer, so they\u2019re able to steal confidential data or execute any program they wish\u201d \u2013 that includes installing malware, letting them access sensitive information or enabling them to rip off resources for cryptocurrency mining.The main problem is with Dark Souls III, but the remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerability also affects earlier games in the Dark Soul series, leading the developers to temporarily turn off player-versus-player (PvP) servers across Dark Souls Remastered, Dark Souls II and Dark Souls III. PvP refers to players being able to interact and duel with each other.This same bug is reportedly an issue in the Elden Ring game.\nOn Sunday, the developers said that the bug is only relevant for PC users and that Xbox and PlayStation consoles are unaffected.PvP servers for Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls: Remastered have been temporarily deactivated to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services. Servers for Dark Souls: PtDE will join them shortly.We apologize for this inconvenience.\u2014 Dark Souls (@DarkSoulsGame) January 23, 2022The danger was brought to light on Saturday, when game fan SkeleMann urged players to steer clear of playing Dark Souls 3 online. \u201cOn PC there is a new, very serious exploit plaguing Dark Souls 3 which can cause lasting damage to your computer,\u201d SkeleMann explained. \u201cThis could brick your PC, let your login information be shared or execute programs in the background, like a trojan horse.\u201dThere\u2019s a demonstration of the exploit in the Twitch stream of a player named The_Grim_Sleeper. In that stream, an unknown party launched a PowerShell script on the streamer\u2019s computer that used the Windows Narrator engine to read out critical notes about the gameplay.Whoever\u2019s behind the attack apparently had benign intentions: According to a screenshotted post on the SpeedSouls\u2019 Discord \u2013 a group focused on speedrunning, or playing video games as fast as possible \u2013 they were just trying to bring attention to the problem after having not heard back from the game\u2019s developers about the vulnerability. Since they hadn\u2019t heard back, they decided to hijack a popular streamer during a streaming session.like a Trojan Horse. And more nasty stuff.It's highly suggested to NOT PLAY ONLINE DARK SOULS 3 in it's current state. Avoid any online activity from Ds3.In addition, if you haven't already everybody and their mother can recommend the Blue Sentinel modhttps://t.co/lposZRzbr1\u2014 SkeleMann (@SkeleMann) January 22, 2022That doesn\u2019t mean that the bug won\u2019t be abused at some point, Kaspersky pointed out. \u201cFor example, the creator of the exploit has already shared information about the vulnerability with the developers of the Blue Sentinel plugin, a mod for Dark Souls designed to counteract cheats,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAnd one can only guess who else could get this information.\u201cAlso, once demonstrated, other hackers may try to replicate the exploit and use it to cause real harm to players,\u201d researchers continued. \u201cThere are various possible scenarios here: attackers can use it to steal passwords from game accounts or crypto-wallets, install good old ransomware, hidden miners and much more.\u201dHow Gaming Brings Risk to Corporate NetworksSaryu Nayyar, CEO and founder of Gurucul, noted that this attack points to the risk of remote workers using home networks and personal devices to access corporate resources.\u201cAs we connect our gaming systems to the same network as resources that attach to the corporate network, the infection can easily spread from home to a much bigger operation,\u201d she noted.That\u2019s why it\u2019s critical for security teams to understand how users are accessing network resources and to incorporate that information into an assessment of the risks and the severity associated with attack campaigns, she added. \u201cThis is where identity, and specifically access analytics, incorporated into next-generation [security information and event management or SIEM] can narrow down indicators of compromise and determine malicious behaviors hiding as authorized user activity.\u201dRCE vulnerabilities are nothing new, but they\u2019re dangerous when no one knows they exist, noted Jorge Orchilles, CTO of SCYTHE.\u201cWe see threat actors use RCEs all the time, especially when the vulnerabilities do not have a patch available,\u201d he told Threatpost on Monday.Companies affected by these types of vulnerabilities \u201cneed to take immediate action to protect their customers by releasing patches,\u201d he stressed. \u201cMeanwhile, gamers affected should monitor their systems for abnormal activity such as crypto-miners.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

So far, it looks like the cybercrooks have made off with more than $500,000 and counting.The ads serve links to purportedly download popular cryptowallets Phantom and MetaMask, according to a new report from Check Point Research.\u201cOver the past weekend, Check Point Research encountered hundreds of incidents in which crypto-investors lost their money while trying to download and install well known cryptowallets or change their currencies on crypto-swap platforms like PancakeSwap or Uniswap,\u201d Check Point analysts said.Attackers started by putting Google Ads to work searching for potential victims, the report explained. Clicking on the malicious Google Ad takes the user to a malicious site doctored to look like the Phantom (or sometimes MetaMask) wallet site, Check Point noted.Phantom & MetaMask There, the target is prompted to create a new account using a \u201cSecret Recovery Phrase.\u201d They\u2019re also prompted to set a password for the purported account (which is harvested by the attackers). After that, users are given a keyboard shortcut for opening the wallet and then redirected to the legitimate Phantom site, Check Point explained.The legitimate site offers users the Phantom wallet Google Chrome extension.\u201cNow if the user adds the Chrome wallet tab to their browser and inserts the newly created recovery phrase from the attacker, they actually log in to the attacker\u2019s wallet instead of creating a new one,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis means if they transfer any funds, the attacker will get that immediately.\u201dThe scam was uncovered as complaints from duped victims started to emerge on Reddit and Twitter, Check Point noted.\u201cHey I just installed the phantom wallet and somehow I ended up downloading the scam,\u201d a user with the screen name \u201cSpookster510\u201d wrote. \u201cI am somewhat new to wallet and thought at first it was like a demo number about of Sol on the wallet to show what it looks like but then realized it was someone else\u2019s wallet I was in.\u201dCrypto-criminals also targeted MetaMask wallets, buying Google Ads that took victims to a malicious site that looked like the legitimate MetaMask site.\u201cIn this case, the attacker also tries to steal the user\u2019s private key to steal their wallet if they have one, or give them a phrase that enables them to steal the funds upon transfer,\u201d the report added.Scammers Using Google to Spot Victims Fanatic interest in all things crypto in some corners of the internet aside, it should be noted that Google Ads are increasingly being abused to find targets for many kinds of fraud.For instance, underscoring how easy it is to leverage Google Ads for criminal enterprise, a teenager was recently arrested after he bought enough Google Ads to rank his malicious link above its legitimate gift card site counterpart. He managed to steal $9,000 before being shut down.Google continues to pledge increased resources to rooting out abuse on its platform. Google didn\u2019t respond to Threatpost\u2019s request for comment on this particular scam, but told the publication in late October that\u00a0\u201cour goal is to create a safe and trustworthy experience for users. We take matters of ad fraud very seriously and continue to vigorously enforce our policies and be nimble when faced with new threats.\u201dCybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "The prolific ransomware group that rose from the ashes of DarkSide appears to be going dark\u2014again. BlackMatter said it will shut down due to increased pressure from authorities, according to a message posted on its website.VX-Underground, which aggregates a collection of malware source code, samples and assorted resources, posted a screenshot of the Russian-language message, on its Twitter feed. It also posted an English translation.\u201cDue to certain unsolvable circumstances associated with pressure from the authorities (part of the team is no longer available, after the latest news) \u2013 the project is closed,\u201d the message said.BlackMatter, which operates as a ransomware as a service (RaaS) operation, will still allow its infrastructure to issue mail to companies for further communication as well as permit its affiliates to get a decryptor for its ransomware, according to the message.\u201cFor this write \u2018give a decryptor\u2019 inside the company chat, where necessary,\u201d the message read. \u201cWe wish you all success, we were glad to work.\u201dVX-Underground told BleepingComputer that the message was sent to the organization directly from BlackMatter, according to a published report.Arrests Spur Shutdown?The group didn\u2019t mention what the \u201clatest news\u201d that inspired it to close its doors. However, the culprit could be Europol\u2019s apprehension last week of 12 individuals allegedly responsible for \u201cwreaking havoc across the world with ransomware attacks against critical infrastructure,\u201d according to an agency press release.The EU\u2019s top law-enforcement agency arrested the so-called \u201chigh-value targets\u201d for ransomware cybercrime perpetrated across 17 countries in Ukraine and Switzerland on Oct. 26, Europol said in the release.The individuals were not named and were said to have different roles in their respective criminal organizations, according to Interpol. Therefore, it\u2019s unclear if the member of the BlackMatter team who \u201cis no longer available\u201d is one of those who was apprehended.However, the shutdown of BlackMatter\u2019s predecessor DarkSide ransomware\u2014perhaps most infamous for its disruptive attack on Colonial Pipeline\u2014also occurred after a raid by authorities. Experts believe the two events are be connected.Key Ransomware Threat Retired\u2014For NowBlackMatter emerged in July shortly after and made its presence on the ransomware scene known in just a short time. In September alone the group struck three times, targeting Japanese tech giant Olympus and two agricultural cooperatives in the United States\u2014Iowa-based farmers feed and grain cooperative NEW Cooperative and Minnesota-based supply and grain marketing cooperative Crystal Valley.The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), FBI and the National Security Agency (NSA) officially warned only a few weeks ago that BlackMatter was poised to spring its ransomware on even more victims, advising businesses to shore up their security defenses and monitor networks carefully for any unusual activity.That threat of activity appears to be dimmer for now, although BlackMatter\u2019s affiliates can still carry out its nefarious activity given that they can still receive its decryptor by staying in contact with the gang.Moreover, if history is any indication, BlackMatter\u2019s remaining crew will likely regroup and restart its ransomware activity again under a new identity in the future. Other ransomware gangs that shut down in the past also eventually reemerged under a different name, including Maze, which resurfaced as Egregor; and Bitpaymer, which morphed into DoppelPaymer and now operates as Grief, which recently reportedly targeted the National Rifle Association.News",

        "raw text": "Threat actors have leaked 1 million stolen credit cards for free online as a way to promote a fairly new and increasingly popular cybercriminal site dedicated to\u2026selling payment-card credentials.Researchers from threat intelligence firm Cyble noticed the leak of the payment-card data during a \u201croutine monitoring of cybercrime and Dark Web marketplaces,\u201d researchers said in a post published over the weekend. The cards were published on an underground card-selling market, AllWorld.Cards, and stolen between 2018 and 2019, according to info posted on the forum.The leaked credit cards include the following fields: Credit-card number, expiration date, CVV, name, country, state, city, address, ZIP code, email and phone number, according to threat actors.AllWorld.Cards appears to be a relatively new player to the market for selling stolen credit-card data on the Dark Web, according to Cyble. \u201cOur analysis suggests that this market has been around since May 2021 and is available on a Tor channel as well,\u201d according to the post.The black market for stolen credit cards is a massive illegal business, with cybercriminals getting their hands on card data in a number of ways. Point-of-sale card skimmers, targeted Magecart attacks on websites and info-stealing trojans are among their top tools for stealing credit-card data.Indeed, in the last six months of 2020 alone, threat actors offered more than 45 million compromised cards for sale in underground credit-card markets monitored by security firm Cybersixgill, the company said in a report. These cards are then used by cybercriminals to make online purchases, including buying gift cards, that are hard to track back to them.How Many Cards Are Still Active?The curators of AllWorld.Cards began flogging their cybercriminal services on carding sites in early June, ostensibly to drum up new business, researchers from Italian firm D3 Lab noted in a separate blog post detailing the leak, published last Friday.\u201cIt is conceivable that the data was shared for free to entice other criminal actors to frequent their site\u2026by purchasing additional stolen data from unsuspecting victims,\u201d according to the post (machine-translated from Italian).There is some uncertainty about how many of the cards are actually still active and available for cybercriminals to use. Cyble researchers noted that threat actors claimed that 27 percent, according to a random sampling of 98 cards, are still active and can be used for illegal purchasing.However, according to D3 Lab\u2019s own analysis\u2014which involved sending the credit-card numbers to client banks \u201cto carry out the appropriate mitigation actions\u201d \u2014 researchers found that closer to 50 percent of the cards are \u201cstill operational, not yet identified as compromised,\u201d they said.Cyble posted a list of the top 500 banks affected by the leak of stolen credit cards in descending order. Of the banks, 72,937 of the cards were associated the State Bank of India; 38,010 with Banco Santander (Brazil); 30480 with a U.S. bank based in Ohio called Sutton Bank; 27,441 with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A.; and 24,307 with BBVA Bancomer S.A., a bank based in Mexico.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "The VPN provider known as LimeVPN has been hit with a hack affecting 69,400 user records, according to researchers.A hacker claims to have stolen the company\u2019s entire customer database before knocking its website offline (Threatpost confirmed that as of press time, the website was down). The stolen records consist of user names, passwords in plain text, IP addresses and billing information, according to PrivacySharks. Researchers added the attack also included public and private keys of LimeVPN users.\u201cThe hacker informed us that they have the private keys of every user, which is a serious security issue as it means they can easily decrypt every LimeVPN user\u2019s traffic,\u201d the firm said in a posting.The potential for decryption is worrying, experts say, given that VPNs tunnel all of their users\u2019 internet traffic, which is a potential gold mine of information for cyberattackers.The whole purported cache has been put up for sale on the hacker destination RaidForums. The hacker, who goes by the handle \u201cslashx,\u201d originally said the database consisted of 10,000 records for $400 (on Tuesday) before expanding the tally (on Wednesday). Slashx told researchers that the heist was carried out via a security breach rather than any connection with an insider threat or older hack.Then, on Thursday, the site went offline \u2014 with an apparent malware infection in play. \u201cWorryingly, our access was blocked by Malwarebytes [antivirus protection] due to a potential trojan found on the site,\u201d PrivacySharks said.LimeVPN Confirms Breach to ResearchersTelegram chat with \u201cslashx\u201d. Source: PrivacySharksA PrivacySharks spokesperson told Threatpost that LimeVPN confirmed that there has been a data incident, and that the hacker who stole the database also claimed responsibility for the site being down. And the firm RestorePrivacy, which separately confirmed the leak, noted that LimeVPN told it that \u201cour backup server has been hacked\u201d and that it has \u201creset our access credentials and started a system audit.\u201dThreatpost has also reached out to LimeVPN for comment, but no response has yet been forthcoming.Sample Review of Stolen DataBoth sets of researchers made contact with the perpetrator and reviewed samples of the alleged collected data.Another chat. Source: RestorePrivacyWhen analyzing the available sample data provided by slashx, RestorePrivacy researchers noticed that transaction details for users buying the service were available (as in dollar amounts and payment method), but actual payment-card data or bank details are not included.\u201cThis is because the VPN uses a third-party payment processor called WHMCS,\u201d the firm noted. \u201cHowever, the hacker claims to have obtained the entire WHMCS database with the LimeVPN hack.\u201dSome of the transactions in the sample date up to this week, and include the full names of current subscribers, both firms found.Source: RestorePrivacy\u201cEven though LimeVPN is not a large provider like Surfshark or NordVPN, the fact that its entire database was scraped raises the question of security among VPN providers,\u201d Cliff Durward, PrivacySharks\u2019 head of security, told Threatpost. \u201cAlthough most VPN companies, like LimeVPN, employ no-logs policies, identifiable data such as email addresses and payment information can still be stolen and sold if security breaches occur.\u201dNo Logs?LimeVPN, like many other providers, advertises a log-less service, meaning that it doesn\u2019t track its users or keep personal data on them. But the very existence of the allegedly stolen records and the database calls that proposition into question, researchers said.\u201cIt is not entirely clear from the data we were provided if LimeVPN is collecting usage or connection logs from their users,\u201d according to RestorePrivacy. \u201cAnd we were not willing to pay the $400 in Bitcoin to see all data. Nonetheless, this incident looks to be a major blow to the VPN service\u2019s reputation.\u201dPrivacySharks had a similar take: \u201cLimeVPN\u2019s no-logs policy will also be thrown into question since this massive data breach may lead some users to question how much of their data the company actually stores. Without an independent audit of the provider\u2019s privacy policy, the phrase \u2018no-logs\u2019 doesn\u2019t have much weight, and the current situation will cause a lot of skepticism from customers.\u201dLimeVPN did not respond to Threatpost\u2019s query about its logging policies and practices.What LimeVPN Users Should DoAs with the recent LinkedIn data-scraping incident, the information allegedly contained in the collection could potentially be used to carry out a variety of social-engineering attacks, including mounting phishing efforts and more.\u201cHackers can take information to build profiles on individuals, making it easier to find out more details, leading to identity theft, fraud or scams,\u201d PrivacySharks noted. \u201cFor this reason, it is important to be vigilant when creating online accounts with your personal details.\u201dPrivacySharks recommended that users change their passwords and freeze/replace their credit cards. It\u2019s also a good idea to change passwords and activate two-factor authentication on other accounts that may use the same credentials, and consider using \u201cburner\u201d email addresses for high-risk accounts.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.BreachHacksPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Broadband providers and a 19-year-old college student were among those who successfully hijacked public comments during a crucial decision-making process in 2017 to overturn net neutrality by flooding the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with fraudulent comments indicating their position on the move, according to a new report.A secret campaign by the broadband industry to offer support to roll back net neutrality resulted in fake comments comprising more than 40 percent of those sent to the FCC during the public comments phase of its decision, according to the report by the New York State Office of the Attorney General.The industry also sent more than half a million fake letters to Congress to \u201ccreate the appearance of widespread grassroots opposition to existing net neutrality rules, which as described in an internal campaign planning document would help provide \u2018cover\u2019 for the FCC\u2019s proposed repeal,\u201d according to the report \u201cFake Comments: How U.S. Companies and Partisans Hack Democracy to Undermine Your Voice\u201d, published online Thursday.Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.On the other side of the debate, a 19-year-old college student who opposed the repeal of net neutrality managed to file more than 7.7 million pro-neutrality comments with the FCC by fabricating people\u2019s names and addresses using software. Meanwhile, another group of 1.6 million pro-neutrality comments of an undetermined source were submitted using fictitious identities.Fake-Comment FestOverall, the Office of the New York Attorney General (OAG) found that fake comments accounted for nearly 18 million of the more than 22 million comments the FCC received during its 2017 rulemaking.\u201cThis type of fraud has significant consequences for our democracy,\u201d the AG\u2019s office said in the report. \u201cFederal and state agencies rely on public comments to set standards that govern many aspects of our lives, from public health to consumer protection to the environment, and, in this case, the rules that govern how we share and consume content over the internet.\u201dPublic comments can also influence legislators and play a role in creating the laws that are later enacted, so sabotaging the process also undermines the democratic legislative process in the United States, according to the report.Net neutrality is the principle that ISPs treat all content going over the internet equally and not give preference to some digital content from certain providers. President Obama ostensibly put net neutrality rules into effect in 2015 when the FCC voted to classify consumer broadband service as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act. Under that law, the FCC adopted a policy that traffic could not be blocked or disrupted; nor could providers pay to prioritize their content.However, the FCC under President Trump repealed net neutrality with a replacement rule crafted in 2017 called the Restoring Internet Freedom Order. At the time, a united coalition of net neutrality supporters \u2013 including 20 state attorneys general, consumer groups, and companies such as Vimeo, Netflix and Sonos \u2013 pushed back with legal challenges against the order, which in the end were not successful at the federal level. California later passed its own net neutrality law, butting heads with the feds over the issue.The report now makes it abundantly clear that FCC regulators were deliberately misled during the public comments period in the lead-up to the net-neutrality repeal and may have been unduly influenced during their decision-making.Bogus Comments from Both SidesOn one side, the three largest telecom companies in the United States and an industry trade group \u2013 all of whom had a vested interest in seeing net neutrality fail \u2013 tried to manufacture support for repeal by paying lead-generating companies to create comments in support of the repeal.Among the actions taken by these third-party companies were to submit comments through a process called \u201cco-registration.\u201d This encouraged consumers to join in the campaign by promising people \u201cgift cards and sweepstakes entries.\u201d The companies then used the names of those consumers to craft and submit responses in support of the rollback without those people\u2019s knowledge.\u201cNearly every lead generator that was engaged to enroll consumers in the broadband industry\u2019s campaign fabricated consumers\u2019 responses to the campaign,\u201d according to the report. \u201cMost never even ran the broadband industry\u2019s campaign solicitation; instead, they copied names and addresses they had purchased or collected months or years earlier through unrelated lead-generation efforts, and passed it off as information submitted by consumers who had agreed to join the broadband industry\u2019s campaign.\u201dThe AG has not found any evidence that the companies who hired the lead generators were aware that the companies didn\u2019t carry out a legitimate solicitation campaign, however.Three of the lead-generation companies engaged in this activity \u2013 Fluent, React2Media, and Opt-Intelligence \u2013 already have entered into settlements with the New York AG\u2019s office that require them to pay more than $4 million in total.In terms of the fake comments in support of net neutrality, the FCC lacked safeguards to detect or prevent millions of submissions from a single source, which is how one person managed to submit nearly 8 million comments, according to the report. A college student pursuing a degree in computer science in California was behind this particular campaign, using disposable email addresses to submit the comments one by one.\u201cAs this report makes clear, deception and fraud have infected public policymaking by agencies and legislatures, drowning out citizens\u2019 voices with manufactured and fraudulent public comments, letter, and petitions,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cReform is badly needed.\u201dJoin Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d \u2013 a LIVE roundtable event on\u00a0Wed, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "Despite an explosion in the sheer amount of stolen data available on the Dark Web, the value of personal information is holding steady, according to the 2021 Dark Web price index from Privacy Affairs.That leaves these thriving dirty data dealers in a familiar predicament \u2014 they need to lock down their growing businesses for added privacy and security.\u201cAs predicted, there is much more volume being sold now compared to last year, with fake-ID and credit-card vendors reporting sales in the several thousands,\u201d the report said. \u201cNot only quantity, but the variety of items to purchase has grown as well, such as hacked crypto accounts and web services like Uber accounts.\u201dBrandon Hoffman with Netenrich explained to Threatpost that he expects these Dark Web marketplaces to continue to look more like their legit counterparts.\u201cThe parallels between Dark Web markets and standard consumer markets continue to grow,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cAs can be seen in this report the market on the Dark Web is starting to follow standard economics. If there is a huge influx in inventory, the price goes down as long as demand remains somewhat steady. If there is a set of inventory with strong demand but the product is deemed to be of higher quality there is premium on that product.\u201dA private database of 122,000 U.S. dentists will run about $50 on the Dark Web, while credit card details for an account with a balance up to $5,000 costs about $240, according to the report, which scoured hundreds of vendors selling stolen data.What is Stolen Data Worth?While the going rate for some types of data, like PayPal credentials, have dropped because they have become so common, the value of cloned credit cards and personal information about the cardholder shot up, the report found.An example of stolen data listings online. Click to enlarge. Source: Privacy Affairs.\u201cThe price increase is most likely due to a combination of factors, like the increasing risks of attaining the information, the increasing benefit for buyers to use the information, the increased quality/accuracy of the card data, or just good ol\u2019 inflation,\u201d The report said.Last year, the price of a cloned Mastercard with PIN was about $15, the report said. This year, it\u2019s $25, with comparable rise in rates across cloned credit cards. Hacked cards from the U.S. with CVV data included are the cheapest, at around $17, because there\u2019s a high supply. Israeli cards are the most valuable, fetching $65 each.The rise in this area of the business has inspired vendors to adopt more traditional sales techniques, like an 80 percent guarantee on the stolen data, meaning only two out of every 10 cards will either fail or have less than the expected available balance, the report explained.Hacked Crypto Accounts Bring Big Bucks The rise of cryptocurrency has made hacked crypto accounts hugely valuable in these Dark Web marketplaces, the report said. \u201cDue to the skyrocketing prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, hacked accounts may hold large sums of coin-based currency and cash, protected by relaxed security measures after the initial verification process.\u201dThe average price for a hacked Coinbase-verified account is $610, the Dark Web Price Index said.Social-media credentials lost value over the past year, thanks in large part to the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA), forcing potential threat actors to use time-consuming social-engineering tactics instead, the report found.Services like video streaming, Uber and even FedEx accounts are up for sale in these marketplaces too. You can score a hacked Uber driver account for $14 or a one-year Netflix account for $44.Physical forged documents are by far the most valuable, followed by document scans and even counterfeit money, which is popular on these Dark Web marketplaces, some of which are sold with a guarantee to pass the UV pen test used at many retailers, the report said. The most valuable forged document according to the Dark Web Pricing index was a Maltese passport, which costs about $6,500.\u00a0Malware and DDoS Attacks Researchers also looked at malware and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for sale on the Dark Web.\u201cThis increase in ransomware attacks are not only from criminal organizations; those with limited resources and technical abilities can also initiate less sophisticated ransomware attacks that can prove quite lucrative,\u201d Kristina Balaam with Lookout explained to Threatpost by email. \u201cNow, we have more individuals attempting to compromise users. They rely on the Dark Web to purchase the products that allow them to accomplish this.\u201dThe added that demand, along with the rise in ransomware payments, is contributing to its price, Balaam added.\u201cWith an increasing demand in malware products, malware authors can increase their unit prices and cybercriminals hoping to take advantage of our new online lifestyles are willing to pay,\u201d Balaam said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing this reflected in the increasing malware prices in this report.\u201dDark Web Marketplaces Need Security With the volume and value of stolen data growing by leaps and bounds, it was only a matter of time before everyone else caught on, including the cops and other cybercriminals.\u201cIn an effort to mitigate detection and tracking by law enforcement, the Dark Web is moving towards increased security on all ends,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe markets have abandoned Bitcoin (BTC) as it is not secure, and vendors are demanding buyers to use Monero as payment and communicate only through PGP encryption.\u201d Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption system dating to 1991 that\u2019s used for both sending encrypted emails and encrypting sensitive files.This year marks a real milestone in these marketplaces coming of age, Austin Merritt, an analyst with Digital Shadows, told Threatpost.\u201cThis past year has been an incredibly unique time for Dark Web marketplaces, since overall supply and demand have increased with novel cybercriminal opportunities made possible by the chaos of COVID-19,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cOutside of market conditions, law-enforcement seizures of marketplaces, forum closures and increased competition among sellers have also added to the unpredictable nature of the landscape.\u201dEnd users are likewise encouraged to harden their security stance against cybercriminals with smart security like anti-malware tools, password hygiene and being aware of skimmers. But Privacy Affairs stressed that understanding the value of the personal data people use every day might help them think twice about their everyday practices.\u201cSince most of us do not spend our time shopping in these marketplaces, the most important takeaway from this research is an insight into how valuable personal data can be,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cIt also serves as a reminder for individuals to adopt multi-factor authentication when available, monitor account activity, and critically evaluate inbound emails, texts and phone calls from suspicious sources.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:March 24:\u00a0Economics of 0-Day Disclosures: The Good, Bad and Ugly (Learn more and register!)April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)BreachHacksMalwarePrivacyVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The Clop ransomware group has reportedly started posting data on the Dark Web apparently stolen from law firm Jones Day, which represents many of the globe\u2019s most powerful people, including former president Donald Trump in his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.But the attack had nothing to do with politics, a person claiming to be from the hacker group told Vice. Asked about the motivation, they responded, \u201cAnd what do you think? \ud83d\ude09 financial of course.\u201dThe site DataBreached.net was first to report on the incident and published screenshots of stolen Jones Day files that the Clop group posted on the Dark Web as proof it has the goods. The group told DataBreaches.net it didn\u2019t encrypt the files, just stole copies of information. The Clop crew also said Jones Day hasn\u2019t responded to its requests.\u201cHi, they ignore us so they will be published,\u201d DataBreaches.net reported that the group responded.A purported Clop ransomware hacker told the Wall Street Journal that Jones Day was notified on Feb. 3 that the data had been stolen and, as of Tuesday, Clop had not heard from the firm or discussed any ransom payment.Jones Day hasn\u2019t responded to Threatpost\u2019s request for comment.Accellion FTA BreachThe ransomware group claims it stole the information directly from Jones Day servers, but the firm denied that to the Wall Street Journal, instead pointing to a widespread compromise of the FTA file-sharing service from Accellion that emerged last December as the point of attack.The Journal added that the law firm Goodwin Procter LLP was also compromised as a result of the Accellion breach. Several other multi-national companies which use the Accellion file transfer service have also been compromised, including Tier 1 telecom carrier Singtel and Australian telecom company Optus.Accellion reported that it became aware of a zero-day vulnerability in its 20-year-old system on Dec. 23, but once the company came under attack, a cascade of bugs ensued. But by February, company said the system was fully patched.\u201cAccellion is conducting a full assessment of the FTA data security incident with an industry-leading cybersecurity forensics firm,\u201d a statement from the company said in response to Threatpost\u2019s inquiry about the Jones Day breach. \u201cWe will share more information once this assessment is complete.\u00a0For their protection, we do not comment on specific customers. We are working with all impacted FTA clients to understand and mitigate any impact of this incident, and to migrate them to our modern kiteworks content firewall platform as soon as possible.\u201dThe Wall Street Journal reported that it reviewed Clop\u2019s stolen Jones Day files, which included, \u201cAccellion configuration files and logs with references to Jones Day email and web addresses,\u201d in addition to unrelated files ripped off from a California hospital in 2016.The Vulnerable Software Supply ChainBut, Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research at Tripwire, told Threatpost that it\u2019s possible the hackers have found another vulnerability.\u201cIf Jones Day releases the results of the investigation that is still ongoing, that should point to the cause,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cIt is possible that the attacker is current, and Jones Day has not found the root cause yet but that remains to be proven.\u201dNonetheless, Bailey added, this should serve as a warning for organizations to start taking a harder look at their software supply chains.\u201cThe old saying a chain is only as strong as its weakest link also holds true for today\u2019s extensive supply chains,\u201d Bailey said. If one of the products used by an organization is exploited, it opens up the organization to breaches as well.\u201dBailey recommends using proactive threat intelligence services to detect and mitigate threats quickly.\u201cWhen an alert is received quickly, assess if \u00a0the vulnerable versions of the hardware or software are in use and take remediation actions,\u201d Bailey explained. \u201cIf a supplier was breached, assess what access the supplier had in the network and what data was accessible and then take actions to lock it down until remediations are in place.\u201dMore Accellion Breach Victims Likely\u00a0 Niamh Muldoon, global data protection officer at OneLogin ,said this probably won\u2019t be the last of the fallout from the Accellion breach.\u201cWe are likely to see more breach disclosures originating from the Accellion file-sharing data breach over the forthcoming months,\u201d Muldoon said.It\u2019s critical, Muldoon explained, for companies who fall victim to the compromise to engage in transparent communications with partners and clients about potential risks.\u201cBusiness leaders can take appropriate action now to help maintain the trust with their customers, partners and employees,\u201d Muldoon added. \u201cThey can achieve this by carrying out due-diligence with their organization to understand if Accellion data file sharing tool is in use and/or was in use in the past. Being transparent with customers, partners and employees about this tool usage and potential exposure allows for appropriate actions to be taken.\u201dThreatpost WEBINAR:\u00a0\u00a0Save your spot for\u00a0\u201c15 Cybersecurity Gaffes SMBs Make,\u201d a\u00a0\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Feb. 24 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Cybercriminals count on you making these mistakes, but our experts will help you lock down your small- to mid-sized business like it was a Fortune 100.\u00a0Register NOW\u00a0for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar on Wed., Feb. 24.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cloud SecurityHacksVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals are vying for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access, stolen payment cards and DDoS-for-Hire services, based on a recent analysis of underground marketplace pricing.During the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals have profited with \u201cincreasingly advantageous positions to benefit from the disruption,\u201d said researchers \u2014 and this has also been reflected on underground markets, where new services like targeted ransomware and advanced SIM swapping are popping up.\u201cAs a result of COVID-19 and associated global trends, demand for malicious and illicit goods, services and data have reached new peak highs across dark web marketplaces (DWMs),\u201d said researchers in a Friday analysis. \u201cFlashpoint has also observed what can only be described as impressive, shrewd innovation throughout the cybercrime ecosystem.\u201dUpon a deep-dive investigation into the underground marketplace, researchers found that the pricing for stolen payment cards has soared in 2020; jumping from $14.64 in 2019 to $20.16 in 2020. Meanwhile, the price of payment card \u201cdumps\u201d has also inched up from $24.19 in 2019 to average $26.50 in 2020.Payment Card Costs SoarWhile payment cards are sourced from online transactions and include card number, expiration date and cardholder name; dumps are usually sourced from malware-infected or skimmer-infected point-of-sale (PoS) terminals, and include magnetic strip track data.Credit: FlashpointResearchers said that payment-card data pricing varies and is typically influenced by \u201cfreshness\u201d (i.e., how recently the data was sourced), country of origin, availability of track 1 and track 2 magnetic strip data and expiration date.\u00a0RDP Server Access in High DemandMicrosoft\u2019s proprietary Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), used to enable system admins to remotely connect to corporate machines, as well as for server updates, continues to be a cybercriminal favorite.Credit: FlashpointRDP listings continue to grow in popularity throughout the cybercriminal ecosystem, said researchers. A successful RDP attack is lucrative for cybercriminals as it would give them remote access to the target computer with the same permissions, and access to data and folders, that a legitimate user would have.On underground marketplaces in 2020, researchers found that RDP access pricing varies \u2013 global admin access costs $10, while hacked RDP costs $35.Researchers noted that 2020 listings for RDP server access are less specialized, and cater to a broader audience. This can include packages that typically provide multiple RDP access options in one bundle.\u201cThis can cover country-specific access, bank account or government ID information, among other options to execute or manage the access,\u201d they said.DDoS-For-HireMeanwhile, DDoS-for-hire pricing appears to be on the rise since 2017, said researchers.\u00a0DDoS-for-hire, known as \u201cbooter\u201d services, make it easy to carry out DDoS attacks, flooding targets with internet traffic to overwhelm a site or IP address and eventually knock it offline.While in 2017 researchers rarely saw standard DDoS-for-hire offerings exceed $27, in 2020 a 10-minute DDoS attack (60 Gbps) costs $45, while a four-hour DDoS attack (15 Gbps) averages $55. Meanwhile, a fully-managed DDoS attack costs $165. Researchers said, this price increase is likely due to several contributing factors.Credit: Flashpoint\u201cFirst, taking down bigger websites must be custom-crafted due to improvements in DDoS protection offerings and widespread use of content distribution networks (CDNs), which are beyond the skills of all but the most advanced bot herders,\u201d they said. \u201cHowever, there are still instances where threat actors can successfully target larger websites, such as the takedown of Wikipedia via a DDoS attack in September 2019.\u201dDDoS-for-hire services that charge hourly rates are also becoming increasingly popular, they said.\u201cWhile booters\u2026remain prevalent, the need for more hands-on support and customization make subscription service options more appealing to buyers,\u201d said researchers.Researchers also tracked listings for an array of other services. These include bank logs and routing numbers (ranging from $25 for a U.S. bank log with a $100 balance, to $55 for a U.S. bank log with a $4,000 balance). Researchers also looked at pricing for \u201cfullz,\u201d which are full packages of personal identifiable information (PII) on individuals, mainly used for identity-fraud schemes (ranging from $4 to $10, with Fullz including financial information being more expensive).Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "The Dark Web/Darknet continues to be an environment for bad actors to share stolen credentials and discuss successful attacks. In fact, in recent weeks, personal information from places ranging from education organizations to voter databases in the U.S. have been found exposed. Although there have been big takedowns of cybercrime groups online, cybercriminals evolve to avoid detection.But just as there\u2019s a lot of bad on the Dark Web, there is also good \u2013 mostly in the form of intel that can be used to help protect organizations from attacks.Because they are so focused on doing what\u2019s right, researchers often overlook additional rich sources of cyber-threat intelligence that attackers essentially hand out as they interact online. In other words: To defend as a good guy, you have to think like a bad guy. Getting into an attacker\u2019s head provides clues as to how and why they operate.Understanding the Darknet/Dark WebFor general purposes, the terms \u201cDark Web\u201d and \u201cDarknet\u201d are more or less interchangeable, but there are some nuanced differences. When people refer to the Dark Web, they\u2019re usually talking about hacker sites on the internet that you can access from a regular web browser. When people talk about Darknet, it means you need special software. The most common one is the Tor browser, but there are others as well.Diving into the Darkness\u00a0To gain insight into how hackers operate, it helps to explore their stomping grounds. A common data source for threat intelligence are attacker-run and torrent/onion forums, usually on the Darknet, where hackers often discuss, purchase and sell malware, ransomware and denial-of-service offerings.For obvious reasons, many of these forums require researchers to jump through a significant number of hoops to access\u00a0 them. Some forums require payment of some kind; others require people to vouch for you as a real hacker. And sometimes, you have to prove your worthiness by demonstrating your ability to code around a security problem or create malicious software.Most attackers on these forums aren\u2019t just motivated by monetary gain. They\u2019re also looking for some glory. They want to post and advertise their knowledge in forums that will have the most views, and many want to show off their skills. What they typically show off are frequent attacks targeting mass numbers of individuals and organizations rather than narrow, specific, targeted attacks. So, the techniques shared in these forums help defenders understand attacker culture and how to defend against frequent attacks.Current TrendsAttack forums enable researchers to understand what attackers find interesting. Getting inside the mind of an attacker not only enables threat researchers to anticipate risks and the steps within an attack, but it also helps us to begin to profile certain cybercriminals. Threat behaviors are a lot like fingerprints and can be very useful in uncovering and defending against certain threats.One trend in these attack forums that has been popular and churned up a lot of discussion over the past few months is security on various web meeting platforms. Most these discussions have no malicious intent and are probably people just wanting to understand or discuss a specific topic. In some rare cases, however, it is clear that when an application is getting enough chatter, it is because attackers are starting to research vulnerabilities or test code.Threat researchers also make use of text dumps that contain usernames, names, passwords and other information. This is often what happens to data when cybercriminals, or even people in your organization, have intentionally or inadvertently leaked passwords or other personally identifiable information (PII). This data, of course, can put your entire organization at risk. At the very least, organizations should be checking to see if they\u2019ve been caught up in these types of credential packages and data leaks.Re-Stacking the OddsCyberattackers are notoriously opportunistic, and they also like to brag about their conquests. As threat researchers work hard to stay ahead of their adversaries, they often overlook key information within the Dark Web and Darknet that could help them. Examining hacker forums and text dumps are just two of the ways that researchers can glean valuable information that will help them protect the networks they are responsible for. For this reason, cybersecurity training for researchers needs to include methods of accessing the dark online world so the good guys can better understand how the bad guys operate and beat them at their own game.Another key part of this ecosystem is the role of law enforcement. Threat researchers can and should work with law-enforcement agencies to share threat information in a way that\u2019s easy and accessible. This has to be a two-way street. Tackling cybercrime can\u2019t be resolved unilaterally by law enforcement alone; it\u2019s a joint responsibility that requires trusted relationships to be fostered between the public and private sector.Aamir Lakhani is a cybersecurity researcher and practitioner for Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider community by\u00a0visiting past contributions.BreachCloud SecurityCritical InfrastructureHacksInfoSec InsiderMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The company behind the wildly popular kids\u2019 game Animal Jam has announced that hackers stole a menagerie of account records during a breach of a third-party vendor\u2019s server in October \u2014 more than 46 million of them, in fact.The company, WildWorks, said that it was unaware that the data had been compromised, until 7 million records turned up on an underground forum used by malicious actors to distribute lifted data, on Nov. 11.First released in 2010, the game is geared for 7- to 11-year-olds and marketed to parents as a safe and educational virtual space to explore the natural world.\u00a0The game is free to play and provides a virtual experience where kids can design their own animal avatars, learn facts about nature, chat with other players and engage in mini-competitions for in-game prizes. More than 300 million Animal Jam avatars have been created to date, and there are players across 225 countries, the company reported.The Animal Jam CompromiseHackers were able to obtain a key to a server database maintained by a third-party vendor that WildWorks uses for intra-company communication, according to the company. It did not name the vendor.\u201cWe believe our vendor\u2019s server was compromised some time between Oct. 10 and 12,\u201d the company said in a statement announcing the breach. \u201cIt was not apparent at the time that a database of account names was accessed as a result of the break-in, and all relevant systems were altered and secured against further intrusion. WildWorks learned of the database theft\u2026Nov. 11, 2020, when security researchers monitoring a public hacker forum saw the data posted there and alerted us.\u201dIn keeping with its safety- and privacy-conscious brand, WildWorks has taken a decidedly transparent approach with its users in the wake of the breach, launching an FAQ site detailing precisely what was stolen, directing users to update their passwords and offering assistance to affected customers.Please see this statement from WildWorks.More information and the FAQ can be found here: https://t.co/3llgkh27Cs pic.twitter.com/eqIPvXmDAe\u2014 WildWorks (@playwildworks) November 12, 2020According to its own reporting, the company said that cybercriminals were able to steal 7 million parent account email addresses, and 32 million usernames associated with the parent accounts, containing encrypted passwords, players\u2019 birthdays and gender, and more.\u201cNo real names of children were part of this breach,\u201d the company\u2019s site explained. \u201cBilling name and billing address were included in 0.02 percent of the stolen records; otherwise no billing information was stolen, nor information that could potentially identify parents of players. All Animal Jam usernames are human-moderated to ensure they do not include a child\u2019s real name or other personally identifying information.\u201dRegardless of the perceived exposure, Boris Cipot, senior sales engineer with Synopsys warned users to update their passwords immediately.\u201cOne way the cybercriminals may abuse this data is to carry out a phishing attack,\u201d Cipot said via email. \u201cTherefore, users, or their parents, need to watch out for any emails asking for personal information. It is important that the account password is changed immediately as well to avoid an account takeover. Passwords should also be changed across any other service where it might have been reused. The attackers might cross-reference your account information on other services in order to find other exploitable services. \u201dJavvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, meanwhile noted in a statement provided to Threatpost that parents and the broader industry should take a closer look at security risks associated with kids games and toys, once considered low-stakes in terms of threat exposure.Keeping Connected Toys and Games Safe \u201cIt raises the question as to how deeply embedded technology has become in all aspects of our lives, where even children\u2019s toys and games need accounts to be setup which potentially can hold sensitive information \u2014 and make an attractive target to attackers,\u201d Malik said by email.He suggested that a closer partnership between manufacturing and technology could help mitigate risks to kids and their data.\u201cNot just in products, but create [to] a culture of security that pushes good security practices to the forefront,\u201d Malik added. \u201cWhile no one approach will be able to prevent all breaches, it\u2019s important that data isn\u2019t collected unless necessary, and the data that is collected, is done for legitimate purposes and secured properly.\u201dGaming, Under Fire From Cybercriminals The gaming industry overall has become an increasingly attractive target for attacks. In late October the game \u201cAmong Us\u201d was hacked and rendered nearly unplayable for many, by what appeared to be a single malicious actor who got a thrill out of ruining the game for others.Just a week earlier, a ransomware gang claimed to have accessed the source code for Watch Dogs: Legion, ahead of its release. And, another title called Albion was similarly compromised and game databases released on underground forums.The Ragnar Locker ransomware gang was able to gain access to 1 terabyte of sensitive data on the network of gaming giant Capcom, the company behind titles including Resident Evil, Street Fighter and others.And just this week, popular kids\u2019 games Minecraft and Roblox uncovered a scam to rip off unsuspecting players\u2019 Google Play accounts.Cipot added that gaming breaches like these are continuing to gain value among scammers.\u201cThe gaming industry is a common target for attacks, be it data theft or ransomware attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cAn interesting observation within the gaming industry is that player accounts are often high-value assets due to in-app purchases, or rewards from leveling up. In other words, gaming accounts are often seen as items for sale \u2014 at least accounts owned by adults spending money. However, we now have proof that even educational games for children are no longer safe, and are valuable resources for bad actors.\u201dWhile WildWorks grapples with the fallout from the compromise, Malik added that its communications strategy should be a model for other companies.\u201cIt\u2019s reassuring to see Animal Jam take a proactive stance in investigating the breach and being transparent in their approach,\u201d he said.Hackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "UPDATEPersonal information for several million American voters has turned up on a Russian underground cybercrime forum, according to reports \u2013 and users are purportedly looking to monetize it using a recently launched State Department program meant to prevent election-meddling.The personal information includes names, dates of birth, gender, physical addresses and email addresses, and election-specific data \u2013 such as when an individual registered to vote, voter registration numbers and polling stations \u2013 according to Kommersant, a Moscow-based newspaper.The outlet reported Tuesday that several databases of voter data (including one encompassing 7.6 million voters in Michigan, and others covering between 2 million and 6 million voters each for Arkansas, Connecticut, Florida and North Carolina) turned up in an unnamed marketplace in late 2019. Now, that information is being offered for free in discussion forums by someone going by the handle Gorka9, according to Kommersant. The publication added that the hacker said the data was still valid as of this past March.Security firm Infowatch confirmed that the databases seem authentic. A spokesperson for Infowatch said that the information could be used to mount influence campaigns bent on swaying U.S. voters towards one candidate or another \u2014 but more likely, it could be used to mount convincing phishing efforts.\u201cAs is usual in cases like these, victims (registered voters) will need to be on the lookout for bad actors attempting to use the information gleaned from these databases to obtain even more information about their targets,\u201d Chris Hauk, consumer privacy champion at Pixel Privacy, told Threatpost via email. \u201cIt is sad to believe that in this day and age that simply registering to exercise your right to vote can make you the target of hackers.\u201dMeanwhile, forum users told Kommersant that they have also been able to monetize the data through the U.S. State Department\u2019s $10 million anti-influence program. The Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program, which is administered by the Diplomatic Security Service, is offering millions in rewards for \u201cinformation leading to the identification or location of any person who works with or for a foreign government for the purpose of interfering with U.S. elections through certain illegal cyber-activities.\u201dOne person told Kommersant that he was paid $4,000 through the program for alerting the Feds about a leaked Connecticut voter database \u2013 a claim that has not been confirmed. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.As for how the data was obtained, one hacker told the outlet that most of the theft is carried out using server vulnerabilities that can be exploited via SQL injection, which is a method for inserting malicious code into a vulnerable, targeted database. Security researchers said that the claim is entirely plausible.\u201cNew vulnerabilities are reported every hour and database systems are especially prone to attack due to their highly configurable and powerful interactive features,\u201d Mark Kedgley, CTO at New Net Technologies (NNT), told Threatpost. \u201cSQL injection is still a difficult vulnerability to test for as automated tests usually lack the knowledge of the application\u2019s setup and operation. Encryption of data is always an unpopular route due to the heavy impact on system resources and performance. Ideally, security needs to be built in as the application is developed and then a hardened configuration applied to the database system, derived from either the CIS Benchmark or DISA STIG.\u201dHowever, in some cases, hacking may not even be required in order to garner the information, according to Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkably easy to get one\u2019s hands on voter databases in most states,\u201d Bischoff said via email. \u201cMany of them are available to the public, including Michigan. Even though there are rules about how the data can be used, rules can be broken. Those who legitimately request receive voter data are responsible for securing it, and not everyone has the same standards of security. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see more voter databases in the hands of foreign threat actors before the 2020 general election.\u201dAnd indeed, following Kommersant\u2019s report, the Michigan Secretary of State\u2019s office emphasized that the data the forum users say they have on offer is public information that was likely simply recompiled.\u201cOur system has not been hacked,\u201d according to a press statement from the Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson\u2019s office. \u201cPublic voter information in Michigan and elsewhere is accessible to anyone through a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request,\u201d Benson\u2019s office said.As a backdrop, election-meddling continues to be a security concern as the U.S. presidential election looms on the horizon. While direct hacking activity remains a concern, experts say that the bigger issue is influence campaigns bent on spreading divisiveness and disinformation \u2014 mainly through online social-media bots and troll farms.\u00a0In fact, a recent Black Hat attendee survey, more than 70 percent said influence campaigns will have the greatest impact on the elections.UPDATE: This article was updated at 10 a.m. ET on Sept. 2 to include the statement from the Michigan Secretary of State.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.BreachCloud SecurityGovernmentPrivacyVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have found 142 million personal details from former guests at the MGM Resorts hotels for sale on the Dark Web, evidence that a data leak from the hotel chain last summer may be far bigger in scope than previously thought.An advertisement on a hacker forum has put 142,479,937 details from \u201cMGM Grand Hotels\u201d guests up for sale for more than $2,900, according to a published report on ZDNet.In the ad, the hacker makes a connection between the newly advertised credentials and a previously known leak of personal details of more than 10.6 million guests who had stayed at MGM Resorts. That breach, news of which surfaced in February, was attributed to unauthorized access to a misconfigured cloud server that occurred at the hotel chain last summer.\u201cHowever, what was not reported was that MGM Grand Hotels was also breached, consisting of 142 million entries,\u201d according to the underground forum ad.MGM Resorts International is the parent company for the MGM Grand as well as some of the most iconic and well-known resorts in Las Vegas, including the Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, the Mirage and Luxor.As there is no \u201cMGM Grand Hotels\u201d in the chain\u2014merely the MGM Grand and the parent company MGM Resorts \u2014 it\u2019s not entirely clear which properties specifically contributed the 142 million credentials being sold online. However, given the number of credentials offered, it seems fairly safe to assume they are from guests at hotels across the resort chain.The latest cache of 142 million MGM details are the result of a breach of DataViper, a data leak monitoring service operated by Night Lion Security, the hacker claimed in the ad. According to an investigation from Brian Krebs, Data Viper \u201cprovides access to some 15 billion usernames, passwords and other information exposed in more than 8,000 website breaches.\u201d Hackers claim to have posted its databases online, which include a full 2 billion records collected from other companies during past security breaches.However, ZDNet in a\u00a0separate report Monday also claimed to have spoken with Vinny Troia, founder of Night Lion, who said his company never owned a copy of the full MGM database, suggesting that the 142 million credentials could not have come from that breach.It\u2019s also unclear if the 10.6 million credentials from MGM Resorts posted to a hacking forum earlier this year is included in the database of 142 million currently up for sale, or if they are two separate data stores. The smaller database included personal information \u2014 such as full names, home addresses, phone numbers, emails and dates of birth \u2014 from celebrities, tech CEOs, reporters, government officials, and employees at some of the world\u2019s largest tech companies. Among the famous names cited in reports of the link were Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and pop music star Justin Bieber. The database also had details for officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Safety Authority, according to reports.MGM Resorts already has acknowledged that there was indeed a data breach at its organization, though it did not publicize the incident nor has said how many credentials were breached.However, the company did say it notified affected clients about the breach, something that appeared to be true according to a comment made on a site called VegasMessageBoard in August 2019. A community member posted on the site and said he\u2019d been notified that his data had been stolen at MGM Resorts a month earlier, in July.There is evidence that the breach could have affected up to 200 million MGM clients, according to Tuesday\u2019s ZDNet report, which cited posts on Russian-speaking hacking forums promoting the sale of even more MGM credentials.BreachCloud SecurityHacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have identified a credit-card skimming campaign that\u2019s been active since mid-April that has a rather specific and unusual target: ASP.NET-based websites running on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers.New research from Malwarebytes Labs recently uncovered the campaign, which already has compromised at least a dozen websites that range from sports organizations, health and community associations, and a credit union \u2014 all via a malicious code injected into existing JavaScript libraries on each of the sites.The campaign seems to be exploiting an older version of ASP.NET, version 4.0.30319, which is no longer officially supported and contains multiple vulnerabilities, according to the report by Malwarebytes director of threat research Jerome Segura.\u201cThis skimming campaign likely began sometime in April 2020 as the first domain (hivnd[.]net) part of its infrastructure (31.220.60[.]108) was registered on April 10 by a threat actor using a ProtonMail email address,\u201d he wrote in the report.In most cases, attackers were seen injecting the skimming code directly into the compromised JavaScript library of the affected site, though in some cases it was loaded remotely, he said in the report. In the latter instance, attackers loaded the skimmer from the remote domain thxrq[.]com.Credit-card skimmers do basically what their name suggests\u2014they read and record credit-card details from otherwise legitimate transactions for use by threat actors. The actors behind these campaigns typically will put up these details bundled together for sale on dark-web forums.Point-of-sale transactions\u2014such as those at gas-station pumps \u2014 are a key target for these type of attacks, but basically any web-based commerce transaction in which someone uses a credit card to pay is vulnerable.Indeed, as this type of scam has been around for some time, security researchers tend to look for it among its typical targets, such as e-commerce content management systems (CMS), such as Magento, and plugins like WooCommerce, Segura wrote.\u201cAs defenders, we tend to focus a lot of our attention on the same platforms, in large part because most of the compromised websites we flag are built on the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) stack,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not because those technologies are less secure, but simply because they are so widely adopted.\u201dWhile ASP.NET is not as popular as PHP, it\u2019s still used among smaller businesses and personal blogs, including many sites that run shopping-cart applications, accounting for \u201ca sizeable market share,\u201d Segura said. It\u2019s those shopping portals that attackers specifically targeted in the campaign, showing that any website that can be \u201csubverted without too much effort is fair game,\u201d he said.\u201cIn some cases, we notice \u2018accidental\u2019 compromises, where some sites get hacked and injected even though they weren\u2019t really the intended victims,\u201d Segura wrote.In the bulk of the new attacks observed, threat actors used several different styles to look for not only credit-card data but also passwords, although the latter functionality was incorrectly implemented, Segura said. The change-up in style made the campaign difficult for researchers to pinpoint at first, he said.Once researchers identified the campaign and affected sites, they contacted the affected parties \u201cin the hope that they would identify the breach and take appropriate actions to harden their infrastructure,\u201d Segura said.BEC and enterprise email fraud is surging, but DMARC can help \u2013 if it\u2019s done right.

        "raw text": "A hack-for-hire group, called Dark Basin, has been outed after targeting thousands of individuals and organizations worldwide \u2013 including advocacy groups and journalists, elected and senior government officials, and hedge funds \u2014 over the course of seven years.Dark Basin conducted commercial espionage on behalf of their clients, against customers\u2019 opponents involved in high-profile public events, criminal cases, financial transactions, news stories and advocacy, according to researchers at Citizen Lab. In all, more than 10,000 victim email accounts were targeted, according to Reuters, who broke the news.\u201cCitizen Lab has notified hundreds of targeted individuals and institutions and, where possible, provided them with assistance in tracking and identifying the campaign,\u201d according to a report on Dark Basin released by Citizen Lab researchers\u00a0on Tuesday. \u201cAt the request of several targets, Citizen Lab shared information about their targeting with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). We are in the process of notifying additional targets.\u201dCitizen Lab first discovered the group in 2017 after it was contacted by a journalist who had been targeted with phishing attempts. The phishing was linked to a custom URL shortener, which was tied to a larger network of almost 28,000 URL shorteners containing the email addresses of targets and operated by Dark Basin.Tactics, Techniques and ProceduresThe group sent highly targeted phishing emails to its targets from a range of email accounts, including Gmail accounts and self-hosted accounts. The use of URL shorteners for masking phishing sites is a staple for the group \u2013 researchers said that over 16 months, they observed 28 unique URL shortener services that were operated by Dark Basin.These malicious links led to phishing sites, designed to look identical to popular online web services such as Google Mail, Yahoo Mail, Facebook and others. These landing pages then stole the credentials of victims.\u201cSophistication of the bait content, specificity to the target, message volume and persistence across time varied widely between clusters,\u201d researchers said. \u201cIt appears that Dark Basin\u2019s customers may receive varying qualities of service and personal attention, possibly based on payment, or relationships with specific intermediaries.\u201d\u00a0Widespread TargetingResearchers tied the group to years of attacks against various targets. That includes at least two American advocacy groups who were requesting that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) preserve net-neutrality rules in the U.S. (in a campaign previously uncovered by the EFF); U.S. non-governmental organizations Fight for the Future\u00a0and\u00a0Free Press; and journalists from multiple major U.S. media outlets.For instance, the group targeted campaigners involved with #ExxonKnew, which is a campaign that claims that ExxonMobil hid information about climate change for decades. That included targeting #ExxonKnew campaigners\u2019 family members with phishing emails \u2013 in at least one case a target\u2019s minor child was among those targeted.Phishing bait from Dark Basin. Click to enlarge.As part of their investigation, researchers linked the phishing attacks with highly targeted emails, purporting to come from other campaigners or from legal counsel involved in litigation against ExxonMobil, that referenced targets\u2019 work on ExxonMobil and climate change. In other cases, Dark Basin sent emails with fake Google News updates involving ExxonMobil. The emails would then contain a malicious URL that brought victims to the landing page.In 2016, a private #ExxonMobil email inviting campaigners to a January 2016 meeting was \u00a0leaked by unknown parties to two newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal.\u201cThe leak of the January 2016 email, as well as suspicious emails noticed by campaigners, led some present at the meeting to suspect their private communications may have been compromised,\u201d said researchers. \u201cWe later determined that all but two recipients of the leaked January email were also Dark Basin targets.\u201dBellTroX InfoTech ServicesResearchers also associated Dark Basin to BellTroX InfoTech Services, an India-based technology company, with \u201chigh confidence.\u201d Threatpost has reached out to BellTroX InfoTech Services for comment but had not heard back by publication time.BellTroX InfoTech home page. Click to enlarge.\u201cWe are an independent firm of transcriptionists, designers, developers, engineers, consultants and technical specialists offering a broad range of professional services. Through our work, we make a positive difference in the world,\u201d according to BellTroX\u2019s website.Several clues led researchers to link Dark Basin to the company. Initially, researchers found that timestamps in the phishing emails were consistent with the working hours in India\u2019s UTC+5:30 time zone. Several of Dark Basin\u2019s URL shortening services also had names associated with India (Holi, Rongali and Pochanchi, for example).Then, upon further investigation, they were able to identify several \u00a0BellTroX employees whose activities overlapped with Dark Basin because they used personal documents, including a C.V. (resume), as bait content when testing their URL shorteners.The employees also put up social-media posts taking credit for attack techniques, which contained screenshots of links to Dark Basin infrastructure, researchers said. The company\u2019s \u201cstaff activities\u201d listed on LinkedIn include email penetration, exploitation, corporate espionage and more.\u201cBellTroX and its employees appear to use euphemisms for promoting their services online, including \u2018Ethical Hacking\u2019 and \u2018Certified Ethical Hacker,'\u201d they said. \u201cBellTroX\u2019s slogan is: \u2018you desire, we do!'\u201dAs of Sunday (June 7) BellTroX\u2019s website began serving an error message. Researchers said that since then, postings and other materials linking BellTroX to these operations have been recently deleted.Hack-for-HireResearchers said that they believe that in at least one case, Dark Basin repurposed a stolen internal email to re-target other individuals \u2013 leading them to conclude that Dark Basin had \u201csome success\u201d in gaining access to the email accounts of one or more advocacy groups.Researchers said that the utilization of hack-for-hire firms may be fueled by an increasing normalization of commercialized cyber-offensive activity, including surveillance and \u201chacking back.\u201d Recently for instance, researchers with Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) warned that they\u2019ve spotted a spike in activity from several India-based firms that have been creating Gmail accounts that spoof the World Health Organization (WHO) to send coronavirus-themed phishing emails.\u201cDark Basin\u2019s activities make it clear that there is a large and likely growing hack-for-hire industry,\u201d Citizen Lab researchers\u00a0said. \u201cHack-for-hire groups enable companies to outsource activities like those described in this report, which muddies the waters and can hamper legal investigations.\u201dPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A database containing credentials from more than 26 million LiveJournal accounts has been leaked online and is being sold on the Dark Web and hacker forums.The data contained in the files appears to be from a 2014 incident in which 33 million accounts were hacked, according to a published report. Though rumors of that breach have been in circulation for a couple of years \u2013 and there is some debate over when it actually occurred \u2013 the incident was never officially confirmed by LiveJournal, sources said.Hackers, however, seem to have been busy using and selling data from the breach to mount attacks, ultimately sharing it with Troy Hunt from Have I Been Pwned. The data-breach notification service added a listing about the LiveJournal leak on Tuesday, citing mid-2019 as the time news of the breach surfaced.The listing categorizes the breach as having occurred in January 2017, compromising 26,372,781 user accounts; the hackers stole email addresses, passwords and user names for members of the blogging service. A source who requested that the info be attributed to nano@databases[dot]pw turned the info over to Hunt, according to the listing.\u201cAn archive of the data was subsequently shared on a popular hacking forum in May 2020 and redistributed broadly,\u201d according to the listing.Still, other evidence points to the breach happening sooner, according to another report. A now-defunct data-leak tracking service, We Leak Info, tweeted in July 2019 about a 2014 leak of 33 million LiveJournal accounts.No matter the timeline, it does seem that LiveJournal was compromised and user information has been in the hands of bad actors for some time, who already have acted on that information with various types of attacks, ranging from the credential stuffing to email-based extortion, according to various sources.The Have I Been Pawned listing cites \u201cmultiple reports of credential abuse\u201d against a company called Dreamwidth, a spinoff of LiveJournal based on its original code base with a significant number of crossover users.While Dreamwidth never confirmed the attacks, a Twitter user called \u201cdefinitely not a huge award-winning fanfic author\u201d who claims to be a co-founder of the site tweeted in response to Hunt on Tuesday that the site has definitely seen an uptick in credential-stuffing attacks.The tweet seems to be backed up by a blog post from Dreamwidth co-founder and former LiveJournal staffer Mark Smith from April, which informs users of an update to the site\u2019s authentication mechanism from outdated and insecure LiveJournal protocols to more secure web infrastructure.\u201cWe are making some changes to how we do authentication (how you log in) that will unfortunately break a number of older clients that you might be using to talk to Dreamwidth,\u201d he wrote, \u201cThis is very unfortunate, but we think that the tradeoffs in improved security are very much worth it.\u201dThe post stops short, however, at acknowledging that any attacks were occurring based on data leaked from a LiveJournal breach.\u201cWe do not believe, and have no evidence of, our database ever being leaked or accessed other than by the three staff members who maintain Dreamwidth\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cWe are making these changes not because of some extrinsic motivation but because we believe that they\u2019re the right thing to do.\u201dMeanwhile, there is earlier evidence from a couple of years ago that shows threat attackers using LiveJournal data for other scams.A Twitter user who responded to a tweet by Hunt in 2018 \u2013 when rumors were circulating about a potential unconfirmed LiveJournal breach\u2013said that hackers tried to extort money from him based on acquiring data from the breach. Freelance software engineer Alexander Mikhailian said his LiveJournal password was leaked and he received an extortion letter \u201casking to transfer $800 [in] bitcoins or else.\u201dConcerned about the IoT security challenges businesses face as more connected devices run our enterprises, drive our manufacturing lines, track and deliver healthcare to patients, and more?

        "raw text": "A new botnet has compromised hundreds of ASUS, D-Link and Dasan Zhone routers over the past three months, as well as Internet of Things (IoT) devices like video recorders and thermal cameras.The botnet, called dark_nexus (based on a string it prints in its banner), uses processes similar to previous dangerous IoT threats like the Qbot banking malware and Mirai botnet. However, dark_nexus also comes armed with an innovative module for enabling persistence and detection evasion, which researchers say \u201cputs other [botnets] to shame.\u201d\u201cWhile [dark_nexus] might share some features with previously known IoT botnets, the way some of its modules have been developed makes it significantly more potent and robust,\u201d researchers with Bitdefender said in a Wednesday analysis. \u201cFor example, payloads are compiled for 12 different CPU architectures and dynamically delivered based on the victim\u2019s configuration.\u201dThe discovery of dark_nexus comes as botnets continue to pose a formidable threat, compromising vulnerable internet-connected devices in order to peddle spam, distribute malware or flood systems with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.The BotnetDark_nexus uses Telnet credential stuffing (using a predefined credential list) and exploits to compromise devices, via two modules. Earlier versions of the botnet used exploits targeting flaws like the critical CVE-2019-7256, a command-injection vulnerability in Linear eMerge E3-Series, and an unauthenticated remote code-execution flaw in Netgear DGN1000 routers.Dark_nexus also borrows code and processes previously used by Qbot and the infamous Mirai botnet that launched the 2016 Dyn DDos attack. Its startup code for instance acts similarly to Qbot, blocking several signals and detaching itself from the terminal. And, similar to Mirai, dark_nexus binds to a fixed port (7630), ensuring that a single instance of the bot can run on the device.In another similarity to other botnets (TheMoon, Gwmndy and Omg botnet) researchers found socks5 proxies in some versions of dark_nexus, potentially used for renting access to the footprint.Since it was first spotted in December, researchers estimate (based on honeypot evidence) that the botnet has compromised at least 1,372 devices worldwide. These are mainly based in South Korea but also are hosted in China, Thailand and Brazil. In comparison, Mirai had infected more than 600,000 IoT devices during its peak in November 2016.New FeaturesBeyond these similarities, however, researchers point to the dark_nexus component lineup as a sign that the botnet it paving its own way. These modules are frequently updated, with 30 new versions found in three months.Dark_nexus comes with tactics enabling detection evasion and persistence. The botnet uses a technique for launching DDoS attacks that cloaks traffic as innocuous, browser-generated traffic, helping it bypass detection, for instance. Once it infects a device, the bot also attempts to disguise itself by pretending to be a BusyBox (under the name /bin/busybox), a popular software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file.Credit: BitdefenderDark_nexus also comes with commands for removing restart permissions on compromised devices, thus enabling persistence. The commands try to prevent the device from rebooting by stopping the cron service (which is used to schedule tasks) and removing permissions for executables that could be used to reboot the device.The botnet also uses a unique technique meant to ensure \u201csupremacy\u201d on the compromised device, researchers said: \u201cUniquely, dark_nexus uses a scoring system based on weights and thresholds to assess which processes might pose a risk,\u201d they said. \u201cThis involves maintaining a list of whitelisted process\u2026and killing every other process that that crosses a threshold of suspicion.\u201dOther features used by the botnet include a debugging module to maintain proper functionality and reliability of the device. And, the botnet\u2019s payload is customized for targeting 12 different CPU architectures \u2013 giving it more breadth in terms of the types and number of devices it can target.In terms of attribution, researchers point to greek.Helios, a known botnet author who sells DDoS services and botnet code, as a possible creator of dark_nexus. Early dark_nexus binaries contains a string \u201c@greek.helios\u201d in their banner that was present in other botnets (such as in a 2018 Mirai variant called \u201choho\u201d).\u201cUsing YouTube videos demoing some of his past work and posting offerings on various cybercriminal forums, greek.Helios seems to have experience with IoT malware skills, honing them to the point of developing the new dark_nexus botnet,\u201d said researchers.IoTMalware",

        "raw text": "A variant of the Mirai Internet of Things (IoT) botnet known as \u201cEchobot\u201d has added 13 more vulnerability exploits to its bag of infiltration tricks, according to researchers. These target a range of devices, including routers, firewalls, IP cameras, server management utilities, a programmable logic controller used in industrial environments, an online payment system and even a Yachtcontrol web application.The new additions range from old CVEs (one from 2006 is for Barracuda spam firewalls) to a bug that was disclosed just in early December. They bring the latest version of the malicious code to having a total of 71 unique exploits.IoT botnets are bent on infecting connected devices in order to marshal their resources to carry out various nefarious activities, such as carrying out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. As such, casting a wide net is a savvy strategy to scale the botnet.\u201cOne could risk a guess that the attackers could potentially be aiming for the sweet spots of IoT vulnerabilities, targeting either legacy devices that are still in use but probably too old to update due to compatibility issues and newer vulnerabilities that are too recent for owners to have patched,\u201d according to researchers at Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42 division, in a recent posting.One of the more unusual bugs includes CVE-2019-17270, a remote code execution flaw in the previously mentioned Yachtcontrol webservers, which allow yacht owners to remotely control the functions of their vessels.\u201cIt\u2019s possible to perform direct operating system commands as an unauthenticated user via the \u2018/pages/systemcall.php?command={COMMAND}\u2019 page and parameter, where {COMMAND} will be executed and returning the results to the client,\u201d according to the bug advisory.CCBill Online Payment Systems was also targeted in the new version; CCBill handles online e-commerce payments for around 30,000 e-tailers, according to its website.And, Echobot has added an exploit for a command-injection bug in the Citrix NetScaler SD-WAN product used by businesses to connect branch locations.The latest version appeared in October \u201cfor a couple of hours\u201d with 11 new bugs before it went back offline, according to Unit 42; then it resurfaced in early December with two additional exploits.\u201cThese vulnerabilities haven\u2019t been previously seen exploited in the wild prior to this version,\u201d according to the posting.Mirai variants continue\u00a0 to crop up; in October 2016,\u00a0Mirai malware spread itself to IoT devices\u00a0gaining access via default password and usernames. The malware then roped affected devices into a botnet and carried out DDoS attacks. The largest of such attacks flooded DNS provider Dyn causing several well-known websites to go dark for hours. Mirai\u2019s source code was subsequently leaked, leading to the rise of several other copycat botnets, including Echobot.Free Threatpost Webinar:\u00a0Risk around third-party vendors is real and can lead to data disasters.

        "raw text": "SmarterASP.NET, a popular web hosting provider with more than 440,480 customers, has been hit with a ransomware attack that took down its customers\u2019 websites that were hosted by the company. The company on Monday said it is in the process of recovering impacted data.SmarterASP.NET offers shared web hosting services \u2013 which allow many websites to reside on one web server connected to the internet \u2013 for customers. Many SmarterASP.NET customers specifically are looking to host ASP.NET sites. ASP.NET is an open source web framework, created by Microsoft, for building web apps and services with .NET.According to reports, the ransomware attack hit and encrypted customers\u2019 web hosting accounts \u2013\u00a0which give customers access to servers where they can store files and data required to run their websites \u2013\u00a0thus crippling customer websites. SmarterASP.NET\u2019s website was also initially downed by the attack, but has since been recovered.\u201cYour hosting account was under attack and hackers have encrypted all your data,\u201d according to a Monday notice on SmartASP\u2019s website. \u201cWe are now working with security experts to try to decrypt your data and also to make sure this would never happen again.\u00a0 Please stay tune for more info.\u201dWhile it\u2019s unclear when the ransomware attack first hit, a rash of Tweets, starting Nov. 9, show customers angered that they were not notified of the attack via email after their services stopped.The company is in the middle of recovering accounts that were locked down by the attack. According to a Monday morning update, 90 percent of the impacted accounts are \u201cback to normal\u201d after the company found \u201ca solution to resolve this problem.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether the solution stems from the company paying the ransom or restoring from backup files. Details also are currently scant around how the company was first attacked. Threatpost has reached out for further clarification.According to a ZDNet report, the customer files were encrypted by a version of the Snatch ransomware, which is known for being distributed via spam email containing infected attachments or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the operating system and installed software. Typically Snatch ransomware locks down victim data and asks for a ransom between $500 to $1500 in Bitcoin.SmarterASP.NET said on Monday morning it will need time to recover the remaining 10 percent of accounts, but it\u00a0expects most customers to be back online within 24 hours.\u201cFTP and Control panel should be back to normal in the next 30 minutes or so,\u201d according to the update.\u201cWhen you login and If you see weird extensions in your files, don\u2019t download them. Those are encrypted files and it\u2019s useless to download them. Please wait for our staff to fix it. We will continue to keep everyone posted.\u201dOther hosting services have also fallen victim to ransomware \u2013 in December 2018, Dataresolution.net was hit with a Christmas Eve attack. A2 Hosting in April 2019 reported a ransomware attack that had\u00a0encrypted their Windows hosting servers.Ransomware attacks in general\u00a0continue to make headlines. In June, dual Florida cities \u2013 Lake City and Riviera Beach \u2013 were both hit by ransomware attacks and decided to\u00a0pay off the hackers. And, after a rash of public schools were\u00a0hit with ransomware in July, Louisiana\u2019s governor declared a statewide state of emergency.\u201cUnfortunately, this continues a trend that we have noted of ransomware actors targeting service providers as way to gain access to their clients or encrypt client data correctly,\u201d security researcher Allan Lisa told Threatpost.\u201cAccording to one survey 12 percent of all ransomware attacks are the result of a compromised service provider. A similar attack happened in August with the ransomware attack on Digital Dental Records and famously in 2017 with South Korean hosting company, Nayana. As these targets continue to prove lucrative for attackers we expect this trend to continue. \u201dWhat are the top risks to modern enterprises in the peak era of data breaches?

        "raw text": "Joker\u2019s Stash, a Dark Web destination that specializes in trading in payment-card data, has added 1.3 million credit and debit cards to its inventory, belonging to Indian banking customers. Researchers said it\u2019s the largest stolen payment card cache ever put up for sale.According to Group-IB, the cybersecurity firm that found the listing, the data haul represents around $130 million given that each card record is being offered for $100. Joker\u2019s Stash is advertising it under the \u201cINDIA-MIX-NEW-01\u201d heading.Where the card data came from is unclear \u2013 Group-IB said in a media report that it was likely skimmed from compromised point-of-sale systems or ATMs. In its listing, Joker\u2019s Stash said that the stolen info includes both track 1 and track 2 data that\u2019s included on a card\u2019s magnetic strip (name, card number, expiry and potentially the CVV, plus addresses and other discretionary information used by the bank for fraud protection purposes).Anyone purchasing the information can create cloned cards to physically use at ATMs or at in-store machines that aren\u2019t chip-enabled; or, they can simply use the information to buy things online.The listing says the card data is 90 to 95 percent valid \u2013 and Group-IB said that researchers independently verified the information as consisting of real card details. About 18 percent of the records come from one particular Indian bank. Most (98 percent) of the cards are Indian but about 1 percent are from Columbian banks, according to the firm.The fact that all of the records were put up for sale at once is unusual, according to Ilya Sachkov, CEO and founder of Group-IB. Typically, card data dumps are rationed out to avoid attracting notice from white-hats. The decision to provide the data trove en masse indicates that the purveyors are looking to monetize the cards quickly, before consumers report them as compromised and banks start canceling them.\u201cThis is indeed the biggest card database encapsulated in a single file ever uploaded on underground markets at once,\u201d Sachkov told BankInfoSecurity. \u201cWhat is also interesting about this particular case is that the database that went on sale hadn\u2019t been promoted prior either in the news, on card shop or even on forums on the Dark Net. The cards from this region are very rare on underground markets. In the past 12 months, it is the only one big sale of card dumps related to Indian banks.\u201dJoker\u2019s Stash \u201cposes an evolving and enduring threat to consumers and retailers affected by fraudsters populating the market,\u201d according to research last week from Recorded Future. Its infrastructure consists of more than 500 domains and 54 servers; these are typically spun up and used for surges in available data to provide better support to clients that buy in bulk.\u201cRecorded Future assesses with high confidence that Joker\u2019s Stash will remain a popular marketplace for threat actors to advertise and sell compromised credit cards, as spikes in marketplace activities have coincided with major breaches,\u201d the firm noted.\u00a0What are the top mistakes leading to data breaches at modern enterprises?

        "raw text": "UPDATEA Dark Web \u201ccarding store\u201d called BriansClub, which specializes in selling stolen payment card information, has itself become a victim, with thieves making off with 26 million credit- and debit-card records. The site appears to be a target of roundabout \u201chacking back\u201d by a competitor , who shared the data with financial institutions in an effort to cut off any potential card fraud.The data set represents everything uploaded to BriansClub in the last four years, according to independent researcher Brian Krebs (ironically, the forum\u2019s namesake). Of those, 14 million of the payments cards are unexpired, Krebs said in a posting this week.The marketplace\u2019s wares come in the form of digital card information that could be encoded on a card with a magnetic strip in order to produce counterfeit payment cards. Its total inventory, according to the going black market rates analyzed by Flashpoint, is worth $414 million. However, Krebs also noted that BriansClub has only sold 9.1 million stolen cards in that time period (granted, still earning the site $126 million worth of Bitcoin).\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to note that Krebs thinks the supply of stolen cards for sale on BriansClub outstrips demand \u2013 there are literally more stolen credit cards up for sale than criminals know what to do with,\u201d Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech, said via email.Meanwhile researchers noted that the data that has been delivered to banks and card issuers provides invaluable intel for them.\u201cThis hack is a great reminder of the dollar amounts at risk for all stakeholders \u2013 consumers, credit card companies and banks \u2013 with credit card thefts, and the need to understand how to mitigate the potential financial loss,\u201d Jack Kudale, founder and CEO of Cowbell Cyber, told Threatpost. \u201cVisibility into Dark Web exposure can help financial services companies stay current on the actual level of cyber insurance coverage they need.\u201dAfter being contacted by Krebs, the BriansClub site administrator confirmed that the site\u2019s data center had been hacked.\u201cFrom a broader security perspective, the incident is classed as a breach, and while the data that was taken was obtained by criminal activity, legitimate businesses should take note,\u201d Jens Monrad, head of Intelligence of EMEA at FireEye, said via email. \u201cWhen we talk about the theft of data, it is important to differentiate from threats in the real world, where there is a chance of getting what was stolen back. In cyberspace, the value of data from a threat actor perspective will either be for financial gain, to fuel further attacks or cause havoc in the interest of foreign governments. The data will not be \u2018returned\u2019 so it becomes harder to anticipate future threats down the line. Therefore, it\u2019s important to detect and respond to a cyberattack quickly, so the consequences of critical or sensitive data theft do not ripple across the organization in weeks, months of years to come.\u201dIt\u2019s unknown who the perpetrators are in the re-stealing of the information, but the situation is sure to shake up the Dark Web landscape, according to Terence Jackson, CISO at Thycotic.\u201cThe immediate impact will be a positive one for consumers since the data has been shared with the proper entities that can reissue the affected cards,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cAs far as what this means for the Dark Web, I suspect another site will take its place.\u201dMonrad added, \u201cAt this time, the source of the breach is unclear. It is not uncommon for rival underground actors to target their peers, both to demonstrate their skills but also to take out the competition. In the past, significant breaches of underground sites have aided in law enforcement activity.\u201dIn a follow-up post, Krebs said that the\u00a0administrator of Russian language cybercrime forum Verified, the hack of BriansClub \u201cwas perpetrated by a fairly established ne\u2019er-do-well who uses the nickname \u2018MrGreen\u2019 and runs a competing card shop by the same name.\u201dIt was originally conjectured that perhaps a white-hat or corporate resource carried out the attack \u2013 which brings up the hack-back discussion once again. The concept of hacking back \u2013 i.e., offensive cybersecurity efforts \u2013 has been a controversial one for some time. Opponents have twin beefs when it comes to the idea: Some are questioning whether legitimizing offensive attacks will open the door to a new kind of corporate warfare; and others are concerned that it would have a chilling effect on cyber-research by criminalizing white-hat activity like vulnerability research and pen-testing.Hacking back was in the limelight especially last year, when the governor of Georgia vetoed a bill that would make it legal in some instances to do so. It would have allowed \u201cactive defense measures that are designed to prevent or detect unauthorized computer access.\u201d\u201cIt will be interesting to see if other Dark Web sites become targets of hacking back,\u201d Jackson said.This posting was was updated at 6 p.m. ET on Oct. 17, to reflect the information on who carried out the attack.What are the top cybersecurity issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "Prices have been rising in the last two years for longstanding tools available on the Dark Web to help bad actors commit cyber attacks and fraud, alongside newer innovations that are emerging to bolster crimes like ransomware and SIM swapping, new research has found.Keeping track of these trends in dark-web markets for the tools and data cybercriminals depend on to commit nefarious acts can be a key indicator of where the next attacks will occur, according to a\u00a0new Flashpoint\u00a0report, \u201cPricing Analysis from Goods in the Cybercrime Communities.\u201d\u201cTracking pricing trends within illicit marketplaces is an important barometer that can inform decision makers about threats and the risk they present to private-sector organizations, public-sector agencies, and law enforcement,\u201d Ian Gray, director of analysis and research at Flashpoint, wrote a Tuesday blog post.Gray, who also wrote the report, said that an understanding of how prices and demand for tools fluctuate in the market not only provides insight into new developments within the cyber-crime landscape, but also can help dictate response efforts.Overall the report shows that while some cybercriminal tools remain fairly consistently priced and reflect the value of the crimes for which they facilitate, other pricing is wildly disparate and seems to follow no particular trend, according to the report.\u201cPrices can vary drastically across the [dark web], and the reasons for the discrepancies remain largely unexplained,\u201d Gray wrote.That said, the report saw \u201cmodest price bumps\u201d for individual-related personal information available on the Dark Web, such as passports, payment card data, bank logs and \u201cfullz\u201d\u2013which is slang for a full packet of someone\u2019s personal information that a cybercriminal can use to commit fraud.Fullz in particular remain a popular item on these illicit markets because they allow a bad actor to steal and profit from someone else\u2019s identity, Gray wrote. A fullz generally include a victim\u2019s name, Social Security number, date of birth, relevant account numbers and additional information.The range for a basic package of info is typically between $4 to $10, which is a slight price raise since 2017, according to Flashpoint. Cybercriminals also can purchase a more robust package of info that includes a victim\u2019s financial information for a higher price, in the range of $30 to $65, researchers found.Passports also remain a \u201ccrown jewel\u201d for cyber criminals on dark-web markets, but actual physical passports\u2014which are priced the highest\u2014are hard to come by, researchers found. Most of the passports available to cyber criminals on the Dark Web come in the form of a scanned copy where the vendor sends the buyer a digital scan of the passport with their information inserted, or a template for a U.S. passport where the buyer is free to input their own information, according to the report.Other services that are slightly more expensive than they were two years ago are DDoS-for-hire and remote desktop protocol (RDP) access to hacked servers or tools, the report found. Exploit kits that provide code for taking advantage of vulnerabilities also showed an uptick in price, researchers found.Pricing for DDoS-for-hire services in particular \u201chas noticeably gone up,\u201d most likely because content-distribution networks and high-value websites also have bolstered their protections against these attacks, Gray wrote.In 2017, the pricing for a DDoS botnet, a network of infected machines used by botnet operators to carry out attacks, was $27 at the highest end of the price range. The current report saw prices for these attacks between $1 and $100, depending on bandwidth and duration, according to the report.What are the top cybersecurity issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "A general-purpose info-stealing malware is poised to make a splash in cybercrime circles, thanks to its market niche: It\u2019s positioned as an ideal tool for low-skilled adversaries looking to get some skin in the game without having a lot of expertise.According to the Fidelis Threat Research Team (TRT), the Arcane Stealer V malware is an inexpensive .NET package \u2013 it goes for just $9 on the Dark Web.Functionality-wise, it collects various data from victims, including operating system, browser information, cryptocurrency wallets and instant-messaging sessions from Telegram, Discord and Pidgin. It also vacuums up passwords, cookies and forms from a variety of browsers, including Chrome, Opera, Kometa, Orbitum, Comodo, Amigo, Torch and Yandex; steals Word and .txt documents; collects Steam gaming community data; logs detected virtual machine IPs; and harvests data from FileZilla servers.Aside from the attractive price tag, Arcane Stealer V also woos those on the lower rung of the cybercrime sophistication ladder with a series of helpful GUI dashboards, and a support line available via the Telegram secure messaging service. The TRT team in a Thursday analysis saw that it also comes with various reports, such as statistics to showcase the potential amount of cash a user can \u201cearn\u201d with the malware within their specific geographic locations.Interestingly though, it has no geofencing or language-targeting capabilities, and is clearly marketed as a non-discriminatory \u201cspray and pray\u201d tool, according to the report.When it runs, the file collects the data, takes a screenshot and then it creates a text log file of what was collected. It generates a hardware ID that it uses as the folder name and zip folder name used to store the data, then beacons out to the command-and-control (C2) server to make a connection and send the zipped file along. After that, it goes dormant.As for Arcane Stealer V\u2019s author, TRT identified multiple Telegram and Twitter accounts with the handles \u201c@arcanee_bot,\u201d \u201c@es3n1n\u201d and \u201c@SakariHack,\u201d used to discuss the malware\u2019s build and distribution, all associated with the same Russian-language actor. The same handles are also used in the Steam gaming community. On the personal front, his profile on one site lists his age as 21 and references a struggle with epilepsy.\u201cThe actor associated with the malware appears to be a native Russian speaker, however it is unclear if the actor is currently located in Russia,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThe actor\u2019s information-stealer does not appear to limit potential targets. Analysts have observed the capability of Russian sites to be targeted in the malware.\u201dTRT researchers said that he or she sells the malware on their own website and on the Lolzteam site on the Dark Web, and TRT saw several cracked versions available for download on multiple community discussion and file-sharing platforms, like gaming forums and MegaNZ.While Arcane Stealer V is for now targeted at the lower end of the market, that could change, because the author does make available the raw code for sale too.\u201cDue to the lack of traversal, propagation, or destructive capabilities at the time of analysis, it is assessed with moderate confidence that this malware may not become popular with high-value and highly capable actors,\u201d TRT researchers said. \u201cHowever, because users can buy the source code, it is possible that we may see other threat actors reusing the malware and creating their own variant of Arcane V, as has been done with other popular malware families, like njRAT.\u201dWhat are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "By now, the vast majority of consumers have heard of the dark web. Even if they aren\u2019t exactly sure how it works, they know that it\u2019s the deep corner of the internet where \u201cbad things happen.\u201d Ever since the highly publicized seizure of large dark markets like AlphaBay and Hansa, It\u2019s become common to see ads for identity theft protection services that claim to \u201cscan the dark web\u201d for a mysterious hooded figure writing code to hack into your life.The reality of the dark web is a little different. For one, the original dark web networks from the 90s weren\u2019t necessarily developed to aid and obscure criminal activity so much as just to be truly anonymous \u2013 a characteristic that unfortunately makes dark web networks perfect platforms for buying and selling illegal goods and services, including your personal information.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the second big difference, it\u2019s not just one \u201chooded figure,\u201d but thousands of cybercriminals who make a day job of trading your personal information with their peers, cracking accounts and sharing (or selling) knowledge of how they did it. The recent successful take down of several high-volume markets by law enforcement might have slowed this daily trade and ended the careers of some novice and expert criminals, but it also forced cybercriminals to get more creative in how they operate in the shadows.Innovation is typically a word reserved for positive advancements in ideas, technology and strategy, but we cannot pretend that innovative thinking is unattainable by cybercriminals. Understanding how bad actors recovered from the major network takedowns and are shifting their operations to evolve with the current state of the dark web will help consumers and businesses protect themselves from becoming victims and allow law enforcement to stay ahead of the curve.\u00a0Here are some ways that criminals have adapted to develop the next generation of dark markets and operations.Innovative New VenuesThe complex coordinated effort between multiple countries and agencies around the world to take down AlphaBay, Hansa and subsequently other markets like the r/DarkNetMarkets subReddit sent a message to dark web criminals that they are not untouchable.\u00a0To avoid getting caught in any carefully planned law enforcement snares, many experienced criminals with established networks have resorted to strictly selling direct to trusted buyers rather than through potentially exposed marketplaces. IRC protocol, often considered the \u201cinstant messenger of the dark net\u201d allows for private conversations and transactions. In addition, the inception of darknet forums like Dread, the Reddit of the dark net, means criminals can network and form new relationships with potential customers, building trust and creating an opportunity for more direct sales.While new dark markets continue to spin up, their administrators are always looking over their virtual shoulders for law enforcement, so they often shut down just as quickly. Those that stick around are much more rigid about how business is conducted on their markets, and so are their users. Empire Market, for example, is essentially an exact design replica of Alphabay, but there are strong security features in place to prevent scams. Users often rely on third-party crypto-wallets to pay for goods, because many believe Empire\u2019s accounts are a trap. The Dread forum takes a different approach to stay in business, allowing users to promote their illicit goods and services all they want, but open trades and transactions are forbidden.\u00a0Cybercriminals need to protect their businesses too. In a perhaps ironic turn, many of these new dark markets are employing some of the same security measures that were designed to work against them.\u00a0 For example, one new market called Cryptonia Market, includes several new security features unprecedented on other dark net markets. According to Cryptonia\u2019s main page, it features a \u2154 Bitcoin Multisig implementation for payments, a transparent wallet-less escrow system for direct deposits, two factor authentication, anti-phishing (a common problem on AlphaBay) features with OpenPGP, and an automatic EXIF metadata stripper to ensure photo metadata doesn\u2019t give away GPS coordinates. \u00a0Innovative ToolsIn addition to new markets and their reinforced security focus, new and improved tools for obtaining and utilizing stolen information, PII specifically, have also come to light.\u00a0\u00a0Credential stuffing tools have become more powerful and more specialized, allowing simultaneous execution across multiple domains. These are often called \u201caccount checkers\u201d and exist in a few different forms, but all operate the same way \u2013 criminals leverage lists of usernames and passwords and check if they can successfully log into different types of accounts.Stuffing is a volume game, checking credentials against as many accounts as possible, as fast as possible. However today, the huge variety of security tools designed to prevent unauthorized access require criminals to use a little finesse before launching full-bore credential stuffing assaults. Today\u2019s account checkers are often specialized for different categories such as gaming accounts (Fortnite is popular), payment accounts or even pizza delivery accounts, and threat actors will work their way through different available checkers to find the one that best counteracts the specific security measures preventing their account takeover attempts.One of the newer security measures criminals will encounter is multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA has long been touted as a way to keep customer information extra secure, but sometimes there are vulnerabilities in the ways websites set up two-factor authentication (2FA) that can allow attackers to bypass it without much extra effort. If the attacker has access to their target\u2019s email account, password resets often skip 2FA. The attacker can request a password reset, change the password and will be automatically logged in after successfully changing the password \u2013 no text code needed.SIM swapping is another increasingly common MFA workaround where a criminal convinces a service provider to assign a new SIM card to a target\u2019s mobile account. This can generally be accomplished through relatively easy social engineering supported with key personal information that\u2019s not too hard to find about people, especially for practiced criminals. If an attacker successfully reassigns a target account to their own SIM, they now receive all texts, calls, etc. coming in and have access to stored data like text messages and security keys used through the mobile account.The abundance and low price point for these tools and the fact that some more seasoned criminals will offer them as \u201cdark web weapons-as-a-service\u201d means that even the inexperienced bad actors who are new to the dark web scene can begin operating quite lucrative credential stuffing operations.Innovative ApproachesJust like in any organized business environment, criminal or not, strategy and approach need to evolve with the operating environment. Criminals are pivoting and approaching business in different ways every day to become more efficient, make more money and keep law enforcement guessing.Even with the global crackdown on cybercrime networks, the underground is as active as ever and estimates project that cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion by the end of next year. While eradicating cybercrime is a futile goal \u2013 criminals will always evolve and adapt \u2013 staying aware of the ways criminals make their money and the tools they use to do so will help businesses watch for vulnerabilities, prepare for attacks and invest in the right defenses.Uncategorized",

        "raw text": "Ransomware continues to be a top threat,\u00a0with Friday\u2019s ransomware attack on 23 Texas local government and agencies and two in June on dual Florida cities \u2013 Lake City and Riviera Beach, resulting in a decision to pay off the hackers \u2014 acting as perfect examples of just how lucrative this type of malware is.Behind the scenes, cybercriminals aren\u2019t having as easy of a time selecting tools as it may seem. According to new research, after the notorious GandCrab ransomware gang shuttered operations in June, many have been left adrift.The recent Recorded Future study found that about 50 percent of posts on the underground were from buyers saying they don\u2019t know where to go, but expressing interest; while on the vendors\u2019 end, low-level actors are experimenting with developing and sharing their own ransomware strains.\u201cEffectively we\u2019ve reached a point in which there\u2019s a general interest in ransomware that\u2019s very large in underground forums, but criminals in this case still don\u2019t know where to look, and especially since GandCrab has retired\u2026 there\u2019s not really a vendor that has reached that level of popularity yet,\u201d Winnona DeSombre with Recorded Future told Threatpost in a video interview.Looking ahead,\u201dI would say that the thing that concerns me most is what vendor will emerge as the new primary ransomware vendor,\u201d DeSombre said. \u201cGiven how popular [GandCrab] was, I imagine that there will be multiple vendors trying to emerge that will compete in a similar manner.\u201dFor the full video interview, see below or click here.See below for a lightly-edited transcript of the video.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell:\u00a0Hi, everyone. I\u2019m Lindsey O\u2019Donnell with Threatpost and I\u2019m here today at Black Hat USA 2019, here with Winnona DeSombre with Recorded Future. Winnona, how are you doing?Winnona DeSombre: Good Lindsey, how are you?LO: I\u2019m good, just arrived here at Black Hat, so excited to see what\u2019s to come. So to start can you give an introduction to yourself?WD: Yeah, for sure, my name is Winnona. I\u2019m a threat intelligence researcher at Recorded Future. I focus a lot on East Asian hacking communities and also malware and data-driven research.LO: Great. So one thing I wanted to talk about today was malware trends and different variants that you\u2019re seeing that are becoming more popular. I definitely see that as something that will be discussed a lot here at Black Hat this year. And I know that Recorded Future just came out with a malware report on how different malware variants were referenced in underground forums, and you took the lead on that. What were some of the biggest takeaways there? What really stuck out to you about that report?WD: Yeah, for sure. So one of the biggest takeaways definitely revolved around the references for ransomware. And so effectively, we figured out that while ransomware was the most popular malware category mentioned over the course of the year, a lot of the actual specific posts surrounding those references, so like forum-vendor requests or discussions between different buyers and sellers, were related to any ransomware. So about 50 percent of these posts were either buyers saying, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t really know where to go, but I\u2019m interested in ransomware.\u201d And on the vendor side, people experimenting with creating their own ransomware. So effectively, we\u2019ve reached a point in which there\u2019s a general interest in ransomware, that\u2019s very large on underground forums. But criminals in this case, still don\u2019t know where to look. And especially since GandCrab has retired, they retired in June. There\u2019s not really a vendor that has reached that level of popularity yet.LO: Right. Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting, too, because I feel as though the popularity of ransomware \u2013 there was discussions of it decreasing in the past. And you know, this year, there was kind of a resurgence of ransomware, targeting state and local governments. Did you guys see that at all in your report?WD: Yeah.\u00a0So we actually wrote a separate report on ransomware, targeting state and local governments, there\u2019s definitely been a resurgence from 2017 to 2018. And even on the 2019 scale, it\u2019s actually supposed to either hit or exceed that if we\u2019re to extrapolate the data. But I will also say \u2013 fun fact \u2013 that even when you have these number of local and state governments that are being hit, it\u2019s not necessarily targeted. So you have criminals that end up infecting a machine that belongs to a local or state government, and then realizing \u201cOh, this is actually a government owned system,\u201d and then encrypting the important data there.LO: Yeah, I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s kind of almost like a spray tactic. And then they just happen to get lucky. And it just happens to hit Atlanta or wherever. Yeah. But that\u2019s really interesting. And so in looking at the report, were there any types of malware variants that really stuck out to you? Or did it really depend based on the different forums that you guys looked at? What did you see there?WD:\u00a0Yeah, so there were definitely different variants in different families of malware that were more or less popular, depending on the language of forum. So for example, mobile malware would be more prevalent on Chinese forums, followed by English forums, and then Russian forums, I will say that overall, in each of the top 10, for all of the languages analyzed, there were some similarities, though. So for example, you see really old malware at least showing up once on the top 10. So by really old, I mean, about three years old or even older than that, even some open source variants, which suggests that these open source lower-level pieces of malware are still successfully infecting victim hosts somewhere. There were also things like regular penetration testing tools, so Metasploit, HashCat, things like that were also being traded or reference to on underground forums. So any tool that was popularized by a red team may also be in the hands of a criminal.LO: So yeah, that brings up an interesting question too \u2013 when you guys were looking at underground forums did, was there a number of forums that you guys looked at? I mean, was it in the hundreds, was there any you specifically were trying to target?WD: Yeah, so I would say that within the scope of research, because this was 4 million posts, it was quite a number of forums. And I would say that it\u2019s not just the Dark Web forums that we focused on, we also focused on Open Web forums, as well as third-party chat applications and things where we knew criminals were operating on \u2013 or forums in which we knew criminals were operating on \u2013 because even though many people like to think that criminal monitoring is solely on the Dark Web or whatnot, it\u2019s really wherever criminals can communicate with each other online.LO: Right? Yeah. I mean, I even read an interesting thing the other month about social media, and how a lot of people are using social media to talk about malware and malicious activities.WD:\u00a0Precisely,\u00a0although there\u2019s a difference between talking about it and actually selling it.LO:\u00a0For sure. I had a question to0 about the malware in terms of, are you seeing more newer types of malware or more traditional malware that are either adding more modular function or switching up their tactics?WD: I would say that it\u2019s really last about the malware itself, and how it\u2019s being advertised \u2013 if it\u2019s updated regularly, frankly, individuals who are trying to purchase malware want to know that it\u2019s being updated or whether or not it\u2019s really worth their while to purchase. So what they look for is good vendors, things they\u2019ve seen in the news. Also, really anything that they\u2019ve seen as having good reviews on underground criminal forums or whatnot.LO: That\u2019s really interesting.\u00a0I guess my final question would be looking ahead at 2019 and beyond, what are the top malware related trends that you see coming to a head?WD: I would say that the thing that concerns me most is what vendor will emerge as the new primary ransomware vendor, the GandCrab affiliate program on on the underground criminal forums was so popular that if these cybercriminals weren\u2019t able to find GandCrab from their own means they would actually post about it in a variety of languages, asking where they could find it. And given how popular that was, I imagine that there will be multiple vendors trying to emerge that will compete in a similar manner.LO:\u00a0Well, something definitely to be looking out for. And I\u2019m curious too how sessions at Black Hat will really touch upon this. Thank you so much for talking to us.WD: Thank you for having me.For more top infosec news and videos interviews, subscribe to Threatpost\u2019s Youtube channel here.\u00a0Black HatFeaturedMalwareVideos",

        "raw text": "The cybercrime underground has become a service-driven, on-demand economy, including making available targeted corporate espionage services. According to an analysis, about 40 percent of Dark Web merchants offer spearphishing-as-a-service and targeted hacking services, aimed at infiltrating Fortune 500 businesses and other high-value targets.Typically reserved for well-resourced organized cybercrime gangs and APTs, these types of services are putting big fish on the radar for less experienced hackers, according to Mike McGuire, senior lecturer in criminology at the University of Surrey in the UK. His analysis, carried out in conjunction with Bromium and based on covert discussions with Dark Web vendors and picking the brains of law enforcement, shows that the underground has become a haven for such wares.\u201cThese services typically come with service plans for conducting the hack, with prices ranging from $150 to $10,000 depending on the company involved and the extent to which the malware was customized for targeted attacks,\u201d McGuire explained in the report, released Thursday at Infosecurity Europe.He also found that custom-built, targeted malware, with threats tailored to specific industries or organizations, is on the rise, and outnumbering off-the-shelf varieties of malicious code on the order of 2:1.The industries most frequently targeted by malware tools being traded on the underground are banking (34 percent), ecommerce (20 percent), healthcare (15 percent), and education (12 percent) \u2013 with targeted malware becoming increasingly popular to improve the effectiveness of campaigns.\u201cAlmost every vendor offered us tailored versions of malware as a way of targeting specific companies or industries,\u201d said McGuire. \u201cThe more targeted the attack, the higher the cost, with prices rising even further when it involved high-value targets like banks. The most expensive piece of malware found was designed to target ATMs and retailed for approximately $1,500.\u201dFurther, he found in his meanderings around the dark markets that access to corporate networks is sold openly \u2013 60 percent of vendors approached in the study offered access to more than 10 business networks each. In terms of verticals, banking and finance (29 percent), healthcare (24 percent), ecommerce (16 percent), and education (12 percent) corporate networks were the most common.\u201cThe methods for providing access varied considerably,\u201d McGuire explained. \u201cSome involved stolen remote-access credentials that are for sale for as little as $2, others involve backdoor access or the use of malware. Illicit remote access tools appear to be most popular \u2013 we were offered remote access trojans at least five times more often than keyloggers.\u201dThe study also showed that phishing remains a preferred method for infiltrating corporate networks, and vendors are catering to the demand with ready-made tools.\u201cPurchasing corporate invoices is easy on the dark net, with prices ranging from $5-$10,\u201d said McGuire. \u201cThese documents can be used to defraud organizations or as part of phishing campaigns to trick employees into opening malicious links or email attachments, which deliver malware that triggers a breach or gives hackers a backdoor into corporate networks which could be sold on the dark net.\u201dWhile the statistics are alarming, Adam Laub, senior vice president of product management at STEALTHbits Technologies, said that the findings should really come as no surprise.\u201cIf I were an attacker, I\u2019d be targeting large enterprises too,\u201d he said via email. \u201cWhile big companies may in theory have access to better or more resources than their smaller counterparts, it\u2019s much easier to hide amidst the crowd in environments with so many moving pieces, and thus, a much greater propensity for open doors to exploit. What you\u2019ll find in a large enterprise is more predictable. Sure, they\u2019re moving to the cloud like everyone else, but the good stuff is still largely on-premises, running off of dated and well-known technologies that attackers are comfortable working around. That\u2019s not to say smaller organizations aren\u2019t worth the time or effort, but bigger outfits have bigger everything \u2013 bigger file repositories, bigger databases, bigger customer lists.

        "raw text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the pressing need for security organizations to implement a structured, detailed and well-practiced incident-response plan. While the walls of organizations have extended from corporate offices to employee living rooms, security-control effectiveness has attenuated over a workforce of home networks and unmanaged assets.To add insult to injury, ransomware operators have opportunistically jumped into action to capitalize on this expanded organizational footprint. A concert of increased threat activity and reduced visibility makes it vital for organizations to invest the time in developing an effective incident-response plan to reduce business impact in the event their organization experiences significant compromise.To that end, let\u2019s discuss the key building blocks to building and testing an effective incident-response plan.Key Building Blocks for Effective Incident ResponseThe main goal of an incident-response plan is to minimize business and operational impacts from a security incident, of course. While of critical importance to an overall security program, IR plans extend beyond developing effective security monitoring to keep threats at bay, like increasing security operations center (SOC) automation and alert management, and they assume a post-compromise state to describe how an organization responds holistically when a malicious threat actor is cohabiting a network environment.Security controls are essential components to a meaningful defense strategy, but are not substitutes for investing in an IR plan to address a significant cyber-event. Overall, the planning process gives organizations the space to assess their program, build relationships with third-party vendors, and establish their response before a potential breach to maximize decision quality instead of settling for decision speed.One of the core elements to building a quality incident-response plan is candor. It requires objectively evaluating time-sensitive use cases that arise from a security incident and determining if your current bench is up to the task. Key questions to ask include:In the event my security team is notified of malicious activity, do they have the skills, training, tools and process to effectively investigate, document and communicate an incident to internal stakeholders?Does my organization have the ability to quickly respond and remediate active threats?When would we invoke our incident-response plan? Are there specific public disclosure or reporting requirements for my organization?Do we have the appropriate internal and external communication plans in place as threat activity escalates in an environment?It\u2019s important to note that being great at incident management doesn\u2019t mean doing it all yourself. Asking the hard questions guides organizations to building the right internal or external relationships, skills and processes to be fully equipped for an unwanted guest.Evaluating core use cases during a response event will guide the planning process to the next phase; Relationships.Managed security services and incident-response partners can help bolster gaps identified on your security bench, but incident management extends beyond information security to incorporate legal counsel and even the executive team.Many organizations struggle with timing when it comes to internal and external communications during an incident. Fostering a collaboration between information security and corporate legal partners will help organizations diminish escalation uncertainty for a higher quality response. Remember, incident-response plans are not just about the bits-and-bytes, but about minimizing overall company risk which includes defining messaging, law-enforcement escalation and abiding by industry disclosure requirements.It also helps if companies have key contacts for emergencies, an escalation criteria that determines the severity or priority of an incident, a way to track the entire process and at least one conference number that is always available when needed.If the three \u201cLs\u201d of real estate are \u201clocation, location, location,\u201d the three \u201cPs\u201d of incident-response plans are \u201cpractice, practice, practice.\u201d Incident-response plans require executive sponsorship, legal counsel coordination and information-security response for effective execution.The best plans are the ones that are regularly tested through tabletop exercises with all stakeholders participating with regular updates based on exercise findings, threat landscape changes, and NIST and MITRE ATT&CK guidelines. The highest-quality decisions around incidents are always made before being in the heat of battle.The Bottom Line: Be InvestedA good incident-response plan requires all stakeholders to be invested, and to have consistent practice, and will ultimately make it easier for organizations to minimize business impact. High-quality decisions detailed in your response plan lead to reduced incident costs, as the consequent losses of cyberattacks or non-compliance are much higher than investing in the right program, relationships and processes ahead of time.Grant Oviatt is director of incident-response engagements at Red Canary.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.Cybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "As an information-security professional, would you feel ready to respond to a state attorney in the event of a cyber-incident?Around half (47 percent) of organizations polled for Kroll\u2019s The State of Incident Response 2021 report said that their teams lack clarity around when to engage legal counsel about a potential incident. The potential impact of current and emerging cyber-incidents is so great that cybersecurity can no longer remain solely within the scope of an organization\u2019s information-security team. The multi-layered nature of incident response demands input from resources across an organization, particularly legal.We\u2019ll go through five key approaches for helping the infosec and legal teams work together in partnership, but first let\u2019s review some general best practices.At least two in five organizations are currently ill-equipped to respond to the full legal requirements of handling an incident, while 43 percent are missing a clearly defined process to communicate with regulatory agencies. In many organizations, legal teams remain a significant blind spot within infosecurity programs. It is imperative that they ensure that these two key teams are aligned in advance of an incident taking place.Sharing Knowledge Around Data Privacy & Protection Every organization that digitally stores personal and/or sensitive information is required to implement data-privacy and protection measures. This involves input from both legal and infosec teams to ensure collaboration for effective support on the standards and controls necessary to meet these requirements.Some privacy regulations, such as CCPA, HIPAA, CMMC and GDPR, provide specific mandatory measures that must be instituted when organizations electronically store customers\u2019 personal information.Data-mapping exercises are critical in identifying and cataloging protected personal information across an organization\u2019s network. This process should also be used to remediate any vulnerabilities necessary for meeting applicable compliance requirements. This process requires cross-coordination between legal and infosec, and should also include the development of a data-privacy program to create a roadmap to a privacy compliance process.Creating and Implementing Cyber-Policies and StrategiesIn the aftermath of an incident, it is understandable that organizations frequently prioritize financial concerns. After all, cyber-incidents can result in significant financial losses, whether that\u2019s as a result of theft, forensic investigation costs, remediation and rebuilding networks, or paying a \u201cransom\u201d or fines. Never mind the damaging impact on brand and reputation, and the potential loss of future business.However, organizations must ensure that legal issues are high on their list of cybersecurity priorities \u2013 not only post incident/breach, but also throughout the process of creating and revising internal security policies, strategies and implementations. This is especially critical when addressing new regulatory or legislative privacy requirements.Educating Legal on Baseline Cybersecurity to Optimize Programs Effective incident response stems from a reciprocal stance on knowledge-sharing. It is important for the infosec team to receive legal consultation on the development of a data-privacy program, while the legal team must also be educated on baseline cybersecurity. Legal will then have better insight into the nuances of implementing new policies or technologies to further these programs.The need for a symbiotic relationship between infosec and legal is never more pressing than when implementing new technologies. For example, the use of IoT devices which store protected health information (PHI), such as those used within the medical and health sectors, needs to be specified and addressed in an organization\u2019s information security policy and how it applies to regulations such as HIPAA. Careful coordination by legal will enable infosec to apply appropriate \u201cleast-privilege\u201d controls and configurations so that access to sensitive data is only provided to those who really need it.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations have come to rely on video conferencing software to communicate with co-workers, customers and clients. These platforms are often used for discussing sensitive, and sometimes protected, information, and therefore a compromise can have significant negative repercussions. Infosec teams need to coordinate with legal to understand what security controls should be implemented to protect sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized individuals.While the infosec team can suggest and implement specific technology solutions, legal should be consulted to provide guidance on what applicable compliance regulations define as \u201creasonable\u201d measures to meet mandatory minimum standards to protect this data.In Partnership: Key Actions to Take in Response to IncidentsToday\u2019s cyber-threat landscape requires the cross-coordination of infosec and legal teams to effectively respond to and recover from an incident, from a technical, as well as a regulatory and compliance perspective. The life cycle should generally follow these stages:\nIdentify the Nature of the Breach and Required Remediation \nWhen an organization identifies a potential intrusion or compromise within its IT network, infosec should coordinate with legal to provide continuous updates about the status of the forensic investigation. Legal will have the responsibility of determining whether a breach of mandatory reportable data has occurred, and the required remediation steps. The fact that an IT team was able to identify the root cause of a cyber-incident and contain and remediate the issue does not negate the need for a legal opinion on whether the \u201cevent\u201d was reportable.\nDetermine the Type of Data Exposed and Any Disclosure Obligations\nOrganizations should have an updated Incident-Response Plan that provides instruction on legal\u2019s involvement, and outlines the partnership with infosec around the effective preservation of evidence. By coordinating the specific details of a cyber-incident, infosec and legal will be able to jointly determine the type of data exposed or accessed, the source of the compromise and whether there are any required disclosure obligations.\nDefine Notification and Response \nInfosec should keep legal apprised about the scope and type of each event in a forensic investigation, so that they can determine the most effective response. Legal should then shape this response based on data-privacy laws and data-privacy policy, defined by the type of breach which has taken place.\nEnsure Compliance Meets All Appropriate Laws and Regulations\nThe complexity of data breach and cyber-incident disclosures is magnified when organizations operate across multiple jurisdictions, each with different disclosure requirements and timelines. This means ensuring compliance with regional, national and cross-jurisdictional laws and regulations. The chain of custody should then be handled by legal, with the support of infosec.\nPrepare for Litigation and Undertake Reporting\nLegal should prepare for possible litigation and provide guidance on potential civil, criminal or regulatory fines, while infosec is undertaking its investigation or restoring a network. Infosec will also need to update legal on the root cause of an incident and whether there was lateral movement in the network which may have potentially exposed protected information that would require mandatory reporting.These phases are all too frequently conducted in a disjointed way when, to be effective, they must be carefully coordinated. To achieve this, organizations should develop a clear strategy in advance of the immediate incident response.ConclusionDespite the increasing pressure created by breaches, the legal implications of incidents remain a blind spot for many organizations. It is only by fostering collaboration between their infosec and legal teams that organizations can avoid the potential pitfalls of incident response. This will allow them to create a transparent and streamlined route for staff to follow for quick answers and more effective response when an attack is underway and time is of the essence.Matt Dunn is the associate managing director for cyber-risk at Kroll.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.BreachHacksInfoSec InsiderPrivacy",

        "raw text": "In a startling discovery, a recent report found that 98 percent of companies have experienced at least one cloud data breach in the past 18 months, compared to 79 percent last year. The same report disclosed that nearly 60 percent of the 200 CISOs and security decision-makers surveyed considered lack of visibility, and inadequate identity and access management, a major threat to their cloud infrastructure.From ransomware threats to malware attacks, businesses across the globe are experiencing an overwhelming increase in cybersecurity breaches that are both devastating and well-coordinated. Whether designed for individuals to click on compromising web pages or open infected email attachments, most cyberattacks today target human error. In addition to the technology available to keep us safe, your organization also depends heavily on its people to make the right security decisions.So now more than ever, organizations must build up their defenses against persistent attackers who have for instance skillfully mastered the art of abusing weak credentials (one of the many risks, arising from people choosing convenient, easy-to-remember passwords or reusing them across accounts).Incident Response Plan ChecklistTo avoid having to go into emergency-recovery mode during an attack, corporations should methodically plan and prepare for cyber-incidents using the following incident-response checklist, for minimized damage and a swift recovery.A strong incident-response plan can help a company recover quickly and reduce incident costs. It\u2019s also critical to not only have an incident-response plan, but also to be \u201cincident-response ready,\u201d which means that the plan is periodically tested, similar to a fire drill.Ownership and Responsibility \u2013 The first step in crafting an incident-response plan is to determine the roles within an organization that will be held responsible for ensuring the program\u2019s execution. This includes the team members trained on the steps, tools and technology in place in the plan, and ensuring that the plan is updated to reflect changes or updates within the organization. It is wise for senior staff and executives to take ownership of the incident-response plan to ensure it fully and successfully integrates across all levels and roles of the business.\u00a0Roles and Contacts \u2013 In the case of an incident, all external and internal business parties are usually affected, including teams across the executive and C-level suite, legal, human resources, finance, marketing and sales. They must all know how their roles will be impacted during a cyberattack, and what will be expected of them to help the business recover.\u00a0Communication Methods and Contact List \u2013 During an incident, traditional means of communication, like email or V0IP, may not be available. To ensure proper and timely communication with customers and employees, organizations need to have contact details and alternative methods of communication prepared. This also includes a clear plan on what will be communicated to who and at what time.Recording and Identifying \u2013 Once an incident has occurred, all aspects and details of the incident must be recorded and documented. When did the incident take place? Who discovered it? At what point did the security and IT teams intervene? Along with these steps, it is crucial to identify the type and nature of the incident and confirm that it is, in fact, an actual incident.\u00a0Containment \u2013 Arguably, one of the most essential steps in the plan is containing the threat and stopping the attack. During this step, security and IT teams must decide if it is safe to watch and learn, or if they should immediately contain the threat (by pulling the plug on operations, which is very disruptive, of course). Additionally, security and IT teams must determine the scope of the attack and what sensitive data has been exposed. Use indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help determine the extent of the affected systems, and update any firewalls and network security to capture valuable evidence for forensics.Throughout this step, organizations need to anticipate potential legal outcomes and any impacts on regulations. Businesses need to ask whether their company\u2019s services should continue during the incident or if law enforcement needs to become involved, depending on the severity and sensitivity of the incident.Eradication and Recovery \u2013 One of the final steps of the checklist is restoring the systems and software to their original state. During this process, security and IT teams should collect evidence for proper digital forensic purposes and eliminate any lingering risks, so attackers cannot regain access. This step will include taking inventory of logs, memory, audits, network traffic and disk images, while patching systems, closing network access, resetting passwords of compromised accounts and identifying the root cause of the incident to prevent similar attacks in the future. Once recovery is underway, you must ensure system integrity, availability and confidentiality to return to business.Lessons Learned \u2013 It\u2019s important to reflect and learn from the cyber-incident. What worked efficiently, and what needs improvement? Taking the time to reflect and draft a response report will help your business better prepare should there be another incident. Learning from the incident will also spark change and further investments in people, training and technology, to improve your organization\u2019s security stature overall.Creating an incident plan is a time-consuming and daunting task, especially when it feels as if your company is invincible against attacks. But the fact is, with the ever-increasing size of the cyber-threat landscape, and the potential for human error, it is becoming more likely that your organization will become a victim of cybercrime.How prepared you are will determine the overall impact on your business? It is wise to have a clear and solidified incident-response plan to help your organizations do everything possible to reduce the potential impact and risks of a cyberattack. Be incident-response ready, and have a solid incident-response plan to help your organizations recover quickly.Joseph Carson is Chief Security Scientist at ThycoticCentrify.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.BreachCloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderMalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The coronavirus pandemic presented the perfect opportunity for security teams to evaluate the state of their incident-response process. In fact, it highlighted the dire need to implement a more structured, detailed and well-practiced plan to sufficiently support organizations when suffering a cybersecurity incident.Throughout the past 12 months, the lack of preparedness has become increasingly evident, especially with the influx of personal devices logging onto corporate networks, the resulting reduced endpoint visibility, expanded attack surface and surge in attack vectors.Mistakenly, security teams often work to remediate breaches as quickly as possible, meaning they skip over vital steps in the process. As the Navy SEAL mantra goes: \u201cslow is smooth and smooth is fast.\u201d Of course, speed is of the essence, however, it is important to not be sloppy and make sure the incident-response process is as efficient as possible.Unfortunately, companies don\u2019t only face external issues when trying to improve their incident-response process, even while security is becoming increasingly important. Indeed, internal obstacles play a large part in hindering security teams and working toward a better plan. But what are these obstacles, and why do they pose such a problem?What Are the Internal Obstacles to Efficient Incident Response?Security is frequently seen as a cost center rather than a revenue source, and stakeholders and companies alike often try to get away with spending the bare minimum. According to a survey conducted by Red Canary, Kroll and VMware in partnership with Wakefield Research, 45 percent of security leaders said their security spending will either stay the same, if not decrease over the next twelve months.As a result, security teams will lack the necessary resources to combat threats and, on top of that, will be required to provide a better security defense in a changing threat landscape. This creates a challenge for security teams as they must be able to position their findings in terms of business risk, and choose what is worth protecting, rather than providing full protection across all assets and accounts. Here, it is crucial for teams to help stakeholders mitigate risk wherever possible instead of trying to eliminate business functionality.Even with expansive security budgets and tooling, incident response can go off the rails without a practiced process. If the three Ls of real estate are \u201cLocation, Location, Location\u201d \u2014 the three Ps of incident response are \u201cPrepare, Prepare, Prepare.\u201d Minutes matter with incident response, so building an incident-response plan and regularly practicing it across the highest levels of your organization directly relates to better outcomes in the event of an actual breach.To add to this, many organizations believe they will not be targeted if they haven\u2019t previously suffered a breach. Forty-two percent of security leaders in the survey admit to their firm lacking organization-wide support to deal with cybersecurity incidents, 41 percent believe their leadership doesn\u2019t understand the initiatives, and another 42 percent think their security program only meets the minimum requirements necessary. These issues are further exacerbated when organizations decide against increasing spending in cybersecurity, as security teams are left with insufficient resources and expertise to deal with the incoming cybersecurity alerts.Implementing External Partners in Incident ResponseIf the past 12 months have taught us anything, it is that cybersecurity can no longer be an afterthought, but must be made a priority throughout every industry. This is especially important, as the vast majority of organizations surveyed had plans to automate some aspect of their incident-response processes in the next year. Unfortunately, automation is still being held back by obstacles, such as a lack of in-house expertise, supporting tech or platforms and security teams\u2019 excessive time commitments.One good option is for organizations to engage with third-party partners who can provide managed detection and response (MDR) to deal with the shortcomings and improve the incident-response process. Through MDR solutions, organizations can gain greater visibility across the entire network, along with investigation capabilities to aid in incident response. The survey results showed that 76 percent of organizations already use third parties as part of their process.Grant Oviatt is director of incident-response engagements at Red Canary.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.Cloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "From an irked former contractor in Australia sabotaging a sewage plant in 2000, to the more high-level 2017 Triton malware attacks on Saudi Arabian petrochemical plants, operational technology (OT) for critical infrastructure has increasingly been a cybersecurity concern.But now, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in shifts for employees as well as more remote access to facilities \u2014 which is presenting new, \u00a0unprecedented challenges for manufacturers, utilities and other locations.Threatpost talks to Lesley Carhart, principal incident responder at industrial cyber security company Dragos, about the biggest problems facing OT teams \u2013 and how they can formulate the most effective incident-response plans to keep up with sophisticated threat actors.Download the podcast episode direct here or listen below.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell-Welch:\u00a0This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell-Welch with Threatpost. Welcome back to the Threatpost podcast, everybody. And I\u2019m joined today with Lesley Carhart, to talk about operational technology security and incident response. So Lesley is the principal incident responder at industrial cyber security company Dragos. And she spent the last 13 years of her more than 20 year IT career specializing in information security, with a heavy focus on response to nation state adversary attacks. So Lesley, thanks so much for joining me today.Lesley Carhart: It\u2019s a great pleasure to be here. Thanks for having me.LO: Just to start, can you tell us a little bit more about your background and how you really worked your way into the OT \u2013 or operational technology \u2013 side of cybersecurity?LC: Yeah, so I\u2019ve always worked in nonstandard information security systems. Before Dragos I was at Motorola and they have huge factory and radio over IP spaces. And prior to that, I worked for some telecoms with big telecom deployments. And before that I was in the Air Force working on aircraft and avionics. So I\u2019ve always kind of been in the space of weird computer systems and what can be done with them. And I enjoy it very much. And it\u2019s a very important space that a lot of people don\u2019t think about.LO: Right, right. I think it\u2019s really top of mind, especially ot security right now, as it relates to nation state activity. You know, recently the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Russia government research institution in late October, saying it was behind a series of cyber attacks that used the highly destructive TRITON malware. So I think this recent government activity shows how governments and organizations are taking OT and industrial control system \u2013 or ICS \u2013 security more seriously. And, you know, just before we talk about what that means, on the organization side, and in terms of incident response, can you kind of set the context here in terms of what the specific security holes or challenges are that really need to be addressed, that exist and kind of are affecting these companies?LC:\u00a0Yeah, so there are the technical and organizational challenges there. There\u2019s both of those. First of all, these environments are very different from the IT environments in a lot of ways \u2013 yes, there\u2019s some similar technologies, and they\u2019re growing more similar over time, in some ways, but they\u2019re very different environments. And they have different needs and different priorities. So there\u2019s organizational and technical challenges here, because you\u2019re dealing with situations where if a piece of equipment fails, it\u2019s not \u2018Oh, the computers down and need to go home for the day,\u2019 it\u2019s maybe somebody dies or gets injured, or there\u2019s environmental contamination. So the consequences are very different of industrial failures that are caused by computer systems. And then again, you have the systems, the technical constraints, things like operations that have to run 24-7, 365 days a year with maybe one or two days off for for downtime and maintenance a year.So you\u2019re dealing with longer life cycles, less downtime, and a lot higher stakes in these environments. And a lot of these systems are in operations for 10, 20, 30 years, with only, you know, some some maintenance upgrades and not substantial system changes. So legacy systems, systems that are rarely patched because of operational needs, and then these great consequences that can potentially happen to the systems and the operators and the people in the surrounding area.LO: Right. And I appreciate that you mentioned organizational, you know, issues or challenges. I know kind of talking to OT experts that there\u2019s definitely a cultural difference there between OT and kind of the IT side of things, especially when it comes to patching, for instance, or if a factory needs to deploy an update or something that the fact that downtime is a lot more costly for industrial firms, and it really has kind of a bigger impact there.LC: Trying to plug IT security on top of operations has caused the water to be bloodied for many years, often times there are very hostile relationships between the IT and the operational teams because IT security\u2019s been trying to force what we consider standard cyber security models on top of the OT \u00a0systems, and it just doesn\u2019t work. We can do cybersecurity there, but we have to be adaptable and understand OT\u2019s needs.LO:\u00a0On the technical side of things. Is there any one or two specific challenges or security holes that you could pinpoint that lead to attacks or anything that are commonly used as an initial attack vector there?LC: Yes, so there\u2019s a lot of assumptions we\u00a0make about \u2013 as IT people or cybersecurity people \u2013 that we make that are incorrect about OT environments, and one of them is that they\u2019re all air gapped or close to air gapped. And that\u2019s really very, very, very rare. Usually what we see in semi-secure environments is simply a DMZ between IT and OT environments. And that just means a firewall with some access control. And that firewall might be full of holes, there might be tons of old rules in it that allow all kinds of things. So we see a lot of Swiss cheese DMZs between IT and OT there that are exploited and taken advantage of. And we\u2019ll see a lot of the lack of understanding of those environments. So people think that their existing IT security planning from monitoring to incident response or covering those OT environments, and they\u2019re not, they don\u2019t see what\u2019s happening inside them, they don\u2019t have enough contextual understanding of what\u2019s happening in OT. And therefore, when something actually goes catastrophically wrong, they either don\u2019t see it, or it takes them a great deal of extra extra time to respond to it, because they\u2019re just simply not prepared.LO: That\u2019s a really good point. I also wanted to briefly talk about kind of the threat actor sides of things as well. And I know that Dragos has done a ton of research around different types of ICS, or malware that targets ICS and OT, especially, obviously, TRITON or TRISIS, which you know, just for some background for our listeners is most notoriously known for a series of 2017 attacks on a Saudi Arabian petrochemical facility, where it targeted and safety systems, you know, with the aim of causing physical damage. But you know, there\u2019s also been a ton of other malware families that have popped up over the years, including Stuxnet, or Industroyer/Crash Override. What are you seeing on the threat actor level, you know, especially as it relates to kind of nation state activity as well?LC:\u00a0First of all, in terms of incident response, and I\u2019m out there responding to industrial incidents all the time; I\u2019ll divide what I respond to into three categories. So first one is insider threats. And, of course, people who work at plants can cause a lot of damage \u2013 either purposely or not purposely \u2013 if they decide to mess with things. So that that\u2019s very, very common, especially with the changes made post-COVID becoming a problem where we\u2019ve been allowing a lot more remote work and a lot more remote access to systems. The second category, of course, is commodity malware, and ransomware. While they\u2019re not targeted to impact low level industrial devices, in most cases, they can still wreak havoc in an industrial environment, because there\u2019s Windows systems there. And there\u2019s a lot of older and vulnerable Windows systems, embedded systems, etc., there that can be impacted negatively by ransomware. And cause things like loss of visibility or loss of control. And then finally, there\u2019s those advanced adversaries and in the industrial space, they tend to be well resourced adversaries. I\u2019m not going to say necessarily that they\u2019re all states, they could be, you know, contractors, other well-resourced criminal organizations, but it takes a lot of resources to really launch a successful purposeful industrial attack. You know a lot about the system, you have to know a lot about how it functions at a process level, and how to actually cause chaos and damage, in a system that\u2019s got a lot of redundancy and safety controls, physical safety controls, human safety controls in it. So they\u2019re well resourced people. And it takes them a lot of time and money and people to launch their attacks. And the thing about that is they don\u2019t want to just take every system in the universe down today, because that\u2019s wasting money. What they want to do right now, and what we see them doing is they\u2019re learning how to attack the people who they might want to attack in the future. And this is global. Adversaries targeting adversaries. They are learning how to attack verticals and pieces of equipment and specific providers and organizations, so that when they need to in the future, there\u2019s not this huge lead time to understanding how their system works. So we see a lot of reconnaissance going on \u2013 so adversaries breaking into tons of different networks all over the place, just to figure out how things work, just poke around a little bit and look at settings and configurations and build footholds in those environments. So they can at least get into the IT network of those organizations in the future quickly. That\u2019s what we see that the bulk of attacks being right now. And that\u2019s tough for the operators because it doesn\u2019t help build budgets. What helps build budgets and security, unfortunately, is being attacked and seeing a lot of attacks happening and we\u2019re not going to see a ton of attacks happen today in industrial control system security, because the adversaries don\u2019t have motivation \u2013 geopolitical motivation or whatever \u2013 to attack those environments right now this instant. But they are\u00a0breaking into them, they are hacking into their their organizations just to learn how to attack them successfully in the future.LO:\u00a0That\u2019s interesting. And it\u2019s a good point too that it is just to take note of how it is, you know, very expensive and difficult for groups to kind of launch these types of attacks. Although I do think, you know, one concern has been, you know, with with a certain threat groups, like I know, the group behind TRISIS, has been able to attack industrial control systems, across geographic and industry boundaries. There\u2019s a lot of concern that this might be a sign of more of what\u2019s to come when it certainly relates to nation state activity, as well.LC: Yeah, it\u2019s only going to continue to grow. They\u2019re learning more and more about their systems, they\u2019re getting more and more effective at launching attacks, very specialized attacks against specific systems, devices. They\u2019re learning. And some of that is just learning what attacks work and don\u2019t work. Sometimes the targets we see attacked with industrial attacks were simply the easiest place to break into and test a piece of malware, or see what actually could be done in another environment. So it\u2019s hard to tell, without boots on the ground intelligence doing spy versus spy stuff. But\u00a0in a lot of cases, some of that might just be, \u2018Hey, could we do this in another country or another city?\u2019LO:\u00a0Right. But your point too about insider threats is really interesting, because I, I feel as though especially in security news coverage, that\u2019s something that is not as widely talked about when it comes to industrial control system security. And like you said too, it\u2019s not necessarily always malicious. I mean, sometimes it\u2019s just more of an issue of human error, mistakes. So can you talk a little bit more about that, and what type of threat that can lead to?LC: Yeah, really, something that a lot of people don\u2019t know is the first thing I would call an industrial cyber attack against an\u00a0organization was an insider attack. It was long before Stuxnet. It happened in Australia at a sewage treatment plant, where a disgruntled guy who hadn\u2019t gotten hired full-time after a contract, and knew the system really well, decided to dump a bunch of raw sewage.LO:\u00a0Oh no.LC: It was a disgusting, horrible mess. And yeah, and that was totally an insider, I would consider it a cyber attack based on the technology used. Others might disagree with me. There were a lot of semantic debates there. But insider attacks are a big problem that don\u2019t get talked a lot about in the industrial space. Because companies don\u2019t want to admit that they had some fired engineer who retained access. That\u2019s an ugly piece of news to have out there. And for good reason. But yeah, I mean, a lot of it isn\u2019t malicious, a lot of it is, hey, these guys are locked in their facility now, due to quarantine restrictions for weeks at a time, of course, they want to watch Netflix, of course, they want to look at their personal pictures on their operator workstation. And those are problems that exist everywhere, but they can be a lot more severe in a sensitive industrial environment that\u2019s handling some some dangerous equipment.LO: Right. And I think that also brings up another point, which is, how things are shifting during COVID-19 and the pandemic? And can you give us a sense of \u2013 for those factory floor workers or for people who work every day with OT \u2013 how things have changed, due to the pandemic and what that means for cyber security threats or risks.LC: Our utility providers have gone vastly above and beyond for the last \u2013 What is it now \u2013 seven, eight months, during COVID quarantines and lockdowns. A lot of facilities are doing shift work. So they are, you know, taking a shift of people and making them work for a week or two weeks straight and live in the facility so that, you have isolated groups of people, if one gets sick, you still got another one you can pull in. And of course, that\u2019s a lot to ask of those operators and those engineers, they\u2019re doing an amazing job keeping things running even with people getting sick and things so they have obviously changed their operations, who they let into facilities, how long people work, when they work, where they work, all kinds of things like that. And there is more remote access being allowed to the facilities as well, so that remote repairs can be done, remote facilities, everybody\u2019s adapting to lockdowns and travel restrictions, things like that.LO:\u00a0Right. And that\u2019s across all industries. I\u2019d imagine but I\u2019m sure that you know, it\u2019s kind of heightened with with OT and, you know, what those types of landscapes entail. So\u00a0with all this in mind, you know, whether it\u2019s insider threats, or kind of the risk of nation state threat actors \u2013 all coupled together with these weird COVID times \u2013 Can you talk a little bit about what that means for organizations and how they can best prepare an effective Incident Response Plan, and from their end goal that can effectively, you know, prevent these types of security attacks.LC: Yeah, so I tell people, I\u2019m a terrible salesperson. Because, if people don\u2019t prepare either in IT, or OT, for incident response scenarios, what happens is, they have to call in the incident responder for X number of dollars per hour, which is a substantial amount of money. And that incident responder has to do all their preparation work before they can actually start incident response. We have to build out their asset inventories their network maps, figure out where their crown jewel assets are, figure out where their vulnerabilities are, we have to do all of that to do incident response, because that information is essential to figuring out how an adversary got in and what they did. So if you don\u2019t have basic incident response preparation done in either your IT or OT environment, you\u2019re going to see spending a lot more money when you have an incident to have it done by your consulting incident respondent, or even your on staff highly paid incident responders.And then on top of that, you need to have an OT incident response plan as well as an IT response plan. Because they are not the same thing. They are not the same environments. They use different technologies, different protocols, different people are involved, different technologies are involved, and the consequences are so very different. So your risk management is totally different. And I heartily disagree with anybody who tries to claim that your IT incident response and security program can just wholly cover OT and your ICS systems, it\u2019s just not possible. You need to specialize there, you need to understand what\u2019s going on, you need to understand the people and what they do in that environment, the process and where the potential points of failures are in that in that environment. So that means different asset inventories, it means different network maps, it means different risk modeling, it means different lists of things like crown jewel assets, and you know, content that you can use for forensic evidence. That\u2019s that\u2019s all going to be totally different. And it\u2019s going to have different implications.LO:\u00a0Right, I feel like you know, also, as more of these IoT devices are becoming more connected and digitized, it\u2019s becoming, there\u2019s just so much there to monitor and keep track of, whether it\u2019s end devices, whether it\u2019s different networks, as you mentioned, and protocols and so many different types of holes that can open up potential issues here. So it seems so vast.LC: It is it\u2019s a vast space. And a lot of people ask me, How do I get into industrial control system cybersecurity? And to me, it\u2019s the same question of how do I get into cyber security? Well, what do you want to do if you if you want to learn how to attack systems, how to defend systems, in the industrial space, if you want to learn about electrical power generation facilities, you want to learn about manufacturing, there\u2019s totally different vendors and protocols used in those spaces, different technologies, different standard layouts of equipment. So we really need to specialize and figure out where you\u2019re going to start. And if you\u2019re securing an environment with industrial devices in an OT environment, you need to understand what those environments are and what they entail.LO:\u00a0 I\u2019m curious too when you\u2019re talking to industrial companies and maybe working with them or looking at their incident response plans. Is there any big challenges or kind of overarching issues and with these types of plans that you\u2019re seeing, or any advice that you would give to organizations to kind of create the optimal type of incident response?LC:\u00a0Yeah, so everything that people expect for you to have in your IT Incident Response Plan and the basics there -things like network diagrams, contactless acid inventories,\u00a0collection management for your various log sources, things like that \u2013 All those things you need to have on your OT site as well. And they\u2019re going to be completely different. And I\u2019ve walked into so many organizations as an incident response consultant, where they hand me the OT Incident Response Plan, and they say, Oh, it\u2019s in here, right? And then I look through it and there\u2019s nothing about an OT asset inventory, what devices are there, what they do, what vendors and firmware revisions are in place. None of that\u2019s in there. And I say do you have this information. And then everybody stares at each other, and they\u2019re like, \u2018well, Joe Bob, who\u2019s been here 30 years might know, but maybe Joe Bob\u2019s on vacation, and none of this has ever been written down.\u2019 So\u00a0yeah, you need to do that preparatory work. You need to spend some time shadowing your operators and your engineers, you need to understand your processes. And then you need to start from the ground up doing those security hygiene things like understanding what devices are out there, what operating systems they\u2019re running. And this is not a security audit, this is not tell them to get off Windows 95, because they might be on Windows 95, for a good reason. But you need to know that these Windows 95 systems are there, and that you\u2019ll be able to do forensics on them. A lot of forensics tools are not going to run on your Windows 95 computer that doesn\u2019t have USB ports. That\u2019s a nasty surprise, if you\u2019re not familiar with dealing with OT systems.LO: Yeah, and I really feel like a lot of this too points to just the disconnect that a lot of organizations are facing between those IT teams and the OT side of things as well. I wonder if you know, if this type of disconnect could be integrated better in the future or something? Or if that would, would really help more with that type of incident response issue?LC: Yeah, absolutely. We have to build better relationships between IT and OT, and not just the technologies. We talked about like OT-OT convergence. And that\u2019s mostly about the techie stuff that they\u2019re using more IT familiar devices in OT, yeah, that\u2019s happening, but not everywhere, not at the lower level devices necessarily. And it\u2019s human relationships we need to build right now. Sometimes I go into these environments, and I call myself a marriage counselor because their relationship is so bad, they don\u2019t trust each other. They don\u2019t talk to each other. They don\u2019t have routine calls where they discuss cybersecurity. None of that\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s really unhealthy. And it bites them when they have an incident, when something goes wrong.LO:\u00a0Right, love that term \u201cmarriage counselor\u201d because I think it is so true when it comes to IT and OT and really what needs to happen there.So, Lesley, before we wrap up, is there anything else you wanted to mention about cyber security incident response in OT, or if there\u2019s anything we should be looking out for in 2021, relating to OT, security or anything else there?LC: Don\u2019t be daunted by OT being an overwhelming space with a ton of different technologies and different protocols and things like that. Start somewhere, start today, go meet the people there, start learning about what they do, start learning about the technologies in their environment. It\u2019s okay to only know part of it, as long as you\u2019re trusting your experts in your IoT devices. Start somewhere, start today, even if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed with the vastness of it all. Yeah. And we\u2019re going to continue in 2021 and beyond to see more exploitation of industrial systems, because the adversaries are clearly based on what we see getting very, very good at understanding those systems and having political from them.LO :Right. Well, Lesley, thank you so much for coming on to the Threatpost podcast and talking more with us about OT security from the threat side and from the how organizations can get more prepared side as well.LC: Absolutely, it was the pleasure to be here.LO: Great.

        "raw text": "Ransomware has become part of the cost of doing business, and driving down that cost can be the difference between recovery and catastrophe.A data analysis from Fox-IT, part of NCC Group, offers some best practices for how to minimize the fallout of a ransomware attack, after creating a dataset of 700 ransomware negotiations which occurred between 2019 and 2020.Once breached, the researchers explain the optimal response is none, but of course, that\u2019s a luxury most victims can\u2019t afford.Fox-IT cybersecurity analyst Pepijn Hack and Zong-Yu Wu, a threat analyst with the company, explained that when negotiation is the only choice, there are strategies to affect the best possible outcome.\u201cThere is a negative sentiment in our society towards paying or negotiating with criminals, and the legitimacy and ethics of it are also questionable to say the least,\u201d the report said. \u201cNonetheless, we realize that a significant percentage of companies currently do end up paying the ransom demand.\u201dRansomware Econ 101Ransomware groups already know how much their victims can afford to pay, the data shows. Their business model depends on them knowing how potentially lucrative a target might be and how likely a company is to pay.\u201cFirst and the most importantly, the total profit is not only influenced by the amount of ransom they demand from the victim,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIt also depends on whether the victim decides to pay, and the costs of the operation.\u201dCosts to ransomware groups can include fees to launder extorted cryptocurrency, ransomware-as-a-service fees and commissions, and the cost of carrying out the attack itself, according to the report.\u201cThe results show that the adversaries operating behind the dataset we collected knew how much ransom a victim is willing to pay before the negotiation had started,\u201d the analysts explained. \u201cAnother interesting observation is that smaller companies generally pay more from a rate-of-return point of view. In other words, a smaller company pays less in absolute amount but higher in percentage of their revenue.\u201dHow to Negotiate with Ransomware Groups The clock starts as soon as you click on the link provided by the ransomware group, the researchers warn. So, it\u2019s critical for the organization\u2019s staff to pull together a cohesive plan before starting the countdown. What is the breach? What is the best outcome for the organization? Who is responsible for communicating internally and externally? These are all questions that are fundamental to answer before proceeding, according to the firm.The researchers also advised anyone under attack to get the adversaries to switch communications to a secured channel immediately.\u201cThe first thing any company should do is try to set up a different means of communication with the adversary and if they do not want to switch, they should realize their communication is not private,\u201d the researchers added. \u201cIt happened multiple times that during a negotiation a chat got infiltrated by third parties who started interfering and disturbing the negotiation.\u201dThe next tip might be tough, but the report warned that being rude or mistreating the threat actor isn\u2019t in the organization\u2019s best interests.\u00a0Be Professional, Ask for More Time \u201cWe have seen multiple examples of companies getting frustrated and angry in conversations with threat actors resulting in chats being closed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cLook at the ransomware crisis as a business transaction. Hire outside help if needed but stay professional.\u201dThe attacker will likely try to rush the victims and force them into acting quickly, the report said. Targets should ask for more time if they need it \u2014 in almost all situations examined by Fox-IT, attackers granted their request for a deadline extension.\u201cThis can be helpful for several reasons. In the beginning of the process, you will need time to assess the situation and rule out any possibilities of restoring your data,\u201d the report said. \u201cSimilarly, it can give you extra time to produce different strategies. If you decide to pay in the end, you will need to make arrangements to acquire the right cryptocurrency.\u201dOther strategies include offering a smaller amount than demanded soon, with a promise for later and more flat-out trying to convince the ransomware group there\u2019s no money to pay.The researchers also warned that a target shouldn\u2019t tell anyone if there is cyberinsurance coverage.\u201cAlthough a company could still tell the adversary that the insurance company is not willing to pay, this limits the options for any negotiation severely,\u201d the report said.Other tips the report provides for those negotiating with a ransomware attacker are asking for a test file to be decrypted, proof files have deleted and a full explanation of how the attackers pulled off the breach.Even with those assurances, there\u2019s no way for a target to know their files won\u2019t be leaked or sold, the researchers added.\u201cEven if they properly deleted your files, who\u2019s to say any of the other people in the chain did not quickly make a copy of some interesting files for \u2018personal usage.'\u201dCybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "Everywhere you look, there are new reports coming out about ransomware. And cybercriminals are becoming more aggressive, demanding even more in ransom payments than ever before. According to Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42, ransom payments are up 82 percent in the first half of 2021, with an average payment amount at a record $570,000.So, with ransoms increasing and cybercriminals becoming more and more rapacious of users\u2019 data, there must be something organizations can do to stop these attacks.Stopping Ransomware Before it Gets to Your Critical DataIt\u2019s important to remember that we can\u2019t prevent all ransomware from gaining access to our networks, but that doesn\u2019t mean organizations have to let it loose to compromise everything. Well-prepared organizations can reduce the impact of ransomware by making sure they have deployed appropriate network-based security solutions.Employees, contractors, vendors and myriad other individuals can let cybercriminals gain access to your network \u2014 be it via phishing emails or by convincing them to access compromised websites \u2014 but the systems that they connect to are usually different than the systems that maintain your critical data. So, while your team members might have access to business-critical data stored on other machines, they don\u2019t (shouldn\u2019t) store it on their laptops.This is extremely important and works as a de-facto firewall for ransomware attacks because the attacker isn\u2019t accessing the critical data upon entry \u2014 they must find it first.To track where the ransomware is looking for business-critical data, organizations often use a network detection and response (NDR) solution. Unlike legacy, signature-based security solutions, NDR solutions use more advanced technologies, like machine learning, to detect suspicious traffic on the network. To learn more about solving for humans and why NDR matters, see this nearby article.What informs those NDR solutions is important, especially when it comes to ransomware. They must be able to track lateral movement.While having to restore a single employee computer is cumbersome, it doesn\u2019t come close to having to restore petabytes of data from customer or financial systems that have been compromised by ransomware. The key to stopping ransomware is to stop ransomware from getting on the systems that really matter. But how do you prevent the ransomware from getting to those systems? The solution to this lies in lateral movement.Tracking Movement Across the NetworkLateral movement is one of the most common techniques used by malicious actors to progressively move throughout the network as they search for critical data. This data is what the hackers really want, since it pays the most in ransoms (after all, nobody would be willing to pay $570,000 to restore a single employee laptop).While the idea of lateral movement is straightforward, one of the most important reasons for tracking network connections for for it is that it significantly reduces the dwell time for ransomware infections. Additionally, if the organization can detect the ransomware before it has the opportunity to lock out a system, the ransomware can be completely eliminated before any damage is done. The longer the ransomware is on your network, the more devices will be compromised.If ransomware is given too much time on the network, even if it doesn\u2019t gain access to your most critical data, it could have an impact on day-to-day operations. By tracking the ransomware\u2019s lateral movement, organizations can see where it moved, and, more importantly, which machines were infected. Doing so reduces the number of machines infected and thus reduces the time to recovery.Tracking lateral movement is only as good as the data being collected. When new machines or new employees connect to the network, organizations should start monitoring those connections right away. Doing so will provide the most visibility and will enable the organization to track malicious movement from all devices on the network.Additionally, understanding how malicious software is connecting throughout your network requires having an NDR system capable of collecting network flow data and analyzing it. By leveraging flow data, organizations can quickly determine where ransomware\u2014and other malware\u2014are moving across the network. If organizations can ingest high-fidelity flow data into their NDR system, they will have valuable details relating to the network traffic that will further reduce the amount of time that ransomware is left on the network.This type of information is exportable via IPFIX and many network hardware vendors support the protocol.Packet Capture or Flow Data? Which is Better?Packet capture offers many benefits to network and security professionals. It gives complete details of every connection happening on the network, which means organizations have the fullest visibility possible. Unfortunately, that absolute visibility comes at an unbearable cost.While it is theoretically possible to use packet capture to detect historical lateral movement, doing so is both cost-prohibitive and resource-intensive. This is because full packet capture requires storing many gigabytes or more of network connection data, which would also require having potentially thousands of PCAP or similar sensors to collect this data.After all, most network hardware would suffer significant performance degradation if packet capture were happening on the network directly. Since most malware may reside on a single machine for weeks or months before moving, most packet capture solutions would require IT teams to store terabytes or even petabytes of data in packet capture to maintain the historical data. This simply isn\u2019t realistic, given that high-fidelity flow-based metadata is equally effective at detecting lateral movement while requiring a significantly reduced footprint.What\u2019s Next for Ransomware?Ransomware isn\u2019t going away. In fact, it\u2019s only going to get worse. In recent news, Australia recently released a security alert alluding to the expected increase in more sophisticated ransomware. With ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) growing in popularity over the last few years, their spread makes it easier for malicious actors to harm organizations.But, by using a flow-based NDR system to detect lateral movement, organizations can quickly stop the ransomware from getting to critical business data and systems, reducing the dwell time and further reducing the impact the ransomware can have on the business.Justin Jett is the director of audit and compliance at Plixer.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.BreachHacksInfoSec Insider",

        "raw text": "Every security professional knows it\u2019s only a matter of time before their organization is breached. And even though most security-conscious organizations have implemented procedures and products to facilitate the incident response process, many security decision-makers find much more of a challenge in communicating the ongoing IR process to their management. That is not really a surprise; members of upper management are not necessarily security savvy, and the priorities of the security professional do not necessarily align with their priorities.Cynet addresses this challenge with a new Incident Response Reporting for Management Presentation Template, providing a clear view of the IR process and the output of this which is typically presented to upper management. The PPT aims to give CISOs and CIOs an easy and intuitive way to communicate to management the ongoing IR process and its conclusion.By using Cynet\u2019s new IR PPT template, security professionals will be able to more easily show upper management two main points that are of great concern during any incident response:Knowledge that the breach is under control: the main goal of incident response is first and foremost gaining control, achieving transparency of what has taken place and what items still await remediation. This means defining which investigations still must be carried out and what parts of the attack chain may still lie uncovered.Understanding breach cause and implications: When it comes down to it, management is concerned with productivity and not in what threats have gotten into the environment. Hours, manpower, data breach \u2013 these are the items on the top of the executive decision-maker\u2019s mind. The ability to map and present the attack chain through time is integral to getting management on board, with a full understanding of the importance of actions that must be taken \u2013 especially when the IR process is ongoing and still incurring cost.Utilizing the SANS/NIST framework, the IR template includes the below stages:Identification: Presence of the attacker is detected. Issues to be examined include whether the attacker was detected by a third-party, how advanced the attack is within the phases of the \u2018kill-chain,\u2019 risk assessment, and what steps will be taken with internal resources or whether a consultant service provider needs to be brought into the picture.Containment: As with any incident, the first step of triage is to focus on the main hemorrhage, the main attack point. Then there is the process of deciding which endpoints, users, servers should be taken offline, evaluating current status of all entities, and deciding how to move forward.\nEradication: A complete cleaning must take place, eradicating all malicious infrastructure and activity, then providing a full report of the attack chain development, its objectives and an analysis of overall impact on business (manpower hours invested, data breached or lost, regulatory issues, etc.)Recovery: An analysis must be made of rate of recovery and return to full function in regards to endpoints, servers, applications, cloud workloads and data.Takeaway Lessons: The final step is to review and assess lessons learned, including how and why the breach occurred, what were the items which enabled it (was there a lack of security in place, was it an issue of human error, etc.?). Then methods of improvement should be assessed \u2013 what should have been done differently, where can security be preserved or further improved upon, across the IR process timeline.Obviously, each security incident is different. Whereas in one case, identification and containment might be implemented as one, in another, containment might be a more drawn-out process, requiring multiple presentations to management on its progress. For this reason, the PPT template is modular and can easily be adjusted to the security professional\u2019s needs.Keeping management in-the-know and involved is integral to bringing critical decision-makers on-board during the IR process. The definitive IR Reporting to Management PPT Template provides an easy to use tool for security professionals to utilize in presenting their efforts, to clearly show how a security breach is effecting their organization, and what must be done to reclaim the organization\u2019s secure status.You can download the Definitive IR Reporting to Management PPT template here.BreachCritical InfrastructureMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Last year, Gartner published a market guide on network detection and response (NDR). Formerly known as network-traffic analytics, which I\u2019ve spoken about in the past at length, NDR has adapted to not only play a major role in helping network and security teams identify threats, but it has enabled these teams to respond to them too. This change in name means that network data is becoming more and more important in stopping threats and is a key component to a multi-layered security posture.With this in mind, what does NDR mean for the future of cybersecurity as we prepare for the rest of 2021?Cybercriminals Still Hack HumansWhile technology evolves, and network and security professionals develop more sophisticated techniques to stop attacks, one thing remains true: Humans are still a big problem in the equation. Truthfully, humans are still the biggest problem (check out this article nearby on how to deal with some of these problems when you have fewer resources).A recent post by Fortinet shows that social engineering and phishing are still major contributors to attacks. Specifically, timely attacks are often extremely effective at exposing individual\u2019s vulnerability and enables cybercriminals to take advantage of people.This is so much the case that the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) posted a \u201cVerify Your Valentine\u201d notice ahead of Valentine\u2019s Day to help reduce the number of people that fall victim to cybercriminals. And, another article posted by Nevada IT Solutions highlights how human negligence is a major contributor to cyberthreats.Even outside of the intricate Valentine scams, as the number of people working from home has increased (and for the most part remains at an all-time high), the vulnerabilities have also increased as businesses have had to adapt standards to include remote/home networks attached to the business. All the while, cybercriminals have been continuously building their attacks as the world managed around COVID-19.Some Big Changes to BusinessFortunately, there does seem to some light at the end of the tunnel around these kinds of attacks. As network-traffic analytics has moved to NDR \u2014 largely thanks to machine-learning improvements\u2014businesses have been planning for major changes in cybersecurity, according to a recent article in Forbes.Specifically, 96 percent of enterprise executives are planning to adjust their cybersecurity strategies, and 55 percent indicate an increase in cybersecurity budgets. The biggest thing is that the new strategies will rely more and more on \u201cautomated, adaptive cybersecurity.\u201dThis is precisely what NDR is built around: Taking network traffic metadata and using machine learning and/or artificial intelligence to quickly identify threats and automate the response. This is great news because the human problem is not only the problem for how cyberattacks are allowed on a network, but the human problem can also be attributed to how cyberattacks are missed once they are on the network.Solving for Humans: Post-AttackAs the number of false positives increases in a given cybersecurity platform, the likelihood that a person looking at those alerts will ignore or miss a real threat also increases. This is just a simple math problem, since people can only ingest so much data before being overloaded and the noise takes over.To solve this problem, network and security teams need a system that will provide them with the fewest alerts and that provides context to help understand the nature and severity of the threat. In a recent CSO article, among other things, it\u2019s problematic if \u201ca metric doesn\u2019t provide any context as to whether it\u2019s good or bad, or leaves you and your team unsure of how to derive meaning and act on it.\u201dThis is particularly a problem for log-aggregation systems like those provided by security information and event management (SIEM) systems, because log data provides extremely factual information, but no insight as to what it means. Usually one needs to dig much further into other systems to find an answer. This exacerbates the issue, because in the short amount of time available for IT teams in a day, digging deeply into multiple systems to find a problem can add additional blindness to the team.Instead, network and security teams should come together to share valuable network data in a system that not only provides a low number of false positives (most vendors will say that they can do this), but that also enables actionable and contextual insight into attacks. An added bonus is enabled automated responses, but it may take some time before security and network professionals are willing to let machine-learning algorithms determine when to make network changes or quarantine devices on the network.Until then, NDR systems will continue to provide a platform to reduce the human challenges of creating havoc on the network and not identifying the problem quickly enough once those threats appear. \u00a02021 is shaping up to be the year of NDR, and that just might make the human problem less of a problem.Justin Jett is the director of audit and compliance for Plixer.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.\u00a0InfoSec InsiderVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Organizations are increasingly outsourcing incident response situations to service providers. This is taking place across the spectrum \u2013 from cyber mature companies with highly staffed SOCs, to small operations with no dedicated security personnel. This keeps the IR providers busy, putting the onus on them to maintain highest level services while being able to scale quickly.With this in mind, Cynet is making available a unique offering for IR service providers, giving them free access to the Cynet 360 platform to accurately and rapidly identify, analyze and remediate threats on their customers\u2019 environments during incident response situations. IR providers can now sign up and immediately get access to the platform for free.\u201cWith the Cynet 360 platform, Incident Response professionals get exceptional speed and accuracy, two crucial aspects of incident response,\u201d said Cynet co-founder and president Eyal Gruner \u2013 himself a leading expert in offensive security and IR. \u201cThe platform gives them immediate visibility into all activity across the organization, enabling them to easily and accurately home in on and remediate malicious presences, returning the system to its previous clean state.\u201d Gruner presents Cynet as the fastest IR tool on the market, with highest accuracy, and is providing for free to incident responders as a hands-on way of introducing them the tool.As most security professionals are aware, speed is of essence in IR, where every second can mean additional damage throughout the organization. When a breach is underway, until the attacker is identified, the damage assessed, and all malicious items and activity purged \u2013 an Incident Responders work is not complete.The work of an IR service provider is crucial to the safe daily functions of the organizational network, and requires that they carry out thorough forensics into the entire internal network, including every endpoint, which can number in the tens of thousands, all user accounts and network traffic. With most IR toolsets, though, these investigations must be carried out manually, and, while relying on drawn-out workflows.Cynet\u2019s 360 platform is ready out-of-the-box, for fast, easy deployment across all endpoints. IR providers get immediate visibility into all the activity in the network \u2013 all from one user-friendly dash, and very different from most security tools which require manual installation on every individual endpoint.With Cynet 360, IR service providers get:Immediate time-to-value \u2013 Cynet 360 enables fast, reliable onboarding of the IR provider, so that they can quickly analyze and clean the organizational environment, scaling as needed, and returning their clients a clean, functioning environment.Full network visibility in 60-minutes \u2013 Incident data correlation and analysis is automated, including event prioritization, risk ranking for every host, process, user account and network destinations.Active Threat Detection \u2013 Cynet raises a real-time alert, for any active threat within the network \u2013 this includes malicious file execution, attacker-controlled traffic and other post-compromise malicious activity.Threat remediation \u2013 Cynet gives users multiple remediation capabilities, ensuring the broadest types of actions and in the remediation toolset to apply to infected endpoints, malicious processes/files, compromised user accounts and attacker-controlled traffic.Cynet Custom RemediationsCynet Environment Visibility\u201cThis is major,\u201d said Gruner. \u201cWe\u2019re giving IR professionals a free tool that can actually make a difference in how they handle incidents \u2013 immediate visibility, quickly scaling at immense volume, rapid remediation. We look forward to mainstream adoption of the Cynet 360 platform as soon as the word gets around and are happy to be helping incident responders get the job done.\u201dRead more on the Cynet Respond at the Speed of Light free offer here.Web Security",

        "raw text": "MangaDex, the online repository of manga animation comics, will be closed until further notice following a hacking incident.Last week, the site reported that a cyberattacker had gained access to an administrative account, \u201cthrough the reuse of a session token found in an old database leak through faulty configuration of session management.\u201dAfter remediating the issue by clearing all sessions globally, the site\u2019s builders took a look at the code that runs MangaDex, trying to patch any vulnerabilities they came across as they went along. However, while the code review was ongoing, the same adversary was then able to access one of MangaDex\u2019s developer accounts, stealing the site\u2019s version-three source code. The attacker\u2019s likely motivation was to cause \u201cmaximum disruption\u201d to the site, according to MangaDex.\u201cWhile the attacker gained access to information not typically visible from the context of a normal user, we have not been able to confirm a full host compromised, or an up-to-date database breach,\u201d the site announced. \u201cAs a user, we will encourage that you would assume that your data has been breached, and take precautions immediately, such as changing the passwords of any accounts that might share the same password as your MangaDex account. As a generally good security practice, password managers are highly recommended to keep your online identity secure.\u201dMultiple Site VulnerabilitiesThe attacker also taunted the site\u2019s operators with knowledge of security bugs in the codebase, which is the main reason that MangaDex went offline, it said.\u201cThe attacker had updated the git repository containing the source-code leak, claiming that we had successfully patched two out of three possible CVEs,\u201d according to a website notice posted on Sunday. \u201cWithout any way to confirm the claims, we assumed the worst-case scenario and kept the site down to further investigate.\u201dVolunteer-run MangaDex plans to take the time it needs to complete a site re-write that will be based on version five of the source code. That could take as long as three weeks, it estimated.MangaDex plans to expedite its return by going online once the basic functions of version five are ready: Namely, to allow readers to read and follow manga titles and to allow groups to upload \u201cscanlations\u201d of comics.\u201cInstead of keeping up a likely vulnerable website and wasting our time and efforts playing cat-and-mouse with constant attacks from [distributed denial of service] DDoS to hacking, we have decided to take this opportunity to refocus and expedite our planned rewrite of the site,\u201d according to the notice. \u201cContrary to our original plans, however, we will be launching this v.5 as soon as the minimum essential features are ready.\u201dThe site has in the meantime invited ethical hackers to help find the security vulnerabilities claimed by the attacker in the codebase, along with any other flaws.Potential Bug-Bounty ProgramWhile MangaDex is for now relying on volunteers to find and rectify security vulnerabilities \u2013 the site said these helpers have already identified \u201ca good number\u201d of bugs \u2013 a more formal program could be in the offing.\u201cWe are still open to any suggestions or responsible disclosures of vulnerabilities found in the leaked v.3 source code,\u201d according to the notice. \u201cWhile we have found numerous at time of writing, and have moved to patch most of it, we appreciate all attempts at helping us to find more.\u201dFurther, it said that once the new site is live, it may implement bounties for the finds.\u201cWe sincerely intend to improve upon the security on existing and future infrastructure, and while some of our developers have experience in the security fields, we have decided that having some form of a bug-bounty program for v.5 will only prove to be beneficial to MangaDex,\u201d according to the notice. \u201cAs means of backing that, we intend to consider payouts depending on the severity of reported bugs.

        "raw text": "We have all heard of the \u201ccybersecurity skills gap\u201d \u2013 the inability of firms to hire and retain high-level cybersecurity talent.\u00a0 This gap has been manifesting in two ways.\u00a0 First, companies that want to hire cybersecurity talent simply cannot find candidates with sufficient skills.\u00a0 Second, companies that cannot afford specialized cybersecurity talent and therefore lack the necessary skills to adequately protect their organizations from the growing and increasingly sophisticated cyber threats.\u00a0 Both of these are real problems and both can lead to devastating consequences.\u00a0 It\u2019s also fair to say that most cybersecurity teams today are overworked and understaffed.One of the primary reasons we need such high-level cybersecurity skills lies in the shortcomings of cybersecurity technologies. Due to the changing and increasingly sophisticated stream of attack techniques, the breadth and depth of cybersecurity defensive technologies used to combat these threats and protect an organization against breaches has exploded.\u00a0 Today, there seems to be a specialized tool to cover every part of the attack surface and response process.\u00a0 Unfortunately, all but the largest organizations with the deepest pockets can afford to acquire and then adequately integrate and maintain the expansive set of technologies required to protect the modern-day organization from breaches.\u00a0 Most smaller companies suffer from a lack of technologies to protect their organizations.We are in dire need of approaches that simplify and consolidate the cybersecurity toolset so that companies can afford the coverage required and to make effective breach protection accessible to those other than world-class experts.Enter CynetOne company that really seems to get the need for simplification, without sacrificing the effectiveness, is Cynet.\u00a0 Cynet was formed specifically to consolidate multiple threat prevention and detection controls into a single offering for two primary reasons.\u00a0 First, keeping all the controls on a single platform allows for far better results than integrating and managing technologies from multiple providers.\u00a0 Second, it greatly simplifies the technology stack (not to mention affordability improvements).\u00a0 Then, Cynet goes beyond these benefits by automating many of the common workflows required to respond to cyber threats that would otherwise require high-level skills, time, and effort.Product Overview: Cynet 360, 2020 Fall Platform UpdateThe Cynet 360 platform is built on three pillars; Extended Detection and Response (XDR), Response Automation, and Managed Detection and Response (MDR).\u00a0 These three components together provide what Cynet calls Autonomous Breach Protection \u2013 essentially breach protection on auto-pilot.\u00a0 Let\u2019s look at each of these components.XDRWhile XDR is considered a new technology \u2013 it\u2019s something Cynet has been doing since its inception.\u00a0 XDR technology essentially combines signals from multiple control points as part of a single platform to provide better results than when deploying multiple siloed controls and then trying to figure out the stream of alerts and data from each.\u00a0 Many analyst firms are touting XDR as \u201cthe next big thing in cybersecurity.\u201dThe Cynet XDR (learn more about it here) combines prevention, detection, and data from:Endpoint Protection \u2013 Next-Generation AntiVirus (NGAV) for basic endpoint malware prevention and detection and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) for more advanced endpoint protection, detection, and responseNetwork Traffic Analysis (NTA) for identifying malicious activity on your networkEntity and User Behavior Monitoring (EUBA) to detect anomalous user behaviorsDeception technology to trick successful intruders into exposing their presence before damage can be doneResponse AutomationCynet automates many tasks associated with threat detection response and cross-environment remediation including infected hosts, compromised user accounts, malicious processes and attacker-controlled network traffic.The New Cynet Incident EngineCynet\u2019s new Incident Engine can immediately improve cybersecurity operations for any company, and help full the cybersecurity skills gap.Many solutions can detect threats and then automatically prevent them from executing and causing damage.\u00a0 This is wonderful and helpful, but only represents the first step in addressing a threat.\u00a0 We must assume that the threat discovered is likely only the tip of the iceberg and is likely only a piece of a larger, coordinated attack. This is where the cybersecurity skill gap becomes dangerous.The Cynet Incident Engine triggers an automated investigation following certain high-risk alerts, fully disclosing its root cause and scope, and applying all the required remediation activities.\u00a0 This is offered on a single platform, out of the box, ready to bring your cybersecurity to the next level on day one. This, my friends, is the most amazing and useful cybersecurity breakthrough I\u2019ve seen in some time.How it WorksOn certain high-risk alerts, customers can click the Incident View button:This leads to a page that displays the full set of investigation steps and remediation actions that the Incident Engine performed as soon as the threat was detected.As shown in the screenshot below, a simple workflow diagram shows the series of investigation queries and results (blue) that lead to findings (red) that are addressed with remediation (green).\u00a0\u00a0 The Timeline on the right shows a more detailed description of every step, while the Incident Artifacts display the attack flow. The full incident is summarized in the upper text boxes.In the following example, we see an Unauthorized Memory Access Attempt alert that was triggered by an attempt to dump credentials \u2013 a common attack scenario. The initial alert indicates that Cynet neutralized the attempt and that the credentials were not accessed. The Incident Engine then does its thing \u2013\u00a0 it isolates the compromised host against from which the attack was launched and reveals a lateral movement.\u00a0 It turns out that the attack was actually launched remotely from another host in the environment, which is the true root cause. This finding is concluded by isolating the root cause host as well.This off-the-shelf automated root cause analysis, impact investigation, and remediation actions took Cynet\u2019s platform just under seven minutes to fully perform, all in the background, saving literally hours of analyst effort.\u00a0 Or, it performed a series of tasks to find and remediate threats that some organizations would not have known were necessary or how to do them.\u00a0MDR \u2013 CyOpsCynet calls their MDR team of cybersecurity experts CyOps.\u00a0 I find it amazing that Cynet includes 24\u00d77 monitoring for all clients to ensure any real attacks are not overlooked.\u00a0 They also provide ad-hoc threat investigations and forensic analysis and guide their clients through any necessary remediation steps. CyOps is automatically included in the Cynet platform \u2013 at no additional cost.This type of service is typically quite expensive and oftentimes only available from third-party providers.\u00a0 With CyOps intimate understanding of the Cynet platform, they can provide far superior service than MDR teams that some vendors contract with to support their platform.\u00a0 Learn more about CyOps here.SummaryThe fully automated Incident Engine, coupled with Cynet\u2019s full Extended Detection and Response (XDR) platform and included Managed Detection and Response (MDR) service, provides quite a cyber protection package for any organization.Many companies continue to rely solely on EDR or a combination of EDR and NGAV to protect the organization from cyberattacks and breaches.\u00a0 Alternatively, Cynet\u2019s solution provides a more complete prevention and detection capability along with fully automated response actions and a full 24\u00d77 MDR service to boot.\u00a0 If I were suffering from a lack of cybersecurity resources, as most companies are, my first call to improve my situation would be to Cynet.Sign up for a Free Trial of Cynet 360 hereWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Today, managed detection and response (MDR) is a rapidly growing market segment, actively pursued by some 27 percent of organizations, according to April 2019 numbers released by ESG Research.According to the same, another 11 percent of organizations plan to pursue MDR in the future.The Cynet 360 platform allows security-focused managed service providers (MSPs) to get ahead of their competition by adding MDR to their offerings in the form of the platform\u2019s integrated autonomous breach protection capabilities, plus CyOps, its 24/7 SOC team (learn more here).A product of the last few years, MDR was created to assist organizations by making a team of experts available for services beyond what their in-house security team can provide. This includes items such as 24/7 alert prioritization, investigation and proactive threat hunting. With the Cynet 360 platform, organizations gain security for endpoints, network and user accounts, and the MDR provider can promise real-time protection against threats throughout the organization via a single integrated solution.As Threats Evolve, So Do Detection SolutionsAs the advanced threat landscape has changed, the security industry has responded with various detection offerings. These alert organizations when malicious activity is found in the environment. This area includes offerings such as endpoint detection and response (EDR), user behavior analytics (UBA), network analytics and deception, and all can be added to the security arsenal available to the organization.Gap in Security Skills Means Detection Solutions Do Not Deliver Full ProtectionThe skills gap is a well-known issue in the security industry. As a result of this, plus the high number of alerts that many detection solutions produce, a solution\u2019s full protection potential is usually not achieved. Between the false positives and the need to prioritize true critical alerts, and then the need to utilize security technologies to hunt undetected threats, most security professionals have their hands full. To put is simply, many threats go undetected. All it takes is one missing link in the operation of an advanced threat detection product, and the organization is left open to attacks, no matter how much is spent on security solutions.Solve the Skills Gap with MDR \u2013 Skills-as-a-ServiceWith MDR, the security skills gap is no longer an issue. MDR allows security providers to offer organizations the ability to use the services of a team of 24/7 SOC security experts who receive, prioritize and analyze alerts, in place of taxing their own staff. This helps cut down on alert fatigue, which happens when a security team is constantly inundated with multiple alerts, and does not \u2018see them\u2019 anymore \u2013 thus no longer handling then effectively. Now in the hands of the MDR team, security alerts are received, prioritized and the customer organization is advised how to handle them and what remediation steps should be taken, according to severity.\u00a0What\u2019s Required to Implement an MDR Detection SolutionIt is up to the MDR provider to ensure that the technology they use to detect and protect the customer environment covers all main attack vectors, including endpoints, the network and user accounts. This means the solutions should both detect malicious activity and ensure full visibility into all activities across the organization. MDR providers must be able to promise all this, plus the ability to carry out in-depth investigations, as the need arises.The Cynet 360 Platform for MDR ProvidersWith Cynet 360, MDR providers can provide a first-of-its-kind solution to their customers: Protection across the endpoints, user accounts and the network itself, in one solution. Installation is fast and easy (500 endpoints in one hour) and alerts are issued across all main attack vectors. This includes malware, exploits and fileless attacks on hosts, anomalous login and connection of user accounts, network-based attacks such as address resolution protocol (ARP) spoofing, lateral movement and data exfiltration. Learn more on Cynet for MDR providers, here.One Product for Full VisibilityComplete threat visibility can only be achieved by integrating multiple solutions covering EDR, UBA, network analytics and deception. With Cynet 360, providers can provide all this in a single solution. This allows for rapid scaling while meeting the needs of multiple customers, without encountering the usual deployment and integration roadblocks. With Cynet 360, an MDR provider is focused on giving their customers the security they need with alert management and proactive threat response, without the typical distractions.Accurate Alerts Across Critical Attack VectorsIn many cases, malicious process execution cannot be determined without the context of surrounding activity in associated user accounts and network traffic. Cynet 360\u2019s monitoring of endpoint, network and user activities means the platform is able to provide the full picture of an attack operation over time, with its entire context, cutting the false positives to an absolute minimum. These are the critical threats that are often missed by most siloed solutions such as EDR, network analytics or UBA.Cynet\u2019s CyOps 24/7 SOC \u2013 Backing the MDR Security TeamCynet\u2019s expert security researchers and threat analysts are online 24/7, monitoring alerts, investigating malicious activity and actively threat hunting. The CyOps SOC is an 80/20 percent mix of technology and services, of which MDR providers can take advantage to augment their own team and offer their customers the best in frontline security. Alternatively, MDR providers can decide to market CyOps services as a white-label model, while focusing on building their own team.To learn more about Cynet 360 for MDR providers, click here.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BreachHacksMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Hundreds of German politicians, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, have been doxxed in a puzzling incident, with their private information and political documents dumped online. At least one local reporter is claiming the information is explosive.According to a report from German public broadcaster RBB, the victims hail from all major parties \u2014 except the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The information released includes emails, cell phone numbers, physical addresses, private chat conversations, pictures of their ID cards and even bank details and debit authorizations. The data also included internal party documents, according to RBB, as well as \u201cvery personal data\u201d such as conversations with family members.Links to the data were tweeted out by a Twitter account @_Orbit in the form of an Advent calendar leading up to Christmas \u2013 but no one took notice of it until Thursday night. It\u2019s unclear why the tweets didn\u2019t attract attention until now \u2013 the same account (now suspended) has been doxxing people, according to the report, since the summer of 2017 and had amassed more than 16,000 followers.German newspaper Bild said that the entire German cabinet was victimized, along with various German musicians and comedians. While early reports said that there was nothing politically sensitive amongst the data, Julian R\u00f6pcke of Bild tweeted that he had found \u201cshocking\u201d details related to nepotism, and that the data stretches back to 2009. He also speculated that more compromising material may be in the offing:First German MPs receive Twitter messages, asking them to admit their real sexual preferences.The hackers obtained pornographic material of them \u2026#BTleaks\u2014 Julian R\u00f6pcke (@JulianRoepcke) January 4, 2019German Justice Minister Katarina Barley told the BBC: \u201cThe people behind this want to damage confidence in our democracy and institutions.\u201d\u201cFor a country that holds individual privacy so dearly and has some of the region\u2019s strictest data protection laws this is a very damaging attack, not least for the German government\u2019s credibility to secure itself,\u201d said Matt Walmsley, head of EMEA Marketing at Vectra, via email.Germany\u2019s intelligence agencies have met to coordinate a response \u2013 and so far, no one knows who\u2019s behind the attack or where the data was siphoned from \u2013 only that the Twitter account was registered to a user claiming to be in Hamburg. Internal government networks have not been breached, according to Germany\u2019s federal office for information security (BSI).Walmsley had some theories, however. \u201cInitial reports say that members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party hasn\u2019t been affected so there may be a political motivation in this attack,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t disregard the work of foreign state actors here either, particularly Russia who have been cited in multiple attacks and cyber-interference on foreign powers, and in 2015 were accused by the German domestic security services of hacking the German parliament. Germany\u2019s BSI information security agency was also tipped off by America last month that China was targeting the country with \u2018cloud hopper\u2019 attacks.\u201dBreachGovernmentHacksPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Nearly half (46 percent) of executives in a Deloitte poll say their organizations have experienced a cybersecurity incident over the past year \u2014 and that they\u2019re still no closer to being ready for the next event.The survey, of more than 3,150 professionals taken during a Deloitte Dbriefs webcast on cyber-preparedness, found that a lack of organizational policy awareness when it comes to cybersecurity is hampering efforts to improve incident response benchmarks.To wit: About a third (30 percent) of CEO and executive-level respondents identified a lack of employee understanding of the organization\u2019s cyber-incident response plan as their biggest challenge when it comes to dealing with an attack.Another fifth (20 percent) reported a lack of resources, such as funding, tools and skills, as the biggest obstacle.The result is that more than 1,500 of the surveyed professionals reported feeling only \u201csomewhat confident\u201d in their organization\u2019s ability to respond to and remediate a cyber-incident. It\u2019s not positive news given that Deloitte estimates cybercrime costs to reach $6 trillion annually, amidst no indication of a slowdown in cyber-threats.\u201cWe used to say it\u2019s \u2018not if, but when\u2019 an organization will experience a cyber-incident, said Andrew Morrison, principal, Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory Cyber Risk Services, Deloitte & Touche LLP. \u201cThat message has evolved well beyond a single incident to \u2018how often\u2019 or \u2018how to respond to and withstand persistent attacks.\u201dUnfortunately, about half (49 percent) of executive and C-level respondents to the poll admitted that their organization does not conduct cyber-wargaming exercises, and more than one-third (34 percent) indicated that they don\u2019t know their individual role within their organization\u2019s cyber-incident response plan.The findings dovetail with Deloitte\u2019s recently released CEO and Board Risk Management Survey, which identified cybersecurity as the biggest threat to organizations \u2014and yet only 25 percent of the 400 CEOs and board members surveyed said their organizations are actively wargaming or scenario planning for cyber-incidents.A typical wargame allows participants to hone organizational reflexes and collaborative judgment capabilities required to avert or reduce a cyber incident crisis with real-time injects and threat vectors that mirror those an organization would likely encounter. Deloitte noted that best practices include focusing on learning objectives to understand what an organization needs at its current level of maturity; involving a broad group of participants to identify intersections between different teams and siloes; and identifying a realistic scenario with realistic vulnerabilities.\u201cImproving internal processes and providing employees with the knowledge, practice and skills needed to succeed can help organizations mitigate risk through preparedness, as well as increase overall business resilience to future attacks,\u201d Morrison said.HacksMalwareMost Recent ThreatListsWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Top U.S. universities are among the worst in the world at protecting users from email fraud, lacking security measures to prevent common threat tactics such as domain spoofing or other types of fraudulent emails, researchers have found.Ninety-seven percent of the top 10 universities in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are subjecting students, staff and administration to higher risks of email-based impersonation and other attacks because their systems lack basic security, according to new research from Proofpoint revealed Tuesday. Moreover, U.S. institutions are the worst offenders of the bunch, with some of the poorest levels of cybersecurity protection, researchers found.The news is troubling, especially as email remains the most common vector for security compromises across all industries, observed Ryan Kalember, executive vice president of cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint, in a statement. Further, the frequency, sophistication, and cost of cyber attacks against universities has increased over the last years, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s the combination of these factors that make it especially concerning that the premier universities in the U.S. are currently the most vulnerable to attack,\u201d Kalember noted.Indeed, universities and other institutions of higher education store \u201cmasses of sensitive personal and financial data, perhaps more so than any industry outside healthcare,\u201d he said. This, unfortunately, makes them a top target for cybercriminals, who currently have an easy path to attack due to lack of email protections, he said.Lacking in Email ProtectionAmong universities in the United States, Proofpoint looked at Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Stanford universities, the Universities of California Berkeley and Los Angeles, the University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and New York University.Researchers used Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) analysis of these universities as well as the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Australia to make their assessment.DMARC\u00a0is an email validation protocol aimed at protecting domain names from being misused by cybercriminals by authenticating the sender\u2019s identity before sending a message to its intended destination, researchers noted. This misuse can occur in cybercriminals impersonating an authentic entity by what\u2019s called \u201cspoofing\u201d its domain, which leads a recipient of an email to think it\u2019s legitimate when it\u2019s not.DMARC has three levels of protection: monitor, quarantine and reject; the last is the most secure for preventing suspicious emails from reaching the inbox. Proofpoint found that none of the top U.S. and U.K. universities had a Reject policy in place that can actively block malicious emails from reaching their targets, leaving users of their email systems wide-open to email fraud.While 65 percent of the top U.S. and U.K. universities\u2014or 13 out of 20\u2013did have a base level of DMARC protection to either monitor or quarantine emails, five of the top 10 U.S. universities did not publish any level of DMARC record, researchers found.More specifically, 11 out of the 20 institutions investigated in the United States and United Kingdom have a Monitor policy in place, while only 2 have a Quarantine policy in place, they said. Across all the 30 universities observed, 17 of them (57 percent) implemented at least a Monitor policy, while four of them (13 percent) had at least a Quarantine policy, according to Proofpoint.\u00a0Universities in the CrosshairsEducational facilities have never been at the cutting edge of security, and new protocols such as remote classes held over the Zoom video platform and others put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic have only exacerbated the situation.Indeed, with this new shift to remote learning and a hybrid model of in-person and online courses going forward, cyberattacks against universities will continue to climb, researchers said. Exploiting human error through socially engineered malicious emails is low-hanging fruit for cybercriminals, especially when there is no barrier to block these suspicious emails from reaching inbox of unsuspecting victims, according to Proofpoint.Moreover, email is often a gateway for more dangerous attacks. One type of attack that can initiate as an email-related breach is ransomware, which has become a major thorn in the side of universities in recent years. In fact, one 157-year-old college\u2013Illinois-based Lincoln College\u2013even closed its doors recently due to a combination of pressures from the pandemic and a ransomware attack that pushed it to its breaking point.One major issue that Proofpoint uncovered in its recent Voice of the CISO report is that CIOs in the education sector are feeling neglected by their respective organizations, without the support to implement security protections that could block the institutions from common threats, such as malicious emails, Kalember noted.Without this support going forward\u2014and without employing DMARC protections that can block malicious emails before they even reach a person\u2019s inbox\u2014users will continue to get exposed to threats that can easily be avoided, he said.\u201cPeople are a critical line of defense against email fraud but remain one of the biggest vulnerabilities for organizations,\u201d Kalember said. \u201cWhen fully compliant with DMARC, a malicious email can\u2019t reach your inbox, removing the risk of human interference.\u201dVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

Source: Conti blog.Cyberattacks Coming at and From RussiaThe split-Conti story is just one of a myriad of cybersecurity headlines coming out of the siege of Ukraine. Some other events in the cyberwar that are rocking the security world:Russia appears to deploy digital defenses after DDoS attacks\u00a0Anonymous Declares \u2018Cyberwar\u2019 on Russia and Pledges Support for Ukraine\u00a0Anonymous breached the internal network of Belarusian railways\u00a0Ukraine: Volunteer IT Army is going to hit tens of Russian targets from this list\u00a0Richard Fleeman, vice president of penetration testing ops at cybersecurity advisory services provider Coalfire, told Threatpost on Monday that collective groups such as Anonymous claim to be hacktivists, meaning they don\u2019t attack for personal gain, but rather that they seek to spread their ideology and wage cyberwarfare against those that don\u2019t\u00a0 align.\u00a0\u201cThese kinds of activities ebb and flow based on geopolitical events or collective objectives of these groups,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t new, but they\u2019ll likely escalate \u201camidst the global chaos to target various countries, government agencies, and corporations.\u201d\u201cThese groups thrive on sentiment and will likely continue to build momentum based on their objectives,\u201d Fleeman observed.\u00a0The muddle of war can also obscure false flag or false information campaigns that target, influence or mislead others, he said. \u201cThis can be accomplished in a variety of ways, for example, China compromising Russian technology and targeting other nations through the compromised infrastructure to hide the origins of their attacks or embedding Russian language or terms into source code of malware would aid in the hiding [of] the true origin.\u201dHe urged that situational awareness be elevated and that security teams \u201cbe vigilant, remain alert, and leverage their security mechanisms in place to identify threats and mitigate them in a fluid manner.\u201dThe Lure of War to Cyber Actors\u00a0Casey Ellis, founder and CTO at crowdsourced cybersecurity provider Bugcrowd, told Threatpost on Monday that the bloodless nature of cyber combat makes it tough to predict who\u2019ll enter this conflict and how.\u00a0\u201cThe fact that a lot of unrelated but concerned actors have entered the conflict is unsurprising,\u201d he noted via email. \u201cAnonymous, for example, is well-known for having a principled position on topics and then acting or retaliating via the Internet.\u201dHis primary concern: \u201cthe relative difficulty of attribution in cyberattacks, as well as the possibility of incorrect attribution or even an intentional false flag operation escalating the conflict internationally.\u201dRussia will likely avoid provoking the United States \u201cuntil it\u2019s tactically or strategically advantageous for them to do so, which we all hope we can avoid,\u201d he noted. Last week, the White House denied considering plans to launch massive cyberattacks against Russia in order to cut off its ability to pursue its military aggression \u2013\u00a0denials made in spite of NBC News quoting multiple sources to the contrary.\u00a0\u201cHaving said that, the backdrop of conflict and the openness of the Internet provide greater than normal levels of'\u201daircover\u2019 and background noise for cybercriminals, as well as other nation-states looking to plant a false flag,\u201d Ellis said.John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at digital IT and security operations company Netenrich, told Threatpost via email that it\u2019s the wild west out there: Traditional actors are using sabotage and DDoS related to military objectives, he observed, while others \u201cwill use the fog of war (quite literally) to take advantage. No one has to commit front line infantry if they want to take advantage anymore,\u201d he said.Expect a pig pile, he predicted: \u201cUsually for conflicts in that region, other non-state regional actors will engage, either due to patriotism or opportunism. Now that more nations are developing this capability, more are coming to play. And there is no better training ground for nation-state actors than playing in an active warzone.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0What does that mean for security teams in the United States and other western countries?\u00a0 It depends on what the West does, he said. \u201cIf we get involved militarily, then the scope of attacks will increase to those nations as well. If it is targeted sanctions, likely attacks will focus on those in the chain of enforcement.\u201d\u00a0GovernmentHacksMalwareWeb Security",

A.I.G., also known as Atlantis Cyber-Army, functions as a cyber-threats-as-a-service criminal enterprise. The threat group markets services that include data leaks, distributed denial of service (DDoS), remote desktop protocol (RDP) hijacking and additional network penetration services, according to a Thursday report by threat intelligence firm Cyberint.\u201c[A.I.G.] has introduced us to out-of-the-box thinking,\u201d Cyberint\u2019s Shmuel Gihon wrote in the report.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office. WATCH HERE.]A.I.G., according to researchers, is unique in its outsourcing approach to committing cybercrimes. Organized threat groups tend to recruit individuals with certain capabilities that they can reuse and incent them with profit sharing. For example, Ransomware-as-a-Service organized crime campaigns can involve multiple threat actors \u2013 each getting a cut of any extorted lucre or digital assets stolen. What makes A.I.G. different is it outsources specific aspects of an attack to \u201cmercenaries\u201d who have no further involvement in an attack.The report\u2019s author, Gihon, said only A.I.G. administrators and the group\u2019s leader\u2014dubbed Mr. Eagle\u2014know fully what the campaign will be and outsource isolated tasks to hired guns based on their skillsets.Unique Business ModelThis uncommon business model also allows the group, which has been operating since the beginning of May, to offer a range of cybercriminal services instead of a single core competency, he said.\u201cWhile many groups are focusing on one, maybe two, services that they offer, Atlas seems to grow rapidly and expand its operations in an efficient way which allows them to offer many services,\u201d Gihon wrote.A.I.G. tends to target government and state assets in countries all over the world, including the United States, Pakistan, Israel, Colombia and United Arab Emirates, researchers found.Mr. Eagle not only leads the campaigns but also doubles as a chief marketing officer of sorts, putting a significant effort into advertising A.I.G.\u2019s various cybercriminal services, he said.Anatomy of a Threat GroupResearchers took a deep dive into how A.I.G. operates, communicates and manages its operations, as well observed the specific cybercriminal services it offers.DDoS seems to be the group specialty, with Atlas providing solid proof of execution to customers for as little as 20 euros per victim, researchers said. The group also offers a popular data-leak services that focuses on anything that might be valuable to potential buyers, Gihon said.A.I.G. has published leaked databases from all over the world for sale, with a starting price from 15 euros, researchers said. The group targeted various sectors in the breaches, including education, finance, government entities, manufacturing and technology, they said.A.I.G. also has premium services that demand more skill and demonstrate the group\u2019s sophistication, researchers said. One of these products is hacked panels and initial access to organizations, with prices for these services starting from about $1,000.The group also offers \u201cVIP services\u201d that claim ties to people in law-enforcement positions across Europe that can give customers access to sensitive information about specific individuals, researchers said.Multi-Channel CommunicationTelegram is the communication platform of choice for A.I.G., with the group operating three different Telegram channels with thousands of subscribers, researchers said. One is a database marketplace for selling leaked databases, and another is a commercial channel that also includes announcements and updates from the group, they said.Atlas also operates a unique Telegram channel in which Mr. Eagle and the group\u2019s administrators publish the contracts that the group offers to those hired to perform attacks. This allows subscribers to sign up depending on what they can offer and helps the group recruit various cybercriminals, such as red teamers, social engineers and malware developers, researchers said.Atlas sells its services primarily on an e-commerce store on the site Sellix.io, a forum that offers payment with cryptocurrency and acts as a broker, providing the privacy-conscious group with an extra layer of anonymity, Gihon said.\u201cObserving the behavior of the group in general and the leader in particular, it seems that operation security (OpSec) is a top priority,\u201d he wrote.The (Mr.) Eagle Has LandedIndeed, the group\u2019s leader is an enigmatic figure who appears to run a tight ship in terms of his overall maturity and professionalism, exhibiting logical and meticulous decision-making and behavior that leaves \u201cno room for errors,\u201d Gihon wrote.\u201cMr.Eagle tends to have very strict rules in the management of the group, including banning and throwing [out] scammers and other threat actors that try to advertise their products,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt seems that Mr.Eagle maintains very high reliability among the group.\u201dThis type of leadership apparently comes in handy when delegating tasks to general administrators, of which A.I.G. appears to have at least four\u2014dubbed El Rojo, Mr.Shawji, S41T4M4 and Coffee, researchers said. The administrators carry out day-to-day advertising tasks as well as management of group operations and communication channels, researchers said.\\The hired contractors, or \u201cmercenaries,\u201d who carry out the nefarious activities of the group are the lowest rung of the A.I.G. structural ladder. This part of the group is a revolving door of cybercriminals who are hired to work only on a particular campaign based on their skillset, researchers said.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office.

In fact, insurance clients opting for cyber coverage rose from 26 percent in 2016 to 47 percent in 2020, according to reporting by the U.S. Government Accounting Office (GAO).Given the current conflict in Ukraine, the insurance industry is facing increased pressure and concerns that a spike in attacks will lead to a surge in claims. While it\u2019s undeniable that nation-state threat actors have stepped up their game to capitalize on the chaos brought on by the Ukraine-Russia conflict, cyber insurance is not the answer to the growing threat.Rethinking Cyber InsuranceWhen cyber insurance entered the scene in the late 1990s, the restrictions were few and the coverage generous, but that trend has shifted in recent years. There is a strong tendency across industries to approach a problem differently as soon as we put the word \u201ccyber\u201d in front of it. Treating \u201ccyber\u201d as different and in some ways wholly detached from traditional fraud obfuscates the fundamentals.Aspects of the insurance industry initially fell into that trap. However, we\u2019re now seeing a shift back to traditional risk measurement, with underwriters approaching cyber insurance in a manner similar to physical insurance \u2013 by assessing where the biggest risks are and determining whether they should exclude certain risks from coverage, as well as establishing a bar to define what constitutes reasonable care. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing coverage premiums skyrocket. By the end of 2020, more than half of cyber insurance policy holders saw the price of their coverage rise by as much as 30 percent, according to GAO.While the current conflict in Ukraine will likely lead to a rise in cyber insurance purchases, the harsh reality is that most coverage will not protect enterprises from nation-state attacks or even ransomware. In fact, most cyber insurance policies already include clauses to exclude acts of war, and in the aftermath of the current struggle, we\u2019ll likely see further refinement of language and an expansion in the number of coverage exclusions as insurers look to hedge their risks. With insurance companies tightening their purses and attackers doubling down their efforts, what\u2019s the answer for organizations looking to mitigate risk?Mitigate Risks, Not ThreatsThe bottom line is that if you\u2019re buying cyber insurance only because you expect to experience a cyberattack and are unsure whether you have adequate controls in place or the right planning around disaster recovery, you aren\u2019t investing as you should be. The first step before buying a cyber insurance policy should be a risk assessment.You can\u2019t do the math on whether insurance is worth the cost without determining the anticipated impact of a cyber incident \u2013 and math requires numbers, which means risk needs to be clearly quantified. An in-depth analytical approach is likely to be the standard moving forward, with insurers themselves completing assessments to determine if they would agree to underwrite a policy.When Insurance Makes Most SenseThat said, insurance is an important component of risk management. Where a risk might be high impact but low probability that it will happen, insurance makes sense. Intertwine that with the cost of mitigating the risk versus the likelihood that it will happen, and you\u2019ll find high mitigation costs with low likelihood make insurance a smart decision.For many organizations, there are basic steps they should take to shore up their security \u2013 the standard duty of care \u2013 which must be addressed. If a risk assessment reveals glaring holes in your security stack, it\u2019s time to get back to basics and improve cyber hygiene. Given that many IT departments are understaffed and under-resourced, it\u2019s important to automate risk monitoring wherever possible to quickly identify and remediate threats continuously and in real-time.But deploying more point solutions across your organization won\u2019t get the job done unless you can see and control all that technology whenever and wherever. Consider consolidating your security tools where possible to increase visibility across your entire IT estate. Once you have undertaken a thorough risk assessment, established a strong security foundation, and conducted a clear cost-benefit analysis \u2013 which requires open communication from the CISO to the CFO and even the board \u2013 only then should you consider investing in cyber insurance.Cyber Insurance Fine PrintAs the Russia-Ukraine war wages on and other nation-states and criminals exploit the chaos, we\u2019ll likely continue to see the interest in cyber insurance grow, but I\u2019d wager the companies signing up for policies will be the ones who fail to read the fine print.Just as we saw a clarification of cyber insurance policies in the wake of NotPetya, the future will usher in more review and rewriting of exclusion clauses. With insurers unlikely to pay out when it comes to ransomware attacks in times of war, organizations must focus instead on proactive cyber hygiene.Just as you can generally avoid a car accident if you maintain your car and drive safely \u2013 by getting a clear picture of your risk and taking steps to address it, you can mitigate the likelihood of a devastating cyberattack. After all, the best insurance against a cyberattack is not a policy, but a strong security foundation.Infosec Insiders columnist Chris Hallenbeck is CISO for the Americas at Tanium.

        "raw text": "The one-two punch of a cyberattack can be devastating. There is the breach and then the related mitigation costs. Implementing a comprehensive Incident Response (IR) gameplan into a worst-case-scenario should not be a post-breach scramble. And when that IR strategy includes insurance, it also must address a business\u2019s level of cyber risk.A 2021 study by NetDiligence analyzed over 5,700 claims and the average claim cost for an organization with less than $2 billion in revenue was $354,000. Larger organizations incurred on average over $16 million in costs.The cost issue is compounded when ransom payments are included in the calculation, which can significantly increase insurance claim payouts. Unsurprisingly, this trend has led many cyber liability insurance carriers, as well as law firms who specialize in data breach, to encourage their clients to strengthen their cybersecurity controls and seek more formal relationships with digital forensics and incident response firms.For most, an IR retainer will be a formal relationship to safeguard the organization if the worst was to happen. It grants firms expedited response under a pre-agreed service level agreement (SLA) and avoids potential delays around legal and financial decisions when every minute counts. It is incredibly valuable in a crisis but offers limited value when the organization manages to avoid incidents.IR Retainers Shouldn\u2019t Just Be Another Insurance Policy While the majority of organizations do treat the \u201chardening\u201d of their controls and the search for an IR retainer as separate projects, the biggest value would come from achieving both under a true \u201ccyber risk\u201d retainer. Pure IR retainers typically don\u2019t offer security leaders flexibility to maximize their investment, but by being permitted to use credits toward preparedness, testing, simulations and so forth, cyber risk can be mitigated. There are three key elements to achieving an effective cyber risk retainer: negotiation, structure and\u00a0 executionOne: Negotiate with TransparencyIdentify a firm with experience beyond IR. Are they familiar with incident preparedness needs, such as tabletop exercises, breach and attack simulations, red team exercises, etc?If gaps in your essential security controls (e.g. MFA, backups, email hygiene) are identified, would this firm have the capability to assist? If an incident leads to a breach of sensitive data, would this firm be able to help with breach notification needs? Would retainer credits cover the costs?Once you identify an initial set of firms that can satisfy these criteria, it\u2019s helpful to ask what sort of onboarding is needed. Experienced firms will run a thorough process of learning about the client\u2019s IT security program, including what policies and plans they have, as well as to gain an overview of their IT environment. This leads us to step #2, where the fun starts with structuring retainers based on key requirements.Two: Structure Retainers According to Your Security StrategyRetainer structuring begins with mapping out the most effective allocation of retainer credits.A cost estimate should be given for common IR scenarios (ransomware and Business Email Compromise, for example) and that becomes a set percentage of the retainer.The remaining retainer allocation should be mapped to your security strategy. Perhaps the organization is moving to the cloud and will need to deploy MFA to the Azure active directory, for example. A portion of the retainer could be set aside for penetration testing that can identify MFA weaknesses. Simulations and tabletop exercises that are specific to the industry and / or risk appetite should also be conducted to ensure everyone from executives, PR to compliance teams are prepared should the worst happen.Three: Execute with Guidance from Your Retainer PartnerThe best cyber risk retainers are collaborative exercises. Keeping in constant contact with the retainer team can provide you with frontline threat intelligence and analysis of complex security issues being faced by organizations like yours. This ensures that investment is also well targeted to areas of potential vulnerability utilized by today\u2019s threat actors.With most infosec teams critically understaffed, those in your retainer team can become a valuable resource for advising on and prioritizing key cyber resilience issues.In helping firms to become more secure, retainer teams often also take on the role of project manager. They are in a good position to bring stakeholders to the table, prepare necessary communications and seek appropriate technical permissions.By encouraging firms to use their excess retainer credits for proactive services overall cyber resilience will be enhanced. More vulnerabilities, gaps in security policies, processes and technology will be identified. Organizations can do risk assessments, penetration tests and tabletop exercises, ensuring that security is not only improved but the wider business is assured of its maturity.An additional benefit of a longer-term retainer relationship is that the cyber practitioners are afforded the opportunity to learn about a client\u2019s cybersecurity program and the context in which it exists. Knowing the various policies and processes in place, the toolsets that are deployed, along with the configurations in their network can become vital contextual intelligence. With this in-depth knowledge, if a client suffers a cyberattack its on-hand practitioners will already have a solid understanding of the client\u2019s IT environment which will allow them to expeditiously contain and remediate the issue.In an ideal world incident preparedness and response should be tightly intertwined. True cyber risk retainers allow organizations to do this in a way that not only improves resilience in theory, but equips teams with the practical intelligence to do the very best job they can, both in a crisis and business-as-usual environment.InfoSec Insider",

        "raw text": "The pandemic has fast-tracked migration to the public cloud, including Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Platform and Microsoft Azure. But the journey hasn\u2019t exactly been smooth as silk: The great migration has brought a raft of complex security challenges, which have led to headline-grabbing data exposures and more. Misconfigurations and a lack of visibility into cloud assets and inventory are the biggest culprits for public-cloud insecurity. Thankfully, there are approaches that can help.When it comes to enabling a new at-home workforce, moving to the cloud fits the bill. Public-cloud services also offer agility and scalability, allowing businesses to quickly spin up new users and instances as needed. And for some entities, the cloud can offer cost savings vs. having to maintain their own physical infrastructure.It\u2019s no wonder that Gartner predicted in August 2021 that public-cloud spending will exceed 45 percent of all enterprise IT spending by 2026, up from just less than 17 percent in 2021.\u201cEven absent the pandemic there would still be a loss of appetite for [on-prem] data centers,\u201d said Sid Nag, research vice president at Gartner. \u201cEmerging technologies such as containerization, virtualization and edge computing are becoming more mainstream and driving additional cloud spending. Simply put, the pandemic served as a multiplier for CIOs\u2019 interest in the cloud.\u201dHowever, as with any major sea change, this transition has caused a certain amount of confusion and scrambling on the part of some stakeholders, including, crucially, IT security staff.graffiti sick cloud icon sprayed in black over whiteIn a September 2021 report from the nonprofit Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), nearly 70 percent of respondents \u2013 comprising 1,090 IT and security professionals \u2013 reported that their company\u2019s cloud security, IT operations and developer teams are misaligned on security policies and/or enforcement strategies.Migration is \u201ca non-trivial thing to do,\u201d said Prevailion CTO Nate Warfield, and it \u201ctakes lots of planning to do it.\u201d After all, it\u2019s a seismic shift from the traditional work done by security and infrastructure teams, which are often far more accustomed to their traditional on-prem tasks \u2013 think racking a server, for example.\u201cWith COVID, a lot of that planning got compressed,\u201d Warfield observed, with organizations forced to make the move \u201cfar faster than they would have wanted to.\u201dThat means that security has lagged, as IT security teams rush to get up to speed on cloud security, and all of the new challenges that it brings.Cloud Blind SpotsThere are indeed many challenges, because there are multiple factors that complicate the deployment and maintenance of highly secure cloud environments. Some of the most common concerns and risks that scrambling IT security teams have run into include:Insufficient staff skillsData loss/leakageAPI vulnerabilitiesMalware infectionsInsufficient identity and access management controlsLack of visibility into what data and workloads are within cloud applicationsInability to monitor data in transit to and from cloud applicationsCloud applications being provisioned outside of IT visibility (e.g., shadow IT)Inability to prevent malicious insider theft or misuse of dataAdvanced threats and attacks against the cloud application providerInability to assess the security of the cloud application provider\u2019s operationsVendors failing to alert customers of vulnerabilitiesInability to maintain regulatory complianceMisconfigurations of cloud hardware and/or cloud softwareMisconfigurationsThe lack of planning in the rush to the cloud has led to simple mistakes that trigger serious security catastrophes. According to the 2020 Cloud Threat Report from Oracle and KPMG, a full 51 percent of organizations reported that misconfigurations have led to compromise and exposure of sensitive data.Such misconfigurations include the unwitting exposure of unencrypted data to the public internet without any required authentication, granting public access to storage buckets, improper creation of network functionality, allowing all system users access to exposed cloud-stored data, and storing encryption passwords and keys in open repositories, among other issues.These kinds of oversights are to blame for a rash of headline-grabbing data exposures, including:November 2021: The leak of more than 1 million users\u2019 data due to a misconfiguration of Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (ELK) stack security at the hands of the free VPN service Quickfox.March 2021: The arts-and-crafts retailer Hobby Lobby left 138GB of sensitive customer information, source code for the company\u2019s app, and employee names and email addresses open to the public internet because of a cloud misconfiguration in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud database.December 2019: vpnMentor discovered a breached database that leaked over 500,000 highly sensitive and private legal and financial documents. The database belonged to two financial technology companies \u2013 Advantage Capital Funding and Argus Capital Funding \u2013 that were storing it in an AWS S3 bucket without basic security measures such as encryption, authentication or access credentials.In fact, in 2020, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) concluded that misconfiguration of cloud resources was the most common cloud cyberrisk. It\u2019s the easiest vulnerability for attackers to exploit in order to gain unauthorized access to cloud data and services, with possible outcomes ranging from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and malware installation to account compromise and data exposure, the agency said.The aforementioned CSA report backs up the NSA\u2019s findings: More than one in six companies \u2013 17 percent \u2013 reported that they experienced a public-cloud security breach or incident due to a cloud misconfiguration in the preceding year.In the infamous July 2019 Capital One breach, more than 106 million customers\u2019 data were compromised by an attacker who exploited a server misconfiguration in AWS (suspected to be an AWS engineer). The following October, some senators alleged that Amazon was at least partly to blame.And when the subject of blame comes up, so too does the sharedresponsibility model for the public cloud and the confusion over who, exactly, is responsible for what.Shared ResponsibilityAs the NSA has explained in the past, public-cloud service providers often provide tools to help manage cloud configuration, and yet misconfiguration on the part of end customers \u201cremains the most prevalent cloud vulnerability and can be exploited to access cloud data and services.\u201dThose misconfigurations often come out of a misunderstanding of sharedresponsibility models, according to the NSA.According to Oliver Tavakoli, CTO at AI cybersecurity threat detection and response firm Vectra AI, the migration to public clouds such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure has brought these notions of shared responsibility, as it relates to the security and compliance of the overall solution, to the fore.AWS\u2019s infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) model and Microsoft\u2019s platform-as-a-service (PaaS) Azure model both try to communicate the principle that \u201cwe take care of the basics, while you take care of what\u2019s under your control,\u201d Tavakoli said.He added, \u201cIn other words, AWS will ensure that S3 buckets can only be accessed consistent with the policy governing their use \u2013 but it is the customer\u2019s responsibility to set a policy appropriate to the data stored there. Or, when delivering PaaS services on Azure, Microsoft\u2019s responsibility is to ensure that the OS used to deliver the service is patched and hardened.\u201dThus, public-cloud providers aren\u2019t generally considered on the hook for users leaving their storage buckets open to the internet without authentication, for instance. But, Tavakoli noted that their dealings with vulnerabilities show that providers\u2019 portion of shared responsibility can actually complicate customers\u2019 security postures.A bug handled well: In February 2019, public-cloud customers benefited from the shared-responsibility model when all CSPs patched a container-escape vulnerability, CVE-2019-5736, that could have granted attackers access to the contents of the underlying OS and any virtual machines (VMs) running under the same hypervisor. In contrast, organizations that ran containers in their own data centers were on their own, having to rush to patch their container OS images.Bugs gone bad: In August 2021, a vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Azure Cosmos DB, the scalable, multitenant NoSQL database, was disclosed that could allow an attacker on one cloud account to tamper with data in other customers\u2019 cloud instances. It was found to only affect customers who had the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB enabled. But as (bad) luck would have it, that feature was automatically enabled for all Cosmos DBs created after February 2021. Thus, customers who didn\u2019t even use the feature were exposed.\u201cIt highlights the fact that just because a company isn\u2019t actively using a particular feature (Jupyter Notebooks), that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not exposed to vulnerabilities within that feature,\u201d Tavakoli noted.As Prevailion\u2019s Warfield explained, another part of the problem with shared responsibility is that \u201ccloud providers don\u2019t take a proactive stance towards breach/compromise monitoring.\u201dWhy CSPs Won\u2019t Necessarily Call When They Spot ProblemsIn many cases, public-cloud providers \u201cwon\u2019t even pass on notifications to their customers [when] they have received [notifications] from external researchers,\u201d Warfield said. But it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care about security, he said, pointing to Microsoft\u2019s \u201cwell-developed process to secure its hypervisor layer.\u201dInstead, \u201cdue to the nature of providing IaaS/PaaS/SaaS solutions, a large amount of the work is left to the customer,\u201d he noted. Warfield knows the scenario first-hand from working with Microsoft: He was a senior security researcher for Windows Defender ATP up until March 2021.\u201cI\u2019m sure there are liability issues involved,\u201d he said. \u201cLawyers would have logical reasons why Microsoft won\u2019t tweak settings on [a customer\u2019s] machine. [Customers] might have good reasons for their settings.\u201dBut besides potential legal ramifications, the big cloud providers \u201caren\u2019t staffed for it anyway,\u201d Warfield said. Imagine this hypothetical: 12,000 customers are compromised by, say, overly permissive firewalls. The response that Warfield would expect to hear from Microsoft, he conjectured, is that \u201cwe don\u2019t have the capacity to handle it if they all call support,\u201d he said.At Prevailion, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re constantly seeing people breached.\u201d To professionals like Warfield, security problems such as misconfigurations or lack of visibility are \u201csomewhat frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t new problems. We were getting close to solving them before networks showed up, with firewalls, for example. [Then came the] rush to the cloud, and now we\u2019re seeing circa-1997 problems. It\u2019s a 20-year-old problem in a 2-year-old technology.\u201dLack of VisibilityAnother top blind spot in cloud security is lack of visibility, whether it\u2019s knowing exactly what data and workloads are in an organization\u2019s public cloud accounts or which cloud applications are being provisioned outside of IT teams\u2019 visibility (e.g., shadow IT).Shadow IT is the term for data being housed in unsanctioned IT resources \u2013 i.e., employees using a cloud application to do their work that wasn\u2019t provided by the company. It\u2019s nothing new: Employees have long gone behind the backs of their organizations\u2019 IT departments in a quest to find easier ways to get their jobs done, to innovate and to boost their productivity. But the problem is that IT security guardians can\u2019t see shadow IT, manage it, secure it, or figure out when to permit or forbid its use.According to industry analyst firm Gartner, as many as one-third of successful attacks on enterprises target these untracked, invisible-to-IT resources, many times due to poor password hygiene. According to Verizon\u2019s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report, over 80 percent of data and privacy breaches are due to poor password practices.But 1Password CEO Jeff Shiner also explained what can happen if, say, workers are using two popular cloud services: Airtable \u2013 a cloud collaboration service that offers the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet \u2013 and the grammar-checking service Grammarly: \u201cSay Carlos populates Airtable with customer data for his email campaigns, and Anita checks sensitive legal documents in Grammarly. Without thinking about it, they\u2019re sharing a lot of important data with external companies that IT doesn\u2019t even know about,\u201d Shiner suggested.Gaining visibility into an organization\u2019s data, workload and apps can help to \u201cstart clarifying your thinking,\u201d said Eric Kaiser, senior security engineer at the cloud-native security analytics platform Uptycs. \u201cIt brings up the kind of questions you need to ask regardless of the environment,\u201d such as \u201cwhat does normal look like?\u201d\u201cEspecially with instances turning on or off, especially in a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are the things in AWS and on servers that I have to care about?\u201dThe Road AheadAs we\u2019ve seen, misconfigurations, data breaches and myriad other cloud pitfalls have pockmarked businesses\u2019 journey to the cloud. However, the cloudsec road ahead doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be as jarring as it\u2019s been so far.For example, increasingly, there are freely available open-source tools that can help.Kaiser noted that it\u2019s possible to create deep visibility into cloud security by using CloudQuery, an open-source cloud asset inventory tool powered by SQL that enables assessment, auditing and evaluation of the configurations of cloud assets. It\u2019s built on the principles of OSquery: a tool that similarly uses basic SQL commands that let users query their endpoint devices like a database.To put it into concrete terms, tools like CloudQuery can paint a vivid landscape of the security environment to solve for a range of security issues, such as:Frequency analysis: What apps are being run by only one person? Who is that one person? What\u2019s their need? Conversely, is the only user an autoclicker, which automates a mouse clicking on a computer screen?User-behavior analytics: Users generate millions of network events every day. Using tools to perform analytics on their behavior can enable detection of compromised credentials, lateral movement and other malicious behavior. By uncovering patterns and insight, IT teams can identify evidence of intruder compromise, insider threats and risky behavior on the network.Discovery: Visibility tools can give users insights into what, exactly, they\u2019re running on the cloud: services that they might not even be aware they were running \u201cuntil they got the bill,\u201d Kaiser said. Such tools can also discover data that users weren\u2019t sure that they were responsible for, including things that developers turned on for what should have been brief, task-related purposes, like those autoclickers.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The headlines feel like Groundhog Day, if each of Bill Murray\u2019s repeated days grew increasingly threatening:Ransomware attacks rise again.\nRansomware attacks up over last quarter.\nRansomware attacks tower over previous year.You get the idea. And yet again, a new report from Ivanti sends a clear warning: It\u2019s still getting worse. The Ransomware Spotlight Year-End Report identified 32 new ransomware families in 2021, bringing the total to 157 and representing a 26 percent increase over the previous year. These ransomware families are exploiting a total of 288 vulnerabilities \u2013 a 29 percent increase over the previous year. The report was conducted in partnership between Ivanti, Cyber Security Works and Cyware, and based on proprietary data, publicly available threat databases, and threat researchers and penetration-testing teams.The report found that these ransomware groups are continuing to target unpatched vulnerabilities and weaponize zero-day vulnerabilities in record time to instigate crippling attacks. At the same time, threat actors are broadening their attack spheres and finding newer ways to compromise organizational networks and fearlessly trigger high-impact assaults.And according to Coveware, organizations pay an average of $220,298 and suffer 23 days of downtime following a ransomware attack. That\u2019s devastating in an optimal climate, and given the scramble to shift to the digital landscape combined with unprecedented shortages of skilled IT labor, an attack could be insurmountable.It\u2019s Time to MAP Your Cybersecurity JourneyThe good news: while ransomware threats are increasing in sophistication, so are countermeasures. There are things you can do to dramatically reduce your attack surface and proactively protect against and/or remediate threats without further exhausting your human resources.To build a comprehensive, scalable and framework-aligned cybersecurity strategy for the Everywhere Workplace, companies must go on a three-phased journey: Manage, Automate and Prioritize (MAP). Manage, the first phase, is about establishing your cybersecurity foundation. Automate is about alleviating the burden on IT. Prioritize is about getting to a state where IT has the information and ability to identify and address the top risk areas.There are six steps to a comprehensive MAP strategy, and you can get started right now:Step 1: Get Complete Asset VisibilityYou can\u2019t manage and secure what you can\u2019t find. Invest in an automated platform that enhances visibility into all connected devices and software and provides context into how those assets are being used, so your IT and security teams can make better decisions. A comprehensive discovery initiative finds all assets on a network, including both corporate-owned and BYOD devices, and then provides context around who is using what device, how and when they\u2019re using that device, and what they have access to. This enables security teams to better keep assets protected and improve overall security posture.Step 2: Modernize Device ManagementModern device management is an essential part of increasing security in remote and hybrid work environments. A unified endpoint management (UEM) approach fully supports bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives while maximizing user privacy and securing corporate data at the same time.UEM architectures usually include the ability to easily onboard and configure device and application settings at scale, establish device hygiene with risk-based patch management and mobile threat protection, monitor device posture and ensure compliance, identify and remediate issues quickly and remotely, automate software updates and OS deployments, and more. Choose a UEM solution with management capabilities for a wide range of operating systems, and one that is available both on-premises and via software-as-a-service (SaaS).Step 3: Establish Device HygieneMost people associate device hygiene with patch management, but it extends beyond that. Good device hygiene involves taking a proactive, multi-layered approach to ensure that only devices meeting defined security requirements are allowed to access business resources, thereby reducing the digital attack surface. Companies should look to combat device vulnerabilities (jailbroken devices, vulnerable OS versions, etc.), network vulnerabilities (man-in-the-middle attacks, malicious hotspots, unsecured Wi-Fi, etc.) and application vulnerabilities (high security risk assessment, high privacy risk assessment, suspicious app behavior, etc.). Establishing good device hygiene also includes building processes that are well-defined and repeatable so they can eventually be automated.Step 4: Secure Your UsersThe only people who seem to like passwords are the threat actors who weaponize them. Credentials, like passwords, remain among the most sought-after data types in breaches \u2013 involved in 61 percent of breaches. Further, single sign-on (SSO) solutions can create a single point of failure that can be exploited by hackers to gain access to most or all enterprise apps.The ideal solution: Passwordless authentication via zero sign-on. Instead of passwords, this approach uses multifactor authentication via alternative authentication methods such as possession (what you have, like a mobile device), inherence (biometrics like fingerprints, Face ID, etc.) and context (location, time of day, etc.).Step 5: Provide Secure AccessThe network perimeters that worked when your team was in-office no longer suffice in the Everywhere Workplace. Today\u2019s networks should be built on the principles of the software-defined perimeter (SDP). It\u2019s designed to leverage proven, standards-based components that help ensure SDP can be integrated with your existing security systems. SDP still requires a layer of security to maximize benefits, which is where zero-trust network access (ZTNA) comes into play.Step 6: Continuously Monitor & Make ImprovementsMost assessments of security posture are made after an attack, and are specific to the attack vector. This reactive approach, combined with too many empty seats in IT roles, is a substantial problem. To stay in compliance and mitigate threats, it\u2019s imperative to get a handle government, risk and compliance (GRC) management. Look for a solution with quick and easy regulatory documentation imports to map citations with security and compliance controls, and seek to replace manual tasks with automated repetitive-governance activities.There\u2019s a lot of information here \u2013 and the idea of tackling six steps can feel overwhelming. Then again, the threats are overwhelming, too. It\u2019s essential to take partners and leverage solutions to support your cybersecurity journey. The right solutions will be comprehensive and integrated to ease the burden on your IT staff, and will also preserve a productive, intuitive user experience that maintains integrity no matter where, when or how your employees work.Daniel Spicer is Chief Security Officer at\u00a0Ivanti.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s\u00a0Infosec\u00a0Insiders community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.InfoSec InsiderMalware",

        "raw text": "As we enter into a new year full of uncertainty, one thing for cybersecurity practitioners remains true: You have a strategic advantage over adversaries. It may sound obvious to say, but they\u2019re launching attacks against you, within your environment, which you control \u2013 giving you a fundamental defender\u2019s advantage.In theory.Unfortunately though, organizations often struggle to capitalize on this fundamental advantage. So below, inspired by Mandiant\u2019s first-ever published book, The Defender\u2019s Advantage, are four ideas for where to start on cyber-defense activation to get the biggest bang for your security buck \u2013 in 2022, and beyond.Establish Your Cyber-Threat Profile\u201cThe cyber-threat profile is arguably the most important document for a cyber-intelligence program. And most programs either don\u2019t have one or aren\u2019t using it to drive their operations.\u201d\u2013 Andrew Close, Principal Consultant, Intelligence Capability Development, MandiantOne of the most valuable steps an organization can take is to establish a cyber-threat profile, which is a deep-dive look at your organization\u2019s adversaries, vulnerabilities and risk. The creation of a cyber-threat profile should be based on intelligence and due diligence (not headlines) and should be used to drive action for the other cyber-defense functions.A cyber-threat profile ideally examines a combination of three key factors: the threat landscape, your organizational profile, and a risk and impact analysis.The threat landscape information layered with a granular organizational profile can provide information on the active threat actors currently launching attack campaigns on organizations like your own. The profile should include information about your attack surface, what the attackers may be after (most-valuable data or accounts), and any known vulnerabilities along with patching status. To do this, you may need to increase the visibility you have into your environment.The final piece of the triad is to understand the risk and impact of an attack on the business. Not all breaches are created equal, and an honest risk analysis can help focus resources on the most consequential activities.Organize Your Environment & Operations for BattleThere are six critical functions of cyber-defense: intel, command and control, hunt, detect, respond and validate. With your cyber-threat profile in hand, you can use it to determine your priorities and not only prepare these cyber-defenses, but advance them to active duty. Each of the six should be established and activated based on your specific cyber-threat profile.Optimize security controls and ensure they are configured in the correct locations for visibility and action. The cyber-threat profile (the intel) will determine your organization\u2019s crown jewels. The security architecture should then be designed to see all interactions with these crown-jewel assets and allow the security organization to respond to threats.Hunt for active or prior compromise based on current intelligence and knowledge of your environment. This requires close communication between the intelligence and hunt functions within a cyber-defense organization. If a compromise is detected, then a pre-established handoff with the respond function will speed investigations and allow for quicker remediation.Communicate effectively before, during and after a breach through a command and control function that will orchestrate cyber-defense actions and communications both internal and external to the security organization.Make sure to validate your capabilities (see below).Drill, Drill, Drill to Validate Capabilities\u201cIf your controls and processes don\u2019t work, you want to know before the adversary does.\u201d\u2013 Lynn Harrington, MandiantA key component of activating your cyber-defenses is to confirm that the work (and investments) you have put into technologies, processes and staff are paying off. To do this, you need to continuously validate the effectiveness of controls and operations.Using your cyber-threat profile as a guide, you can test your capabilities against active threats to your organization. This includes both external and internal threats and can be validated through automated tooling, penetration testing or cyber-range-simulated breach exercises.Another invaluable activity to regularly perform is a tabletop exercise. These exercises should cover various attack scenarios including, but not limited to, ransomware, data exfiltration and insider threats.Tabletop exercises should be held regularly throughout the year with both executive and technical groups. The value of these exercises is to practice incident-response procedures so that if (or rather, when) the \u201cworst day\u201d arrives, your organization can provide a quick and measured response. An important aspect of these exercises is to identify and practice communications with groups external to the IT security function. This can include legal counsel, insurance providers, IT functions and board communications.A great example of the need to collaborate with groups outside of the IT security function is when mapping out a mass password reset event. This is often required after a breach and must be tightly coordinated with the IT organization. Some questions to work through: Is a mass password reset event viable? What is involved in planning and how long would it take to execute? What activities need to happen on the IT and security side of things to ensure it is successful, and that it only needs to be performed once to fully mitigate the threat?Tabletop exercises coupled with controls validation will allow you to close vulnerabilities in your systems and operations to prevent or minimize the impact of a breach event.Know Your CapabilitiesThe good news is that establishing and activating your cyber-defenses doesn\u2019t have to happen overnight (although, the sooner the better.) Start with establishing a cyber-threat profile; that, validation of existing controls and operations, and business goals will then guide how you build out your capabilities from there.It can be costly to acquire the necessary expertise to shore up every function, so activating your cyber-defense can include identifying opportunities to augment the expertise in your cyber-defense organization through partnerships, outsourcing and managed services, where necessary.Remember, it may not happen overnight, but the defender\u2019s advantage is achievable \u2013 with an intelligence-driven approach, understanding the critical functions of cyber-defense and a commitment to continuous improvement.Kerry Matre is a senior director at Mandiant.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our microsite.BreachCloud SecurityCritical InfrastructureInfoSec InsiderMalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "2021 dragged itself to a close under a Log4Shell-induced blitzkrieg. With millions of Log4j-targeted attacks clocking in per hour since the flaw\u2019s discovery last month, there\u2019s been a record-breaking peak of 925 cyberattacks a week per organization, globally.The number comes out of a Monday report from Check Point Research (CPR), which found Log4Shell attacks to be a major contributor to a 50-percent increase year-over-year in overall attacks per week on corporate networks for 2021.That said, the year had already been on track to break records even before the easily exploited Log4Shell vulnerabilities in the ubiquitous Java logging library Apache Log4j cropped up, allowing unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) and complete server takeover \u2014 and leading to in-the-wild exploitation within mere hours.\nSource: CPR.CPR had reported a 40 percent increase as of October, with earlier numbers showing that one out of every 61 organizations worldwide had been hit by ransomware each week.Education/Research in the CrosshairsCPR researchers said that education/research was the sector that experienced the highest volume of attacks in 2021, with an average of 1,605 attacks per organization every week: a 75 increase from 2020. A case in point: As of Dec. 30, the advanced persistent threat (APT) Aquatic Panda was targeting universities with Log4Shell exploit tools in an attempt to steal industrial intelligence and military secrets.The second most picked-on sector was government/military, which saw 1,136 attacks per week: a 47 percent increase. Next up was the communications industry, with 1,079 attacks weekly per organization: a 51 percent increase.Source: CPR.Africa, APAC See Most AttacksAfrica experienced the highest volume of attacks last year, with an average of 1,582 weekly attacks per organization: a 13-percent increase over 2020.As shown in the chart below, APAC saw a 25 percent increase in weekly attacks per organization, with an average of 1,353 weekly attacks. Latin America, with 1,118 attacks weekly, experienced a 38 percent increase; Europe, with 670 attacks weekly, clocked a 68 percent increase; and North America, with an average of 503 weekly attacks per organization, was under attack 61 percent more than in 2020.Source: CPR.Everything\u2019s a Target, So Secure EverythingCPR\u2019s advice: \u201cIn a multi-hybrid environment, where the perimeter is now everywhere, security should be able to protect it all.\u201d Email, web browsing, servers and storage are \u201cmerely the basics,\u201d the firm said: a list to which mobile apps, cloud and external storage are also \u201cessential,\u201d as are compliance of connected mobile and endpoint devices, and internet-of-things (IoT) devices.As well, \u201cworkloads, containers and serverless applications on multi- and hybrid-cloud environments should be part of the checklist at all times,\u201d CPR recommended.Standard-issue security best practices apply: Stay up to date with security patches to stop attacks that leverage known flaws, segment networks, apply strong firewall and IPS safeguards between the network segments in order to contain infections from propagating across the entire network, and educate employees to recognize potential threats.\u201cQuite often, user awareness can prevent an attack before it occurs,\u201d CPR researchers suggested. \u201cTake the time to educate your users and ensure that if they see something unusual, they report it to your security teams immediately. User education has always been a key element in avoiding malware infections.\u201dFinally, implement advanced security technologies, CPR said. \u201cThere is not a single silver-bullet technology that can protect organizations from all threats and all threat vectors. However, there are many great technologies and ideas available \u2013 machine learning, sandboxing, anomaly detection, content disarmament and numerous more.\u201dCPR recommended two key components to consider: threat extraction (file sanitization) and threat emulation (advanced sandboxing). \u201cEach element provides distinct protection that, when used together, offer a comprehensive solution for protection against unknown malware at the network level and directly on endpoint devices.\u201dImage courtesy of Pixabay.Password Reset: On-Demand Event: Fortify 2022 with a password-security strategy built for today\u2019s threats.

        "raw text": "As we\u00a0move into 2022, bad actors are ramping up their reconnaissance efforts to ensure more successful and more impactful cyberattacks. And that means more zero-day exploits are on the horizon.When seen through an attack chain such as the MITRE ATT&CK framework, campaigns are frequently discussed in terms of left-hand and right-hand phases of threats. On the left side of the attack chain are pre-attack efforts, which includes planning, development and weaponization strategies. The more familiar execution phase of attacks is on the right side, such as building and launching malware to corrupt systems, steal data or hold networks hostage.We need to start paying more attention to the left-hand side.Increasing the Time & Effort Spent on Recon\u00a0As just noted, left-side attacks are things like gaining initial access, performing reconnaissance and the weaponization of vulnerabilities. Recognizing and stopping cyberattackers closer to the left side of the MITRE ATT&CK framework in many cases could make their efforts less effective, and give blue-team defenders multiple opportunities to mitigate a threat campaign.Because much of their work happens before an attack, advanced persistent threats (APTs) spend much time on the left. Their activities include identifying a vulnerable network, gaining unauthorized access and remaining undetected for an extended period. APTs are typically allied with nefarious organizations that have abundant resources, such as state-sponsored actors or nation-states directly.Expect to see a greater emphasis on \u201cleft-hand\u201d activities from financially motivated cybercriminals too, as incident volumes rise and more gangs compete for a slice of the profits. Like nation-state-funded APT groups, these efforts will include spending more time and effort on reconnaissance and discovering zero-day capabilities, to further their efforts.Cybercriminals understand spending more time in pre-attack reconnaissance means a greater chance of success when they launch their attack campaigns. In many situations, they can reuse the same techniques in their recon phase against multiple organizations, so although they\u2019re putting more effort upfront, they increase their chance of success and make their attacks more modular.More Ransomware Attacks, More DestructionNot only will more vulnerabilities be discovered, but the attacks that exploit them will become more readily available to other attackers and incorporated into other attack kits. The growth of malware-as-a-service will naturally converge with the rise in new vulnerabilities.So, not only will bad actors discover and weaponize more zero-day vulnerabilities, but those exploits will also be launched at a significantly higher rate due to the multiplicative effect of many cybercriminal affiliates simultaneously launching attacks.Bad actors will be able to launch attack types with greater frequency, and the destructiveness of those attacks will increase, as well. As it stands, FortiGuard Labs researchers found an almost 11x increase in ransomware in the 12 months between July 2020 and June 2021. Ransomware will remain a centerpiece of the landscape, and the expansion of crimeware will continue.Ransomware attackers already combine encryption with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS), hoping to overwhelm IT teams so they cannot take last-second actions to mitigate an attack\u2019s damage. Adding a \u201cticking time bomb\u201d of wiper malware, which could not only wreck data but destroy systems and hardware, creates additional urgency for companies to pay up quickly. Wiper malware has already made a visible comeback, targeting the Olympic Games in Tokyo, for example.Given the level of convergence seen between financial cyberattack methods and APT tactics, it\u2019s just a matter of time before destructive capabilities like wiper malware are added to ransomware toolkits. This could be a concern for critical infrastructure, supply chains and emerging edge environments.Taking Action Before It\u2019s Too LateEnterprises need to be aware that an increase in new cybercriminals armed with advanced technologies will increase the likelihood and volume of attacks. Standard tools must be able to scale to address potential increases in attack volumes. These tools also need to be enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) to detect attack patterns and stop threats in real time.Critical tools should include anti-malware engines using AI detection signatures, endpoint detection and response (EDR), advanced intrusion prevention system (IPS) detection, sandbox solutions augmented with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and next-gen firewalls (NGFWs). In the best-case scenario, these tools are deployed consistently across the distributed network (data center, campus, branch, multi-cloud, home office, endpoint) using an integrated security platform that can detect, share, correlate and respond to threats as a unified solution.Prepare NowCybercriminals are opportunistic, and they\u2019re also growing increasingly crafty. We\u2019re now seeing them spend more time on the reconnaissance side of cyberattacks. They\u2019re using left-side attacks to make the right-side attacks more effective. That means more destructive \u2013 and therefore more lucrative \u2013 ransomware attacks. It also means more frequent attacks, sometimes accompanied by DDoS hits to overwhelm IT security teams. And wiper malware is another nightmare these teams must prepare to contend with.Organizations today need an intelligent, holistic and scalable security strategy to defeat these advanced attack types. Visibility and communication across the network are crucial because they enable an immediate and coordinated response. This is the level of defense enterprises need today \u2013 and we mean today, not at some vague point down the road. Gather and integrate your tools now to ensure your network can withstand the coming storm.Aamir Lakhani is cybersecurity researcher and practitioner at FortiGuard Labs.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s\u00a0Infosec\u00a0Insiders\u00a0community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.Cloud SecurityCritical InfrastructureInfoSec InsiderIoTMalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Fallout from nation-state sponsored cyberattacks will no longer be covered under cyber-insurance policies issued by famed insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London.The insurance juggernaut\u2019s underwriting director Patrick Davidson just released four new Cyber War and Cyber Operation Exclusion Clauses, outlining the new terms.The company explained it will no longer cover losses resulting from \u201ccyber-war,\u201d which it defined as a cyber-operation carried out as part of a war, any retaliatory attacks between specified states, or a cyber-operation \u201cthat has a major detrimental impact on the functioning of a state.\u201dCountries specified in the exemption language are China, France, Japan, Russia, the U.K. and the U.S.The insurer\u2019s new definition of cyber-war leaves plenty of latitude for the insurer to refuse to pay.Under the Lloyd\u2019s of London explanation, they can also refuse to pay on nation-state-sponsored attacks on services essential for a state to function, like financial institutions, financial market infrastructure, health services and utilities, according to the exclusion documents.\u201cIn discussion with Lloyd\u2019s it has been agreed that, in respect of standalone cyber-insurance policies, these clauses meet the requirements set out in the Performance Management \u2014 Supplemental Requirements & Guidance (July 2020) which state that all insurance and reinsurance policies written at Lloyd\u2019s must, except in very limited circumstances, contain a clause which excludes all losses caused by war,\u201d Davidson said.No Attribution? Lloyd\u2019s DecidesFurther, the attack doesn\u2019t need official attribution to be excluded from the cyber-insurance policy. The exclusion documents outlined that pending any government attribution, the insurer can decide through \u201cinference which is objectively reasonable\u201d to attribute cyberattacks to state activities.It added that it can also decide whether the attack is exempt from coverage without government attribution in the event the decision takes \u201can unreasonable amount of time, does not, or is unable to attribute the cyber-operation to another state or those acting on its behalf.\u201dMore Risk, Less PayoutThis narrowing of coverage is in response to evolving threats, increased risk and a 95-percent increase in demand during the third quarter, according to Chris Reese, head of insurance at Cowbell Cyber.\u201cCyber-coverage delivers financial protection and incident-response expertise to assist businesses in returning to normal operations after an incident,\u201d she told Threatpost. \u201cIn parallel, cyber-insurance is in transition. Insurers need to overhaul their underwriting strategies to account for the unique nature of cyber-risk \u2013 evolving threats, rapidly expanding exposures because of digitization, complexity of IT infrastructure \u2013 to avoid any disconnect with the risk they commit to cover. Technology, data and automation have become core to modern underwriting for cyber.\u201dDebates over the best response to an attack generally include a close look at the calculus of relying on cyber-insurance to just pay up for a ransomware hit so the company can move on to recovery, but if insurers continue to narrow their scope of coverage, that investment could shift.In fact, researchers from Fox-IT, part of NCC group, just released data that showed whether a company carries cyberinsurance or not, attackers have already calculated how much a company can afford to pay in ransom, potentially attracting them to organizations with policies to achieve higher payouts.\u201cThe results show that the adversaries operating behind the dataset we collected knew how much ransom a victim is willing to pay before the negotiation had started,\u201d the Fox-IT analysts explained.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.\u00a0REGISTER TODAY\u00a0to learn key concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and how to use it to navigate the data ocean and add context to cybersecurity threats (without being an expert!).

        "raw text": "Security operations centers (SOCs) and threat analysts are struggling with ever-increasing and growing cyberthreats. Massive volumes of data created every second lead to new vulnerabilities and attack vectors. How do SOCs and incident response teams keep up with the threats happening across the landscape? To be effective, SOCs must have access to the right data, with the right context, at the right time to fulfill their mission of identifying and responding to threats.In order to operationalize cyberthreat intelligence, it needs to be actionable.Why Is It Important to Operationalize Your Threat Data?The flood of indicators: Security teams rarely get the most value out of their threat intel investments, given the millions of indicators that come in daily. Not all threat intelligence is relevant, forcing analysts to manually tune and score them before they can be distributed to enforcement points.Too many tools and services: As part of their cyberthreat intelligence programs, many organizations consume open source CTI, purchase feeds, view product portals, share information with industry ISACs, and purchase custom reports and services for monitoring impending threats. Somehow, the security teams have to organize, analyze, and gain knowledge from this mire of information.Time-consuming manual processes: Security teams today still rely on human intelligence to collect, correlate, contextualize, and enrich CTI \u2013 before they can use it for their benefit. With so much time spent managing technology through manual processes, organizations struggle to turn CTI into insight that can be used to fine-tune security controls, generate remediation rules, or communicate risk to business stakeholders. This cannot scale and has nothing to do with understanding and responding to threats in a timely manner.Why Consider a Threat Intelligence Management Platform?To truly achieve operationalized threat intelligence, an investment must be made in an underlying threat intelligence management platform that will enable an organization to truly harness the power of threat intelligence and translate that threat intelligence into action.Cortex\u00ae XSOAR Threat Intelligence Management introduces a completely new approach to embedding and taking action on threat intelligence across every aspect of the incident lifecycle.

Amnesty International has likewise identified cyberattacks on activists and journalists working in Uzbekistan that were carried out by the cybermercenary service.\u201cOur research revealed a clear picture: Void Balaur goes after the most private and personal data of businesses and individuals then sells that data to whomever wants to pay for it,\u201d the Trend Micro report said.For a premium fee, the group can often provide total copies of mailboxes, stolen without the assistance of the targeted user, Trend Micro reported.Void Balaur Gets Raves In Underground Forums \u00a0Enterprising, and forever collecting troves of data that could be sold later, Void Balaur\u2019s activities date back to 2015, Trend Micro analysts said. By 2019, the group was selling intensely personal data collected on Russian citizens, including criminal records, credit history, flight records, account balances and printouts of SMS text messages, the report explained.

The firm offered Void Balaur\u2019s indicators of compromise as part of its report.Void Balaur Targets Data Troves The group has also launched attacks against cryptocurrency exchanges like EMXO, which the report said has been victimized multiple times by Void Balaur.In Sept., the group targeted the intelligence agency head, government ministers and the two members of an Eastern European parliament, Trend Micro reported, but there have been attacks since 2020 on government officials and candidates in countries including Armenia, Belarus, France, Itlay, Kazakhstan, Norway, Russia and Ukraine, the report said. Void Balaur is also active in the U.S., Israel and Japan, the researchers found.Throughout 2020, Void Balaur attacked one Russian conglomerate for more than a year, demonstrating its patience and persistence, Trend Micro said. It targeted the organization\u2019s board members, executives and even family members of the billionaire company owner.The group seems to be willing to work in just about any sector that offers troves of valuable data, Trend Micro found in its analysis, including telecom, radio and satellite communications, banking, aviation and medical insurance; and even in-vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics in Russia, biotech and genetic testing.\u201cWhat makes Void Balaur stand out from most cybercriminal groups is the sheer number of different types of criminal activity they\u2019re involved in,\u201d Archie Agarwal, CEO of ThreatModeler, told Threatpost in response to the report. \u201cIt would seem that they operate in almost every industrial sector, type of data and even target high profile individuals. They certainly don\u2019t appear to discriminate.\u201dRise of the Cyber-Mercenaries Trend Micro concluded that the cybermercenary ecosystem is being bolstered by global governments\u2019 interest in using these malicious actors as part of their national cybersecurity strategies.\u201cFirst, the services and tools of cyber-mercenaries can be used in offensive attacks against terrorism and organized crime, and for targeting foreign assets,\u201d the researchers warned. \u201cSecond, they can also be sold to other countries and used as an economic or political tool in foreign policy. Though this might benefit some countries, it also poses a tremendous risk of possible backlash when malicious elements use these tools. Even worse, tools that have been sold overseas might end up being used against citizens of the country that originally exported these tools.\u201dWant to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

        "raw text": "Ransomware doesn\u2019t discriminate \u2013 today, every sector faces risks.But we are seeing changes in which sectors are being targeted the most. For instance, while healthcare and education have long been considered the most heavily attacked, that\u2019s shifting. In the latest FortiGuard Labs Global Threat Report, researchers found that the prevalence of ransomware in those two sectors was lower than managed security service providers, the automotive and manufacturing sectors, telecommunications, and government.The common denominator is that the more an industry becomes digitized, the more opportunity there is for cybercriminals. Let\u2019s look at some of the rising threats in these industries, what that means and what needs to happen next.Bad Actors Shift to Industrialized SectorsAs we saw with the attacks on Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods, industrialized sectors aren\u2019t immune to cyberattacks. In fact, they\u2019re becoming increasingly popular with bad actors. For example, manufacturing became a bigger target in the first half of 2021, with FortiGuard Labs researchers finding that ransomware was detected in 32.5 percent of these companies. That\u2019s compared with just 12.1 percent in the first half of 2020 (PDF).Automotive was another sector that saw an increase in ransomware activity: 33.6 percent in 2021, compared with just 10.8 percent in the first half of 2020 \u2013 a significant jump. And what\u2019s more, a recent report (PDF) from a cybersecurity ratings firm examined how prepared the automotive industry is and found that about half of the top 100 companies are \u201chighly susceptible\u201d to a ransomware attack.Agriculture also saw a rise in these attacks. This may seem an improbable target to some, but if you consider how tech-dependent agriculture has become, these findings make sense. A modern farm or other type of agricultural facility can have a huge number of internet-of-things (IoT) devices deployed, each with its own connections and exposures.In the first half of 2021, ransomware was detected in 28 percent of agriculture organizations that researchers observed. That\u2019s up from 9.1 percent in the first half of 2020. Researchers also observed agriculture to be among the sectors attracting more exploit attention.The Current Threat LandscapeThe past year and a half has been one of the busiest eras for cybercriminals due to the pandemic\u2019s major shift in the cyber threat landscape. The sudden shift to remote work caught many off guard and left their networks susceptible to cybercrime. Now, as work models shift once again in many countries, it is crucial to reconsider how these threats will affect the transition and how organizations can secure their networks.At this time last year, bad actors had reassigned their resources from enterprise infrastructure devices to home networks and consumer-grade products. Now, though, they are aggressively targeting both. Top intrusion prevention system (IPS) detections, for example, show that while cybercriminals aggressively target small business and consumer-grade technologies to exploit remote workers, they have also returned to targeting corporate networks and content management and application development platforms.The ransom-as-a-service (RaaS) model is also gaining traction, wherein criminals basically take on the mindset of a defender, by ransoming their \u201cconsulting services\u201d and revealing to organizations how they gained access to their networks. It\u2019s an interesting change in their mindset, and it\u2019s a proven model that makes money for the ransomware operators and their affiliates. In some cases, campaigns make millions of dollars.A Strategy for SecurityWhile law enforcement and government agencies have taken actions against cybercrime in the past, the first half of 2021 could be transformative with respect to momentum for the future. They are working with threat intelligence organizations, industry vendors and other global partnership organizations to combine resources and real-time threat intelligence to take direct action against attackers.Even so, automated threat detection and AI remain pivotal so organizations can fight attacks in real time and mitigate attacks at speed and scale across all edges. In addition, cybersecurity user awareness training remains as important as ever, with everyone being a target for cyberattacks. Everyone needs regular training on best practices to keep employees and the organization secure.Strengthen the Kill ChainBad actors aren\u2019t going to stop their nefarious activities, and the more any sector becomes digitized, the more opportunity there is for them. This means organizations across sectors must maintain a strong security posture. Partnership; training; and AI-powered prevention, detection and response are vital to defend against the threat.Countering cyber adversaries requires ongoing cybersecurity awareness training and AI-powered prevention, detection and response technologies. For comprehensive security, zero-trust access and security-driven approaches are essential. Most importantly, security devices must be integrated across endpoints, networks and the cloud.It\u2019s time for everyone to recognize their essential role in strengthening the kill chain. To disrupt cybercriminal supply chains, collaboration must be a priority. Forming partnerships and sharing data enable more effective responses and better predict future techniques to thwart attackers\u2019 efforts.Aamir Lakhani is a global security strategist and researcher at Fortinet.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our microsite.HacksInfoSec InsiderIoTMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "If you ask organizations about their top objectives, you will likely hear they need to increase visibility, reduce toolsets and adopt automation to counteract the cybersecurity skills gap. And what most don\u2019t realize is that these initiatives are driven by hurdles the industry has created for itself.Countless hours are spent trying to overcome hurdles in a process that doesn\u2019t get us any closer to thwarting threat actors. Consolidating tools, for example, is just a preservation tactic \u2014 therein lies the problem. So, how can security professionals stop using Band-Aids and reevaluate what\u2019s really going on and how to defend against threats?Understand the Race, Focus on the Finish LineThe race we\u2019re running is to develop cyber-defenses that prevent harmful impacts from attacks. The severity of those impacts differs wildly \u2014 from disrupted customer service to reputational damage from stolen data, and multifaceted extortion to regulatory fines. Thus, security teams often place focus on the race itself and forget about the actual goal or finish line.This is often shown when looking at a security function\u2019s mission statement, which typically highlights the lack of \u201cso what?\u201d and connection to the business. For example: \u201cOur mission is to continuously improve the organization\u2019s security posture by preventing, detecting, analyzing and responding to cybersecurity incidents.\u201d It is missing the finish line.The finish line is the business\u2019 ability to continue to operate in the face of threats.Increasing Visibility Is Not the Starting LineWhen I speak with security leaders, most say that visibility is the starting line for the success of their program. It is not. Increased visibility is needed because poorly configured systems and poor network hygiene require collection of massive amounts of data for threat monitoring. Yes, visibility is vitally important to enable threat monitoring; however, collecting a trove of data is not going to solve problems and will add to them if not part of a larger plan.Visibility does not drive action. It can enable execution, but it is not the trigger.Intelligence is the Starting Line, and the Power Behind the RacerThreat intelligence provides critical information on the cyber-landscape and active adversaries that shape threat profiles and unveil vulnerabilities in an organization, along with the likelihood of compromise and its potential impact to the business.Unfortunately, organizations don\u2019t know what to do with threat intelligence once they have it. It\u2019s seen as another feed into a SIEM that provides CVE information. Intelligence must be operationalized throughout cyber-defense operations to drive action and inform decision-making.The orchestration of how this is done is driven by a command-and-control (C2) function to ensure communication is flowing properly to increase effectiveness of cyber defenses and reduce duplicate efforts.C2 functions can activate intelligence by:Triggering hunt activities. A hunt team should use information about active APT groups and the latest relevant breaches to identify active or past compromise.Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on the likelihood and impact of compromise. IT and Security groups use this to inform patch and upgrade priorities.Informing security engineering teams what types of monitoring need to be in place to alert on activities tied to active APT groups (not just CVEs).Prompting security operations groups to refresh playbooks to handle updated alerts.Providing context around breaches so that incident responders can rapidly contain a breach and prevent repeat compromise.Intelligence is used to drive all actions of cyber-defense. With proper intelligence, organizations can: (1) understand what actions need to be taken, (2) identify the level of visibility needed, and (3) then determine what tools are needed to fully operationalize this intelligence.Fight the Desire to Start with ToolingThere is a deep-rooted force within the cybersecurity industry to buy shiny new tools that promise to solve all problems. Tool-buying fads have come and gone (remember when HIDS and WIDS were a thing?) Believing that shiny new tools are going to be the silver bullet against attackers is like thinking new shoes will win the race for you. Tools don\u2019t provide value unless properly activated and coordinated with other cyber-defense functions.Don\u2019t Forget About the RacerNow that we understand the race, we have new shoes, are standing at the starting line and know where to find the finish line, now we can activate the racer. Okay, maybe this metaphor has been taken a little too far \u2014 but in the spirit of breaking things down to build them back up, let\u2019s not forget about the fitness of the racer: The architectures, the tools and the users that make up organizations. This means exercising good hygiene, implementing resilient architectures and practicing secure coding practices.So What?Organizational planning for security often focuses on hurdles created by the industry, not the harmful threat actors in play. There are many disparate technologies that put immense effort towards consolidating tools \u2014 effort that should be spent fighting threats. The root of the security skills gap hurdle is not due to untrained experts on the frontlines, but because the industry has aged in a way that requires people to solve problems, which is unscalable.Whatever hurdles the industry faces (and creates for itself), knowing where the starting line is, focusing on the finish line and using threat intelligence as the power behind the runner provides the best chance of winning the race.Kerry Matre is senior director at Mandiant.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.Cloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 The in-person Black Hat USA 2021 cybersecurity conference is back, after a pandemic-forced, year-long hiatus, with attendance notably down but spirts up among attendees eager to get back to networking, learning and returning to some normalcy.Event founder Jeff Moss kicked off Wednesday\u2019s keynote with a nod to those lost to COVID-19 and others such as Philippe Courtot and Dan Kaminsky, who have passed since Black Hat\u2019s last 2019 in-person event. While noting the challenges COVID-19 presents to the medical community, he also drew comparisons to lessons to be learned within the cybersecurity community.In his address, Moss asked the audience to consider how participants can work together to help address today\u2019s most pressing cybersecurity problems in the same way that present-day doctors, healthcare policymakers and individuals can help mitigate COVID-19.Cybersecurity Lessons Learned from Fighting COVID-19 Moss began by drawing an analogy between a cybersecurity firewall and vaccine.\u201cIs there a way to sort of confirm immunity on a network, if you take care of your own equipment?\u201d Moss asked. \u201cThis is an analogy I like, because if you think about how doctors approach problems, nobody gets up in the morning and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to cure cancer.'\u201dSimilarly, security researchers don\u2019t \u201cwake up in the morning and cure memory corruption,\u201d he noted.While it\u2019s unrealistic to cure cancer, it\u2019s more realistic to be part of a team.\u201cIf you also think about some of the other medical analogies like \u2018do no harm,\u2019 they also work well in our world,\u201d Moss said. He cited core principles of \u201cdon\u2019t harm users\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t give away their privacy.\u201dBlack Hat USA 2021Real World and Cybersecurity Collide with \u2018Modes of Immunity\u2019Moss described three modes of immunity within the fights of COVID-19 and cybersecurity.\u201cFirst, there is the mode where no one is immunized. There is disease running rampant in the community [unchecked],\u201d Moss said. The networked world equivalent is \u201cno systems are maintained, patched and updated. There\u2019s nobody watching the logs. So, the malware spreads unchecked through the network.\u201dIn the second mode of immunity, Moss said, some of population is immunized. \u201cThe contagious disease spreads through some of the population, and some networks, and some systems are not maintained. So malware is sometimes noticed and sometimes spreads through some of the population.\u201dMoss believes that similar to COVID mitigation, the cybersecurity community is \u201cstuck\u201d in this second mode.The third modality, he said, is more optimistic. \u201cThis is [where] most of the population is immunized. The spread of contagious diseases is contained. That is what we\u2019re working toward: 70 percent to 80 percent immunization.\u201dWhat that looks like in the digital world, Moss said, is when \u201cmost networks and systems are maintained, malware is noticed most of the time [and removed most of the time], and actions are taken to protect other systems besides your own system.\u201dBlack Hat USA 2012 had a noticeably smaller attendance in the opening keynote compared with prior years.It Takes a Cybersecurity VillageUnderstanding that cybersecurity is not a solitary effort but rather interdependent on others is key to addressing today\u2019s biggest security risks \u2013 similar to the medical community\u2019s collaboration to contain COVID-19 infections.\u201cIn this third step, you are concerned about the networks around you, not just your own stuff. That\u2019s the difference. You\u2019re thinking about the others around you,\u201d Moss saidHe shared the analogy of a business that patches and updates its own systems and then calls it a day.\u201cYou select good software. You filter spoofed inbound traffic, but you\u2019re not filtering outbound traffic. You are validating [domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC) queries: a set of protocols that add a layer of security to the domain name system], but you\u2019re not citing your own zones,\u201d Moss said. \u201cNow, nobody else can rely on your records because you\u2019re not signing your mail servers. Maybe you check [Sender-Policy Framework, or SPF] records, but you don\u2019t publish your own SPF records.\u201dIn this common scenario, companies are getting the benefits of third-party cybersecurity intelligence, but not providing any benefits to anybody else.If You Aren\u2019t Part of the Solution\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re only really helping yourself: pretty selfish. If we know anything, [we know] that the internet is so connected that our problems are connected,\u201d he said.The end state, Moss said, is full immunization. \u201cThis is where you\u2019re actually confirming immunity to those around you.\u201d It is also, likely, the most beneficial to all the users of the internet, Moss said. \u201cIt\u2019s the best security stance you can take with the least liability \u2013 because you can show you\u2019re taking these proactive steps.\u201d\u201cI just want you to think about, What are you doing to try to confer an immunity to those around you? Are you part of the problem? Are you a user and just getting the benefit of those around you?\u201dWhether it be network or software security, the premise is the same.\u201cFrom a software supply chain standpoint, we all rely on the software supply chain. We are building tools and systems based on [trusting others]. We are hoping people we trust in the supply chain, are in that third state and they are doing things to help everybody else in the supply chain,\u201d Moss said.He warned, if those in the cybersecurity community don\u2019t consider the interconnected nature of mitigating risk, \u201ceverything we do is potentially vulnerable.\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from? We\u2019ve got your back.

        "raw text": "The U.S. has made a key move to shore up its cybersecurity strategy, with the confirmation of Jen Easterly as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Monday.Easterly, a former official at the National Security Agency from 2011 to 2013 and two-time Bronze Star winner, fills the empty position left by Chris Krebs, who was fired from the post under then-President Trump in 2020. Easterly comes to the role fresh from the private sector: She was most recently responsible for Morgan Stanley\u2019s resilience strategy. Before that, she worked to set up the U.S. Cyber Command.Meanwhile, Monday also saw the swearing in of Chris Inglis as the first White House national cyber-director. Inglis, a former NSA deputy director, will be responsible for communicating and coordinating cybersecurity policy across Congress, federal agencies and the White House, according to reports. It\u2019s a new position that was created as part of the most recent National Defense Authorization Act and roughly correlates with the White House cyber-czar role that Trump eliminated in 2018.The Senate unanimously approved both nominations last month, but the confirmation votes were delayed after Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) held up Department of Homeland Security nominees until President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southern border. Eventually, Harris did visit, and Scott lifted his moratorium.Congrats to Jen Easterly on her confirmation as the next @CISAgov Director. The perfect leader for an increasingly important agency. Bravo to Brandon Wales to leading the agency the last 8 months. Excited to watch this team continue to do great things. #DefendTodaySecureTomorrow https://t.co/RNHLPlfYvB\u2014 Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) July 12, 2021\u201cNation-states and non-state actors alike now leverage cyberspace with near impunity to threaten our security, our privacy, and our physical and digital infrastructure,\u201d Easterly said during [PDF] her June confirmation hearing. \u201cOur adversaries combine hacking with malign influence operations to interfere in democratic processes. They breach major corporations to steal capital and intellectual treasure, target industrial control systems to disrupt critical infrastructure, and incapacitate entities large and small with the scourge of ransomware. Even as we contend with the billions of daily intrusions against our networks by malicious actors, I believe that as a nation, we remain at great risk of a catastrophic cyberattack.\u201dJen Easterly. Source: Morgan Stanley.Cybersecurity: A Top U.S. Priority\u201cThe threats of cyberattacks aren\u2019t just looming \u2013 they [are] here and harming us every day,\u201d Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), the co-chairman of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, King said in a statement provided to The Hill. \u201cGiven that cybersecurity touches every aspect of our government and our lives \u2013 from our laptops to the Internet of Things \u2013 the U.S. desperately needs centralized leadership to coordinate the federal response to improve our defenses.\u201dThe move comes as large cyberattacks continue to make headlines, such as the REvil ransomware attack that affected 1,5000 customers of Kaseya\u2019s network-management platform earlier this month. Or, the now-infamous Colonial Pipeline ransomware disruption that shut down gas availability throughout the South and the Eastern seaboard.Chris Inglis. Source: The NSA.Ransomware has become so endemic that President Biden has made combatting it a piece of his foreign-policy dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, given that many of the financially motivated gangs behind ransomware are headquartered in former Soviet Bloc countries.Previously, the administration has wrestled with the fallout of the massive SolarWinds espionage attack, carried out by Russian nation-state cyberattackers, which hit at least nine government agencies and several tech companies.\u201cSolarWinds, Hafnium, Colonial Pipeline, JBS and other incidents all signal the urgent need to secure our national critical infrastructure,\u201d Inglis said during his confirmation hearing opening statement [PDF]. \u201cThe pace of events and our adversaries deny us the luxury of biding our time before we seize back the initiative that has too long been ceded to criminals and rogue nations who determine the time and manner of their transgressions.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Critical InfrastructureGovernmentHacksIoTMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "On June 9, 2021, the III annual international online training event Cyber Polygon took place. It connects various global organisations to train their competencies, exchange best practices and bring tangible results to the world community. 200 organizations from 48 countries tested their skills in repelling cyber threats as part of Cyber \u200b\u200bPolygon 2021.Cyber Polygon is an initiative by strategic digital risk management company BI.ZONE, part of Sber\u2019s ecosystem, with support from the World Economic Forum (WEF) Centre for Cybersecurity and INTERPOL.The training event consists of two parallel tracks: an online conference for a wide audience and a practical segment for cybersecurity experts.Two hundred organizations took part in the technical training event, including major financial and technological companies and representatives of public institutions, law enforcement agencies, telecommunications and energy organizations, and a variety of other sectors. The teams learned how to deflect targeted supply chain attacks within a corporate ecosystem.The high-level expert discussion during the online conference on different cybersecurity aspects involved Steve Wozniak, Apple co-founder; J\u00fcrgen Stock, Secretary-General of Interpol; Roger Halbheer, Chief Security Advisor, Microsoft; Peter Maurer, President, International Committee of the Red Cross; Mark Barnett, President of Mastercard Europe; Mathew Dill, Global Head of Strategic Partnerships and Ventures, Senior Vice President, Visa, and other international speakers. Over 7 million viewers from 78 countries joined the online broadcast of the expert sessions.Even a direct line with the astronauts who are now on the International Space Station was organized, during which they unveiled that the most vulnerable data from the ISS is protected with encryption and cannot be decrypted during transfer even if tapped.Technological innovations continue to define the business development directions, relations between people and sometimes even countries. Governments and businesses create ecosystems, which are networks of companies and various services. Growing bigger and wider, ecosystems may become more vulnerable. How to ensure the sustainability and safe evolution of corporate ecosystems? Sber\u2019s CEO Herman Gref spoke about this at the dedicated session Ecosystems as a new way of global integration with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. The speakers discussed how Apple developed, what obstacles and risks ecosystems face today, and what role technology and education play in the development of the digital world.During the session dedicated to developing an international response to combating ransomware Craig Jones, Cybercrime Director at INTERPOL, stated that international regulation at this stage is not enough for the cybercrime level. According to him, the popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to the spread of ransomware. Therefore, cryptocurrencies need to be brought into the broad international financial structure to reduce the number of \u201csafe havens\u201d for cybercriminals.The cryptocurrencies topic was raised not only once during the event. There was a special session dedicated to making the financial system resilient as digital currencies proliferate with the participation of Mark Barnett, President of Mastercard Europe, Mathew Dill, Global Head of Strategic Partnerships and Ventures, Senior Vice President, Visa and Alexey Zabotkin, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Russia. The experts agreed that the financial industry is always among the first to embrace innovations and it is necessary to estimate the possible risks of new technologies, in addition to their advantages.The final session of the Cyber Polygon 2021 was a dialogue between Stanislav Kuznetsov, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of Sber, and UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta H. Fore about the problem of cyberbullying and protecting children from the threats of the digital world.Stanislav Kuznetsov, Deputy Chairman of the Executive Board of Sber said:For the third year in a row, Cyber \u200b\u200bPolygon has brought together top executives of government agencies and large international organizations, cybersecurity experts and IT specialists from around the world. We spoke about the opportunities and risks of technological development, discussed the security of digital currencies, and imagined the future of the digital state. I think it is especially important that we also discussed the topic of protecting children in cyberspace at the event. SponsoredWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Hackers sent Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign staffers malicious emails that impersonated anti-virus software company McAfee, and used a mix of legitimate services (such as Dropbox) to avoid detection. The emails were an attempt to steal staffers\u2019 credentials and infect them with malware.The unsuccessful advanced persistent threat group (APT) attacks on Biden\u2019s campaign were first uncovered in June, along with cyberattacks targeting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. However, the details of the attacks themselves, and the tactics used, were scant until Google Threat Analysis Group\u2019s (TAG) Friday analysis.\u201cIn one example, attackers impersonated McAfee,\u201d said researchers on Friday. \u201cThe targets would be prompted to install a legitimate version of McAfee anti-virus software from GitHub, while malware was simultaneously silently installed to the system.\u201dThe campaign was based on email based links that would ultimately download malware hosted on GitHub, researchers said. The malware was specifically a python-based implant using Dropbox for command and control (C2), which once downloaded would allow the attacker to upload and download files and execute arbitrary commands.Every malicious piece of this attack was hosted on legitimate services \u2013 making it harder for defenders to rely on network signals for detection, researchers noted.The McAfee lure used in the Biden cyberattack. Credit: GoogleGoogle attributed the attack on Biden\u2019s campaign staff to APT 31\u00a0(also known as Zirconium). According to reports, this threat actor is tied to the Chinese government.Beyond staffers on the \u201cJoe Biden for President\u201d campaign, APT 31 has also been targeting \u201cprominent individuals in the international affairs community, academics in international affairs from more than 15 universities,\u201d according to previous Microsoft research.The threat group\u2019s\u00a0TTPs include using web \u201cbeacons\u201d that are tied to an attacker-controlled domain. The group then sends the URL of the domain to targets via email text (or attachment) and persuades them to click the link via social engineering.\u201cAlthough the domain itself may not have malicious content, [this] allows Zirconium [APT 31] to check if a user attempted to access the site,\u201d said Microsoft. \u201cFor nation-state actors, this is a simple way to perform reconnaissance on targeted accounts to determine if the account is valid or the user is active.\u201dOn the other side of the coin, the personal email accounts of staffers associated with the \u201cDonald J. Trump for President\u201d campaign have also been targeted by another threat group called APT 35 (also known as Phosphorus and Charming Kitten), which researchers said operates out of Iran. The Iran-linked hacking group has been known to use phishing as an attack vector, and\u00a0in February\u00a0was discovered targeting public figures in phishing attacks that stole victims\u2019 email-account information.Government backed attacker warnings sent in 2020. Credit: GoogleHowever, researchers said the good news is that there\u2019s increased attention on the threats posed by APTs in the context of the U.S. election. Google for its part said it removed 14 Google accounts that were linked to Ukrainian Parliament member Andrii Derkach shortly after the U.S. Treasury\u00a0sanctioned\u00a0Derkach for attempting to influence the U.S. elections.\u201cU.S government agencies have warned about different threat actors, and we\u2019ve worked closely with those agencies and others in the tech industry to share leads and intelligence about what we\u2019re seeing across the ecosystem,\u201d said Google researchers.With the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election just around the corner, cybersecurity concerns are under the spotlight \u2013 including worries about\u00a0the integrity of voting machines, the expected\u00a0expansion of mail-in voting\u00a0due to COVID-19\u00a0and disinformation campaigns.GovernmentVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A slew of popular free Android antivirus apps in recent testing proved to have security holes and privacy issues \u2013 including a critical vulnerability that exposes user\u2019s address books, and another serious flaw that enables attackers to turn off antivirus protection entirely.According to an analysis from Comparitech of 21 Android antivirus vendors, three of the apps tested (from VIPRE Mobile, AEGISLAB and BullGuard) had serious security flaws, and seven apps couldn\u2019t detect a test virus. In total, 47 percent of the vendors tested failed in some way.Security VulnerabilitiesVIPRE\u2019s popular app was found to have two insecure direct object reference (IDOR) bugs, including a critical flaw that put premium users with address book sync enabled at risk of having their contacts stolen, including full names, photos, addresses and notes with sensitive personal information.\u201cUsing the online dashboard, we discovered it was possible for attackers to access the address books of VIPRE Mobile users with cloud sync enabled,\u201d Comparitech researchers said in a blog posting on Thursday. \u201cBased on our proof-of-concept and the popularity of the app, we estimate over a million contacts were sitting on the web unsecured.\u201dThe flaw was caused by broken or poorly implemented access control, which manifests as an IDOR vulnerability in VIPRE Mobile\u2019s backend.\u201cThe script responsible only checked to make sure the attacker was logged in,\u201d researchers said. \u201cNo further checking was done to ensure the request was being performed by the proper device or account.\u201dThe other serious flaw opened the door to an attacker sending fake antivirus alerts.\u201cGenerating fraudulent alerts and sending them to unsuspecting users was trivial,\u201d researchers said. \u201cWe found we could edit fields in the alert request to make it say whatever we wanted. We were able to push fake alerts by capturing the request generated when a virus is found, then manipulating the request to change the user ID and other parameters. The result is an entirely real looking virus alert displayed on the victim\u2019s VIPRE Mobile dashboard.\u201dBullGuard\u2019s app meanwhile also contained a serious IDOR flaw, which meant that all users were vulnerable to an attacker remotely disabling their antivirus protection. Also, the app had a serious cross-site scripting issue (XSS) that would allow attackers to insert malicious code because of a vulnerableThe IDOR vulnerability would allow an attacker to iterate through customer IDs and disable BullGuard on every device.\u201cWe were able to intercept and alter the request to disable BullGuard Mobile antivirus,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cOur testing found the request generated when a user shuts off antivirus protection can be captured and altered. By changing the user ID in this request, antivirus protection on any device can be disabled. Access control did not appear to be in place to ensure the correct user was making the request.\u201dIn addition, Comparitech found that one of the scripts responsible for processing new users on the BullGuard website is vulnerable to XSS.\u201cThe script in question doesn\u2019t sanitize any parameters passed to it, which enables an attacker to run malicious code,\u201d they explained.Attackers could exploit this to display an alert on the page, hijack sessions, harvest personal data or use the website as a platform for phishing campaigns.And finally, users of the AEGISLAB web dashboard were also at risk from a serious XSS flaw that would open the door to attackers inserting malicious code, because the firm didn\u2019t lock down the app\u2019s dashboard.\u201cWe found several XSS flaws affecting one script running on the my2.aegislab.com domain,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cBecause none of the parameters passed to the script were sanitized, it would have been trivial for an attacker to execute malicious code.\u201dAll three vendors have updated their apps to address the vulnerabilities, according to Comparitech.Virus Detection and PrivacyIn addition to the security issues, many apps were found to fall down on the job when it came to basic detection. AEGISLAB Antivirus Free; Antiy AVL Pro Antivirus & Security; Brainiacs Antivirus System; Fotoable Super Cleaner; MalwareFox Anti-Malware; NQ Mobile Security & Antivirus Free; Tap Technology Antivirus Mobile; and Zemana Antivirus & Security failed to detect a test virus.\u201cThe Metasploit payload we used attempts to open a reverse shell on the device without obfuscation,\u201d explained the researchers, in a posting on Thursday. \u201cIt was built for exactly this sort of testing. Every Android antivirus app should be able to detect and stop the attempt.\u201dOn the privacy front, many of the \u201cfree\u201d apps display targeted ads. So, the researchers also used information from the Exodus mobile privacy database to look for dangerous permissions and advertising trackers.\u201cIn our analysis, dfndr security was far and away the worst offender,\u201d the firm said. \u201cThe sheer number of advertising trackers bundled with the app is impressive. As far as we can tell, dfndr puts users search and browser habits up for sale on every ad exchange there is.\u201ddfndr also requests permission to access fine location data, access the camera, read and write contacts, look through the address book, and grab the IMEI (unique ID) and phone number of the device, according to the analysis.The vendor did not immediately return a request for comment.The issues found are a testament to the fact that mobile malware is still not a high-volume threat, the researchers said.\u201cIn 2018, Kaspersky Labs reported it blocked 116.5 million virus and malware infections on Android and iOS devices; that sounds like a huge amount but, according to their numbers, only 10 percent of users in the U.S., 5 percent in Canada, and 6 percent in the U.K. needed to be protected from a mobile threat last year,\u201d explained the analysts. \u201cSo vendors focus on adding features to differentiate themselves, sometimes instead of improving their codebase. And they clearly don\u2019t always do a great job. Every vulnerability we found was with a system incidental to the actual virus scanning.\u201dMobile attacks will be a focus next week at Black Hat 2019, taking place Aug. 7 and 8 in Las Vegas.

For days now, Microsoft has been adding more antivirus titles to those impacted by the issue.Those antivirus titles affected are: Sophos Endpoint and Sophos Enterprise Console, Avira antivirus software, ArcaBit antivirus software, Avast\u00a0and McAfee Security Threat Prevention 10.x and McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention 8.0.McAfee is the latest antivirus vendor to issue a warning to its customers. On Thursday it said Microsoft\u2019s security update is causing affected systems to boot up slowly and run slowly.\u201cMcAfee is investigating this issue and will resolve it in a future update,\u201d McAfee wrote.Earlier this week, Sophos sent a note to customers explaining, \u201cAfter installing certain Microsoft Windows updates\u2026 Sophos has received reports of computers failing to boot. Sophos is actively investigating this issue and will update this article when more information is available.\u201dSophos notes those running Sophos Intercept X are not affected.It\u2019s unclear what the root cause of the issue is. Microsoft describes symptoms tied the April security update and the Kerberos implementation in several versions of Windows. Kerberos\u00a0is a key authentication protocol that\u2019s used in a huge number of open-source and commercial products.\u201cAfter installing this update, some customers report that authentication fails for services that require unconstrained delegation after the Kerberos ticket expires (the default is 10 hours). For example, the SQL server service fails,\u201d Microsoft wrote.Microsoft is offering a technical workaround with options such as purging the Kerberos tickets on affected systems, restarting the Internet Information Services app pool and use \u201cconstrained delegation\u201d.\u201cMicrosoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release,\u201d according to Microsoft.McAfee and Avast, both suggest the problem are tied to a change Microsoft made to the Windows Client-Server Runtime Subsystem (csrss.exe). The CSRSS is a vital part of Windows, responsible for the user mode side of Win32 subsystem driving console windows and the shutdown process, according to a description.\u201cChanges in the Windows April 2019 update for Client Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) introduced a potential deadlock with ENS,\u201d McAfee wrote.Avast reports customers running Avast for Business, Avast CloudCare, and AVG Business Edition on Windows machines, particularly those with Windows 7 operating systems are impacted by the issue.

        "raw text": "A new malware sample using a rare obfuscation technique has been spotted that uses the features of PowerShell, a tool that comes built in to Microsoft Windows.\u00a0Analysis from Cylance shows that the tactic succeeds in bypassing most antivirus products.Cylance researchers stumbled across a malware file using a PowerShell obfuscation method while looking into a set of malicious scripts that had low antivirus detection. The file was a ZIP file containing both a PDF document and VBS script, and it was flagged by just three antivirus products.It takes a page from other common obfuscation techniques, which include using packers to compress a malware program; encryption to hide its unique strings of code; or techniques that mutate malware cosmetics, such as the overall number of bytes in the program. All of these alter the hash and the signature of the malware so that common antivirus tools won\u2019t flag it as a known malicious agent.\u201cThese techniques change the overall structure of a piece of malware without altering its function,\u201d explained researchers at Cylance, in a technical analysis\u00a0posted\u00a0Wednesday on the tactic. \u201cOften, this has the overall result of creating layers which act to bury the ultimate payload, like the nested figures in a Russian doll.\u201dPowerShell: A New ToyIn the PowerShell gambit, the aforementioned VBS script used a rudimentary Base64 encoding to obfuscate the first layer. That VBS script then downloaded and executed a DAT file via PowerShell. The team found that the script used techniques like string-splitting through concatenation and variable assignment, as well as the use of tick marks and random letter capitalizations to split up the words or signatures that antivirus companies commonly rely upon for malicious PowerShell identification.\u201cThe file 1cr.dat is where things got interesting,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cIt uses a method of string encryption inherent in C# called SecureString\u2026commonly used to encrypt sensitive strings within applications using Microsoft\u2019s built-in DPAPI.\u201dThey added that the script itself downloaded the file \u201cravigel.com/top.dat\u201d which was a ZIP archive containing a PE file encoded by the ordinal representation of each hex byte separated by a space character, and prefaced with the heading \u201cgoogle\\r\\n.\u201dMeanwhile, the actual payload is \u201ca simple espionage tool widely known to the security community.\u201d\u201cThe cat-and-mouse game of detection and response isn\u2019t new,\u201d Kevin Livelli, director of threat intelligence at Cylance, told Threatpost. \u201cAttackers, whether they\u2019re advanced groups or common criminals, are astute observers of target defenses and adapt accordingly. Malware doesn\u2019t have to be especially complicated or even new to be effective. Obfuscation gives attackers a simple and cheap way to get the job done until the industry adapts and attackers move on to the next technique.\u201dCommodity Malware on the RiseThe development fits a trend that sees threat actors turning to commodity malware, overcoming the fact that its well-known fingerprints are easy to detect by implementing ever-better obfuscation methods.The sheer volume of commodity malware out there ironically works in threat actors\u2019 favor. \u201cWhen the fingerprint of a piece of malware is known to all and is within the reach of everyone, the threat actor can hide amongst an impossibly large group of suspects. The payload signature is essentially rendered meaningless,\u201d the researchers explained.They added, \u201cThis trend runs counter to a widely-held assumption in the information security space which holds that highly customized malware paired with zero-day exploits are deserving of the most attention.\u201dMalware",

        "raw text": "Two aged samples of North Korean antivirus software called SiliVaccine crib software code from a competitor and come loaded with malware and a backdoor.The two SiliVaccine samples obtained by researchers at Check Point security offer unique insight into a secretive country and how it likely protects users from outside threats; and how the AV company behind SiliVaccine could spy on its users.Check Point\u2019s researchers began dissecting a version of SiliVaccine obtained by journalist Martyn Williams in 2014. That\u2019s when Williams received a mysterious Dropbox download link to the software via email from a Japanese tipster identified only as \u201cKang Yong Hak.\u201d The email account went dark soon after.At the time, Williams detailed the functions of the software, which he identified as version 4.0 of SiliVaccine, that he said was published in 2002 by the software\u2019s maker Pyonyang Gwangmyong Information Technology and STS Tech-Service.Both intrigued and cautious by the rare North Korean AV software sample, Williams contacted a trusted British AV firm in 2014 who said the sample of SiliVaccine he received \u201cdidn\u2019t appear to be malicious.\u201dSeveral weeks ago, Check Point re-examined the reporter\u2019s 2014 sample and concluded that SiliVaccine\u2019s antivirus engine code belongs to Japan-based Trend Micro. It also discovered the Jaku malware was bundled with the AV software\u2019s installation files (as a patch) and that the software purposely ignored specific malicious code signatures \u2013 a security hole in the software that could allow an adversary to install malware without sounding any AV alarms.\u201cWe believe that Williams himself was being targeted by North Korea,\u201d said Check Point researcher Mark Lechtik in an interview with Threatpost. A full analysis of the SiliVaccine code is available on the Check Point blog.It\u2019s unclear if Williams was being singled out as a journalist and may have been targeted in a malware campaign to gain access his computer. Researchers said they believe that the sample Williams received was also part of a wider distribution, based on a second malware sample obtained by Check Point with the same snooping features and installation routine that planted Jaku malware on a target\u2019s PC.\u201cWe have managed to obtain another sample of a much older version of this software (from 2003) via a different (trusted) source,\u201d Check Point told Threatpost. \u201cFrom analyzing this version we can confirm that our conclusions are relevant for at least 2 versions of this software, with a difference of 10 years between one another, indicating it\u2019s not a one-off. More importantly \u2013 it confirms we were not looking at a modified or fake version to begin with.\u201dMakers of Trend Micro also confirmed that the SiliVaccine software contained a decade-old version of its scan engine, VSAPI.It\u2019s unclear how the makers of SiliVaccine obtained the VSAPI scan engine code, however it\u2019s theorized by Check Point that the publisher of the AV software (STS Tech-Service) previously worked in Japan with Silver Star and Magnolia. That company worked with a North Korean research entity known as the Korean Computer Center.Trend Micro has emphasized that the use of the 10-year-old AV engine by SiliVaccine in no way jeopardizes the company\u2019s current or legacy AV products.It\u2019s also unclear how tightly SiliVaccine is aligned with the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK). Check Point noted, \u201cthe software itself contains metadata that puts PGI (a DPRK government entity) as one of the authors, while the other developer, STS Tech-Service, seems to also have strong ties to the government and the KCC (Korea computer Center).\u201dAnother digital crumb was found by Check Point in its analysis of the Jaku malware\u2019s electronic signature.\u201cOur investigation found though that the Jaku file was signed with a certificate issued to a certain \u2018Ningbo Gaoxinqu zhidian Electric Power Technology Co., Ltd\u2019, the same company that was used to sign files by another well-known APT group, \u2018Dark Hotel\u2019. Both JAKU and Dark Hotel are thought to be attributed to North Korean threat actors,\u201d Check Point said.Threatpost was unable to contact both Pyonyang Gwangmyong Information Technology and STS Tech-Service.HacksMalwarePrivacy",

        "raw text": "The operators behind the RobbinHood ransomware are using a vulnerable, legacy driver from Taiwan-based motherboard manufacturer Gigabyte in order to get around antivirus protections. The \u201cbring-your-own-bug\u201d tactic is likely to crop up in other attacks going forward, according to security analysts.According to research from Sophos, the driver has a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-19320), and was discontinued in 2018 by the company. However, the Verisign certificate used to digitally sign the driver has not been revoked, so the signature remains valid.\u201cThe adversaries deployed a legitimate, digitally signed hardware driver in order to delete security products from the targeted computers just prior to performing the destructive file encryption portion of the attack,\u201d the researchers explained, in an analysis posted late last week.Bring Your Own VulnerabilityRobbinHood ransomware is best-known for being the culprit behind the encryption attack on the City of Baltimore in 2019. The threat actors now have a new tactic.Specifically, they\u2019re updating the Windows kernel in-memory with the Gigabyte driver, according to the research \u2013 and the kernel accepts it as a \u201cpatch\u201d thanks to the signed certificate. Once that\u2019s loaded, they can then exploit that driver using the known vulnerability in order to load their own, unsigned, malicious driver.Using the Gigabyte driver saves the attackers time and headaches, Sophos noted.\u201c64-bit Windows\u2026only allows drivers to be loaded that have been properly signed by both the manufacturer and Microsoft,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThe malware authors did not bother to sign their malicious driver as it involves purchasing a certificate. Also, a purchased certificate can be revoked by the certificate authority.\u201dThe properly signed Gigabyte driver on the other hand will be easily accepted by Windows. And it just so happens to contain a privilege-escalation vulnerability as it allows reading and writing of arbitrary memory.\u201cThe malware authors abuse this vulnerability in order to (temporarily) disable driver signature enforcement in Windows \u2013 on-the-fly, in kernel memory. [They do this] by changing a single variable (a single byte) that lives in kernel space\u2026.Once driver signature enforcement is disabled, the attackers are able to load their unsigned malicious driver,\u201d said researchers.That second driver is tasked with defanging security applications from the kernel space. It \u201cgoes to great lengths to kill processes and files belonging to endpoint-security products, bypassing tamper protection, to enable the ransomware to attack without interference,\u201d researchers explained.The Kernel SubversionDuring the attack, the cybercriminals are subverting a setting in kernel memory on Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. To do this, the RobbinHood malware makes use of a process called STEEL.EXE, which in turn uses several different files to carry out its task \u2013 all of which are extracted to the Windows Temp folder during the initial infection.First, the STEEL.EXE application deploys ROBNR.EXE. This is the application that drops and installs both the vulnerable Gigabyte driver (GDRV.SYS) but also the second, malicious driver (RBNL.SYS). After that, STEEL.EXE reads a text file, named PLIST.TXT, for further instructions.PLIST.TXT contains a list of processes and their associated files that the malicious driver is tasked with destroying, researchers said; and because the text file is not embedded in STEEL.EXE, it may be tailored to the victim\u2019s environment.The malicious driver has various ways to delete files, and it runs all of them in sequence to cover all the bases, according to the firm.\u201cTo delete files that are in-use, the malicious driver issues an I/O Request Packet (or IRP, a low-level message passed between device drivers) directly on the NTFS.SYS storage device,\u201d according to the writeup. \u201cBy clearing the ImageSectionObject and DataSectionObject pointers, the storage device assumes the files are not in-use and the file is safely deleted, even when the file is still running as a process.\u201dAfter the file-deletion process is complete, the malicious driver ends the STEEL.EXE process, and the ransomware portion of the malware is free to encrypt files without being hindered by security products.An Attack with Staying PowerKilling such security processes from kernel mode offers plenty of upside for the attackers, Sophos noted \u2014 and as such, it\u2019s a technique that\u2019s likely to show up in other campaigns.\u201cEndpoint protection processes that rely on object handle filtering for their tamper protection cannot prevent a kernel mode termination of processes or deletion of files,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThe process handles opened by the malicious driver are kernel handles, and kernel handles cannot be filtered. So, the malicious kernel driver can kill these processes without interference of endpoint security controls.\u201dGoing forward, researchers noted that the technique can be replicated using a range of buggy drivers, as long as they allow arbitrary read/write in kernel.\u201cEven though the attackers are using the GDRV.SYS driver to do this today, there\u2019s no reason they will continue to use it if it becomes untenable to do so,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThere are many other vulnerable drivers (with a similar vulnerability) in addition to the Gigabyte driver that these or other attackers may choose to abuse later, such as ones from VirtualBox (CVE-2008-3431), Novell (CVE-2013-3956), CPU-Z (CVE-2017-15302), or ASUS (CVE-2018-18537). But in these attacks, we\u2019ve only seen the Gigabyte driver being abused in this way.\u201dLearn how Operational Technology and Information Technology systems are merging and changing security playbooks in this free Threatpost Webinar.

Fake Malwarebytes ads served up by the PopCash network on adult websites take visitors to the watering-hole site. The firm said that it contacted PopCash to report the malicious advertisements.Whether they arrive via organic means or via an ad, once visitors hit the site, the Fallout exploit kit (EK) is used to infect vulnerable machines with the Raccoon data-harvesting malware. Raccoon scours systems for credit card information, cryptocurrency wallets, passwords, emails, cookies, system information and data from popular browsers (including saved credit-card info, URLs, usernames and passwords), and then sends that data back to its operator.The fake site. Click to enlarge.Raccoon is a relatively new malware that is under active development by the hackers behind it, according to a previous analysis from Cofense. It\u2019s sold on underground forums as a malware-as-a-service offering in both Russian and English, and includes around-the-clock customer support.First spotted in April of 2019, Raccoon has been leveraged in several different campaigns since then. Cofense for instance saw a campaign in November where scurried past Microsoft and Symantec anti-spam messaging gateways, by using .IMG files hosted on a hacker-controlled Dropbox account.According to additional research, the malware had infected hundreds of thousands of Windows systems as of last October.Interestingly, the Malwarebytes analysts also found that the operators of the fake-site campaign appear to have tried similar tactics with other security firms \u2013 notably Cloudflare. That effort used a similar copycat site that was disseminated via malvertising.\u201cWe believe this may be the same threat actor already involved in ongoing adult malvertising campaigns and using the Fallout exploit kit,\u201d researchers at Malwarebytes told Threatpost. \u201cThe attacks are not sophisticated but the spread among various ad platforms is fairly wide. Typically we see malvertising via one or two ad networks simultaneously, but this threat actor has diversified his traffic leads.\u201dMalwarebytes researchers believe that the targeting of security firms could be a deliberate tactic meant as payback for revealing malvertising activity.\u201cThe few malvertising campaigns that remain are often found on second- and third-tier adult sites, leading to the Fallout or RIG exploit kits, as a majority of threat actors have moved on to other distribution vectors,\u201d Malwarebytes said in its post. \u201cHowever, we believe this faux Malwarebytes malvertising campaign could be payback for our continued work with ad networks to track, report, and dismantle such attacks.\u201dUsers can protect themselves by keeping their systems fully patched, and by double-checking the identity of any website before clicking on an ad or a link.\u00a0Worried about your cloud security in the work-from-home era?

        "raw text": "A broken Microsoft Windows Defender signature file that was causing system file checks to fail got a patch this week \u2013 but the patch caused an even bigger issue, making Defender user-triggered antivirus scans fail altogether.The issue was in place for about a day before Microsoft re-patched the built-in endpoint protection utility \u2014 but not before a slew of press reports and user complaints shone a bright light on the gaffe.By way of background, the System File Checker (specifically, its administrative prompt \u201csfc/scannow\u201d) had been out of commission since July. SFC is used to find corrupted files and fix them after installing updates. Since the July Patch Tuesday updates though, it had been failing.It turns out that SFC was flagging internal Windows PowerShell files within Defender (Microsoft\u2019s ) as malformed.The system essentially responded to this with a \u201cdoes not compute\u201d reaction, causing SFC to cancel itself. In August, the computer giant issued a notice, explaining that \u201cthe System File Checker (SFC) tool flags files that are located in the %windir%\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\\Defender folder as corrupted or damaged. When this issue occurs, you see error entries that resemble the following: Hashes for file member do not match.\u201dThe fix for that bug was issued on Tuesday in a silent update \u2013 but that update ended up causing manual or scheduled Defender malware scans to fail if the \u201cQuick\u201d or \u201cFull\u201d scan options were selected \u2013 causing users to take to online forums to report the bug. Real-time scanning was still enabled; and the \u201cCustom\u201d scan option, where users can choose the folders they want to be checked, was also still working, according to reports.The issue caused some commentators to point out that Microsoft is building a reputation for breaking things when trying to fix them:Oh look\u2026 #WindowsUpdate strikes again. The CPU spikes, the battery drain issues, and a few other things from the last month still haven't been cleaned up and now this\u2026 #Win10 stick a fork in it\u2026https://t.co/yPxwE3bm9J\u2014 Jason Falter \u2694\ufe0f (@JasonFalter) September 18, 2019The issue has been resolved in the Security Intelligence Update for Windows Defender Antivirus \u2013 KB2267602 (Version 1.301.1684.0).Interested in the role of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, for both offense and defense?

        "raw text": "Never-before-seen Mac malware, dubbed OSX/CrescentCore, has been discovered in the wild. The trojan, spotted on various websites masquerading as an Adobe Flash Player installer, drops malicious applications and browser extensions on victims\u2019 systems when downloaded.OSX/CrescentCore is spread via various websites, where it is\u00a0masqueraded as an Adobe Flash Player installer. However, the \u201cinstaller\u201d is actually a .dmg file (an Apple disk image) that delivers the malware.\u201cOne variant of OSX/CrescentCore was observed dropping potentially unwanted applications, rogue software like OSX/AMC (short for \u2018Advanced Mac Cleaner\u2019),\u201d Joshua Long with Intego told Threatpost on Tuesday. \u201cAnother variant of OSX/CrescentCore tried to install a malicious Safari browser extension.\u201dThe malware was discovered by researchers being distributed via numerous sites \u2013 some of which popped up on Google search results. \u00a0One such site, called \u201cGetComics,\u201d purported to share digital copies of new comic books for free.The malware was also spread via high-ranking Google search results, which were observed redirecting users to multiple sites.\u201cWe were actually in the process of coming up with a name for CrescentCore, and searched for \u2018CrescentCore\u2019 in quotation marks, and one of the links in the first page of search results redirected to a page that happened to be distributing a new sample of CrescentCore,\u201d Long said.The researcher said that oftentimes malware distributors will find vulnerable blogs or other sites with high Google search engine rankings, and add a redirection mechanism that bounces through a number of affiliate links \u2013 \u00a0ultimately redirecting users to a fake Flash Player landing page.\u201cSo if a result for a previously almost unused word like CrescentCore happened to show up in search results, it\u2019s extremely likely that other search results are poisoned with redirections to this malware as well,\u201d he said.After looking further into these search results, researchers found that a page (hosted at any of a large number of domains) was displaying an Adobe Flash Player update warning popup. When clicked, this popup distributed either the new OSX/CrescentCore malware or previously discovered OSX/Shlayer malware.However, \u201cUnlike the typical, everyday, fake Flash Player updater, OSX/CrescentCore has some extra capabilities in an effort to make it more difficult for antivirus software to detect, and more difficult for malware analysts to examine and reverse engineer,\u201d according to Intego\u2019s analysis published last week.Once downloaded the malware touts advanced features allowing it to skirt detection, including the capability to sniff out\u00a0whether it\u2019s running within a virtual machine environment (a common way to check machines for malware) or if antivirus software is present on the machine \u2013 if either are determined, it will simply shut down.\u201cMalware analysts often examine malware inside a VM to avoid unintentionally infecting their own computers while working with dangerous files, so malware authors sometimes implement VM detection and behave differently to make it more difficult to analyze the malware\u2019s behavior,\u201d said researchers.If neither are detected, the malware will then install a LaunchAgent which helps it achieve persistence even further on the infected machine. LaunchAgent, which is a folder that can be installed in Macs\u2019 Library folder that specifies code that should be run every time that user logs in, is commonly utilized by malware to achieve persistence on macOS.The malware is signed using multiple Apple Developer IDs registered to someone named Sanela Lovic; known identifiers so far include 5UA7HW48Y7 and D4AYX8GHJS, said researchers.The malware is only the latest discovered to be targeting Mac systems. Last week, researchers said they have discovered never-before-seen Mac malware samples (OSX/Linker) which they believe are being developed to target a recently-disclosed vulnerability in the MacOS operating system. In May, a bug was disclosed in the macOS security feature Gatekeeper that allows malicious code execution on systems running the most recent version of Mojave (10.14.0).\u201cMac malware developers are actively becoming more clever, attempting to make it harder to detect the malicious nature of their software,\u201d said Long. \u201cAs we learned with OSX/Linker, makers of Mac malware are also experimenting with new ways of bypassing Apple\u2019s built-in protection mechanisms, even attempting to use zero-day vulnerabilities to do so.\u201dMalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have identified a new variant of the SynAck ransomware that is now using the newly identified Process Doppelg\u00e4nging to slip past antivirus programs. Researchers said this is the first ransomware seen in the wild to employ the approach.Both SynAck ransomware and Process Doppelg\u00e4nging are relatively new. The latter was discovered by Ensilo researchers, which presented their research at the London Black Hat 2017 security conference in December. The technique is similar to the hacker method known as Process Hollowing, where adversaries replace the memory of a legitimate process with malicious code, thereby\u00a0 evading antivirus process monitoring tools.With Process Doppelg\u00e4nging, the result is the same; however, attackers abuse Windows NTFS transactions and an outdated implementation of the Windows process loader. \u201cThe main purpose of the technique is to use NTFS transactions to launch a malicious process from the transacted file so that the malicious process looks like a legitimate one,\u201d wrote Anton Ivanov, Fedor Sinitsyn and Orkhan Mamedov, security researchers with Kaspersky Lab, in a co-authored\u00a0technical write-up posted Monday.SynAck ransomware meanwhile first made a splash in Sept. 2017 when cybercriminals used it in an effective campaign to target open or badly-secured RDP connections. More than 100 victims were infected in the short but destructive campaign.Since then, SynAck has matured. This latest sample found by Kaspersky Lab have two noteworthy features added to avoid detection.\u201cFirst, [SynAck] checks if it\u2019s installed in the right directory. If it\u2019s not, it doesn\u2019t run,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cSecond, SynAck checks if it\u2019s installed on a computer with a keyboard set to a certain script \u2014 in this case, Cyrillic \u2014 in which case it also does nothing.\u201d Both of these are attempts by the malware author to avoid running in an antivirus lab environment or on systems from a specific region, such as Russia, Serbia or Ukraine.Kaspersky said those behind SynAck are making use of Process Doppelg\u00e4nging\u2019s non-standard packaging technique to hide malicious code from detection by antivirus software.\u00a0One of the ways to do that is by forgoing the use of custom PE packers to protect the original code of the trojan executable.\u201cThe trojan executable is not packed; instead, it is thoroughly obfuscated prior to compilation. As a result, the task of reverse engineering is considerably more complicated with SynAck than it is with other recent ransomware strains,\u201d researchers wrote.The latest attacks are highly targeted, say researchers, with a limited number of attacks observed against targets in the U.S., Kuwait, Germany and Iran. Ransom demands can be as high as $3,000. Files are encrypted by the AES-256-ECB algorithm with a randomly generated key; and post-encryption, files have randomly generated extensions.\u201cThe ability of the Process Doppelg\u00e4nging technique to sneak malware past the latest security measures represents a significant threat; one that has, not surprisingly, quickly been seized upon by attackers,\u201d Ivanov said, in a statement. \u201cOur research shows how the relatively low-profile, targeted ransomware SynAck used the technique to upgrade its stealth and infection capability.\u201dCryptographyFeaturedHacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Researchers tracking the evolution of the remote access trojan GravityRAT warn that developers behind the malware have made key changes to the RAT\u2019s code in an attempt to decrease antivirus detection.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen file exfiltration, remote command execution capability and anti-vm techniques added throughout the life of GravityRAT. This consistent evolution beyond standard remote code execution is concerning because it shows determination and innovation by the actor,\u201d wrote Cisco Talos researchers Warren Mercer and Paul Rascagneres in a technical write-up posted last week.For the past 18 months, Cisco Talos researchers said they have been tracking GravityRAT with the latest \u201cG2\u201d version spotted two weeks ago. \u00a0The location of the developers, known as \u201cThe Invincible\u201d and \u201cTheMartian,\u201d are unknown. However, researchers said documents used to test anti-virus detection via VirusTotal were submitted from Pakistan.In August, the National Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) of India warned that GravityRAT was being used in targeted attacks against India.GravityRAT\u2019s infection vector is typical: preying on those gullible enough to click on a Word .Docx email attachment and enable macros. By doing so, email recipients are shown a \u201cProtected Document\u201d that prompts targets to \u201cprove that the user is not a robot\u201d (similar to a CAPTCHA). Doing so triggers the infection sequence.Stage one includes a renamed version of the Word .Docx file copied to the targeted system\u2019s Temp directory as a ZIP archive. Next, the infection script decompresses the \u201ctemporary.zip\u201d file and extracts an .EXE binary stored in it. Lastly, a third step includes creating a scheduled task, named \u201cwordtest,\u201d to execute the malicious file every day.\u201cWith this approach, the attacker ensures that there is no direct execution (the executable is executed thanks to scheduled tasks), there\u2019s no download of an additional payload, and finally, the author uses the fact that the .Docx format is an archive in order to include its executable (GravityRAT),\u201d researchers said.Once infected, GravityRAT targets the system\u2019s basic user data and steals .Docx, .Doc, .PPTx, .PPT, .xlsx, .xls, .Rtf and .PDF files. This latest version of the RAT goes further and collects open ports on the victim\u2019s system, lists all the running processes and steals files on any connected USB drive, researchers said.The malware dates back December 2016 with early samples given the version name G1 and later G2. The latest GravityRAT, published in December 2017, is GX.\u201cThis version is the most advanced variant of GravityRAT. Throughout the evolution, we saw this malware embedding open-source legitimate .NET libraries (for schedule tasks, compression, encryption, .NET loading). It contains a resource named \u2018important.\u2019 This is an archive with a password,\u201d researchers said.The RAT has been updated with seven anti-AV detection tools that try to determine if the system is running in a virtual machine environment \u2013 typically used by AV researchers. Tools include a virtual machine detection function that looks for a VM hypervisor. Another tool makes a Windows Management Instrumentation request to check the BIOS version. \u201cIf the response contains: \u2018VMware\u2019, \u2018Virtual\u2019, \u2018XEN\u2019, \u2018Xen\u2019 or \u2018A M I\u2019 the system is considered as a virtual machine,\u201d according to Cisco Talos.Malware attacks via malicious Microsoft Office documents may seem crude, but researchers argue they are still extremely effective and inexpensive compared to more sophisticated attacks. Over the years, the malicious document attacks have flourished, ranging from document files that drop the banking\u00a0trojan Dridex, bots such as\u00a0Kasidet, and Locky\u00a0ransomware.\u00a0Attackers working with the\u00a0BlackEnergy APT group\u00a0were also spotted using Word documents to drop payloads on Ukrainian users.\u201cThis actor is probably not the most advanced actor we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Cisco Talos researchers said.\u00a0The fatal error, they said, was that attackers did not take the time to obfuscate .NET code used in the malware. \u201cThe code was largely trivial to reverse engineer, which meant static analysis was an easy option for this piece of malware.\u201dHacksMalwarePrivacy",

Their customers span over 100 countries (including the United States, despite the FCC labeling Hikvision \u201can unacceptable risk to U.S. national security\u201d in 2019).Last Fall, a command injection flaw in Hikvision cameras was revealed to the world as CVE-2021-36260. The exploit was given a \u201ccritical\u201d 9.8 out of 10 rating by NIST.Despite the severity of the vulnerability, and nearly a year into this story, over 80,000 affected devices remain unpatched. In the time since, the researchers have discovered \u201cmultiple instances of hackers looking to collaborate on exploiting Hikvision cameras using the command injection vulnerability,\u201d specifically in Russian dark web forums, where leaked credentials have been put up for sale.The extent of the damage done already is unclear. The authors of the report could only speculate that \u201cChinese threat groups such as MISSION2025/APT41, APT10 and its affiliates, as well as unknown Russian threat actor groups could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these devices to fulfill their motives (which may include specific geo-political considerations).\u201dThe Risk in IoT DevicesWith stories like this, it\u2019s easy to ascribe laziness to individuals and organizations that leave their software unpatched. But the story isn\u2019t always so simple.According to David Maynor, senior director of threat intelligence at Cybrary, Hikvision cameras have been vulnerable for many reasons, and for a while. \u201cTheir product contains easy to exploit systemic vulnerabilities or worse, uses default credentials. There is no good way to perform forensics or verify that an attacker has been excised. Furthermore, we have not observed any change in Hikvision\u2019s posture to signal an increase in security within their development cycle.\u201dA lot of the problem is endemic to the industry, not just Hikvision. \u201cIoT devices like cameras aren\u2019t always as easy or straightforward to secure as an app on your phone,\u201d Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate with Comparitech, wrote in a statement via email. \u201cUpdates are not automatic; users need to manually download and install them, and many users might never get the message. Furthermore, IoT devices might not give users any indication that they\u2019re unsecured or out of date. Whereas your phone will alert you when an update is available and likely install it automatically the next time you reboot, IoT devices do not offer such conveniences.\u201dWhile users are none the wiser, cybercriminals can scan for their vulnerable devices with search engines like Shodan or Censys. The problem can certainly be compounded with laziness, as Bischoff noted, \u201cby the fact that Hikvision cameras come with one of a few predetermined passwords out of the box, and many users don\u2019t change these default passwords.\u201dBetween weak security, insufficient visibility and oversight, it\u2019s unclear when or if these tens of thousands of cameras will ever be secured.\u00a0IoTPrivacyVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Threat actors are making their way around two-factor authentication (2FA) and using other clever evasion tactics in a recently observed phishing campaign aimed at taking over Coinbase accounts to defraud users of their crypto balances.Attackers are using emails that spoofed the popular cryptocurrency exchange to trick users into logging into their accounts so they could gain access to them and steal victim funds, researchers from PIXM Software have found.\u201cThey will typically distribute these funds through a network of \u2018burner\u2019 accounts in an automated fashion via hundreds or thousands of transactions, in an effort to obfuscate the original wallet from their destination wallet,\u201d the PIXM Threat Research Team explained in a blog post published Thursday.\u00a0Coinbase is a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange platform that\u2019s been around since 2012. It\u2019s arguably one of the most mainstream crypto exchanges, with more than 89 million users, and thus an attractive target for cybercriminals.Clever Evasion TacticsAttackers employ a range of tactics to avoid detection, including one researchers call \u201cshort lived domains\u201d\u2014in which the domains used in the attack \u201cstay alive for extremely short periods of time\u201d\u2013that deviates from typical phishing practices, researchers wrote.\u201cOur estimates place a majority of the pages at being available on the internet for less than two hours,\u201d which in some cases did not even allow PIXM researchers to perform desired forensics once they were alerted to an attack.This, among other techniques like context awareness and 2-factor relay, allow attackers \u201cto keep prying eyes from digging into their phishing infrastructure,\u201d researchers noted.Context awareness in particular is a stealthy tactic because, like short-lived domains, it makes it difficult for security researchers to follow-up after the fact by obfuscating phishing pages, according to PIXM.This tactic allows adversaries to know either the IP, CIDR Range, or Geo-Location from which they anticipate their target or targets to be connecting. They can then create something like an Access Control List (ACL) on the phishing page to restrict connections to only be allowed from the IP, range, or region of their intended target, researchers said.\u201cEven if one of these pages was detected or reported within the few-hour window that the site is live, a researcher would need to spoof the restrictions placed on the page to be able to access the site,\u201d researchers wrote.Phishing for Account Takeover The attacks begin with actors targeting Coinbase users with a malicious email that spoofs the currency exchange so potential victims think it\u2019s a legitimate message.The email uses a variety of reasons to urge the user to log into his or her account, claiming it\u2019s either been locked due to suspicious activity or a transaction needs to be confirmed, researchers said.As is typical with phishing campaigns, if users follow the message directive, they arrive at a fake login page and are prompted to enter their credentials. If that happens, the attacker receives the credentials in real time, and uses them to log in to the legitimate Coinbase website.This is when threat actors employ 2-factor relay in the attack structure to get around the MFA built into the Coinbase platform, researchers said.The attacker\u2019s action prompts Coinbase to send a 2FA code to the victim, who thinks that the notification was prompted by entering credentials into the fake log-in page. Once the user enters the 2FA code into the fake website, the attacker immediately receives it and logs into the legitimate account, thus gaining account control.Diverting Funds to Threat ActorsOnce the threat actor has access to the account, he or she proceeds to divert the user\u2019s funds to the aforementioned network of accounts via a multitude of transactions in an effort to evade detection or raise suspicious.\u201cThese funds are also often embezzled through unregulated illicit online crypto services, like cryptocurrency casinos, betting applications, and illegal online marketplaces,\u201d researchers added.Meanwhile, at this point the unwitting victim will see a message informing them that his or her account has been locked or restricted\u2013not unlike the initial phishing email that prompted the entire malicious transaction. They are prompted to chat with customer service to resolve the problem, and a chat box appears on the right hand corner of the page for them to do this.This prompt is actually the second phase of the attack, in which the threat actor impersonates a Coinbase employee helping the person recover his or her account, asking for various personal and account information. However, really, attackers are buying time so they can complete the fund transfer before the victim becomes suspicious, researchers said.\u201cThey are using this chat session to keep the target occupied and distracted (from potential emails or texts they may be receiving from Coinbase when the transfers are initiated) while they transfer their funds,\u201d they wrote.Once the funds transfer is complete, the attacker will close the chat session abruptly and shut down the phishing page, leaving the Coinbase user confused and soon to realize he or she has been completely defrauded, they said.\u00a0HacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "While ethical hacking is by no means a new or groundbreaking practice, the scale at which organizations and individuals are undertaking such initiatives continues to intensify, especially considering recent events such as the log4j vulnerability.Traditionally, ethical hacking is undertaken by organizations who are looking to uncover security gaps which exist within their corporate network and on company devices. It is a process which can help identify areas in need of immediate patching or remediation, ultimately reducing attack surface and keeping company data safe from ill-intended attackers. However, this is only one advantage to ethical hacking. Another benefit is the education and upskilling of cybersecurity professionals.As someone who has spent the last two decades creating content to help educate the wider cybersecurity community on the latest risks and threats, I can honestly say that one of the biggest challenges that persists in our industry is continuing to accelerate the learning path of cybersecurity professionals, beyond university and self-education. The reality is that cybersecurity textbooks become outdated almost immediately.New technologies with unique security controls emerge and cybercriminals continue to grow in number and become more discrete and targeted. That is why we must constantly learn and upskill ourselves to be able to defend organizations against these attackers and this is where the gamification of ethical hacking can come into play.Keep IT and Security Teams on Their ToesGamified ethical hacking programs and software are instrumental tools for organizations that can help keep IT and security teams sharp and quick on their feet when it comes to identifying and resolving potential threats. Gamified platforms are interactive yet challenging, often requiring participants to think outside of the box. By learning through trial and error, users of ethical hacking platforms often retain skills better than those who participate in textbook training with a series of checkbox exercises.So, how can organizations use hacking gamification to improve and enhance the skills of their security team?One of the greatest things about gamified hacking platforms is that they can help improve security skills and experience in specific and highly targeted areas. For example, organizations can plan education tracks in areas such as incident response, Windows privilege escalation, cloud security, and digital forensics or anywhere else where knowledge gaps may persist.The creation of different internal gamified \u2018capture the flag\u2019 type contests for security teams can also help improve the skill set of company developers and SOC analysts. These events can again be tailored to address specific areas. Not only are these events educational but also serve as fun and interactive team building exercises.Another great, yet often untapped, way to use gamified platforms to your advantage is through the recruitment, onboarding and subsequent training process. Gamification platforms can help organizations quickly determine the skills and capabilities of potential candidates, while also providing a cost-effective and resourceful way to train new hires. By stimulating vulnerabilities in these controlled, gamified environments, employees can put their skills to the test and practice reducing risks in real time.Bridge Skill GapsAs organizations tap gamified hacking platforms to help with their ongoing skills gap, over the past few years, we have also seen hacking become somewhat of an e-sport.Online gamers and streamers on platforms like YouTube are a global phenomenon on social media with viewers wanting to know their secret techniques on how to advance to the next level.\u00a0 Popularity is continuing, with top gamers raking in millions in commissions and sponsorships. Hacking is now following a similar path. Some of the world\u2019s top hackers are now streaming their hacking skills online, showing off new techniques and methods on how to bypass security and get through the initial foothold, and then elevating privileges. Hackers are also competing with one another on interactive platforms, searching for L33T status by being on the top of the leaderboard.\u00a0 This is definitely a new trend that will continue to proliferate this year, and we may even eventually see hacking become an EL3T3 Sport that viewers will pay to watch hacker\u2019s hack.Gamified platforms and hacking esports are the future. This will create a whole new way to train and better prepare security teams to deal with future cyber threats as it allows an organization\u2019s security team to practice and learn the same techniques used by cybercriminals.\u00a0 These platforms will also be used to help find talented professionals who will help your organization defend against cyber attacks.Joseph Carson is Chief Security Scientist and Advisory CISO at\u00a0ThycoticCentrify.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.\u00a0InfoSec Insider",

        "raw text": "High-end audio-tech specialist Bose has disclosed a ransomware attack, which it said rippled \u201cacross Bose\u2019s environment\u201d and resulted in the possible exfiltration of employee data.The incident began on March 7, according to a disclosure letter sent to the Attorney General\u2019s Office in New Hampshire, which kicked off a successful incident-response process, the company said. While the letter didn\u2019t mention how much the ransom was, a company spokeswoman confirmed to media that Bose declined to pay up and instead was able to rely on its own resources to regain control of its environment.\u201cBose initiated incident-response protocols, activated its technical team to contain the incident, and hardened its defenses against unauthorized activity,\u201d according to the letter, sent more than two months after the incident. \u201cIn conjunction with expert third-party forensics providers, Bose further initiated a comprehensive process to investigate the incident. Given the sophistication of the attack, Bose carefully, and methodically, worked with its cyber-experts to bring its systems back online in a safe manner.\u201dAs is the case with many modern ransomware attacks, the cyberattackers may have purloined company data to ratchet up the pressure on the headphone- and speaker-maker. They were able to access HR files for six former employees, which included names, Social-Security numbers and compensation-related information, the team determined \u2013 but it\u2019s unclear whether the data was successfully stolen.\u201cThe forensics evidence at our disposal demonstrates that the threat actor interacted with a limited set of folders within these files,\u201d the letter explained, adding that it couldn\u2019t confirm the state of exfiltration one way or another.\u201cBose has engaged experts to monitor the Dark Web for any indications of leaked data,\u201d the company said. \u201cBose has not received any indication through May 19, 2021 its monitoring activities or from impacted employees that the data discussed herein has been unlawfully disseminated, sold, or otherwise disclosed.\u201dThe company added that it notified the affected individuals of the data-compromise issue, which was discovered April 29.\u201cThere are both some positives and negatives to how they handled the communication to affected individuals,\u201d Kevin Dunne, president at Pathlock, told Threatpost. \u201cOn the positive, they acknowledged the attack, contacted the affected individuals directly, and offered up a small concession (12 months of identity protection). What lacked in the Bose response was faster response time, as more than 60 days passed between when the breach was detected and when the affected individuals were notified. Additionally, they could have taken more responsibility for the attack and laid out a clear plan for how they would prevent these future attacks from happening.\u201dJack Mannino, CEO at nVisium, added that Bose should be applauded for transparency.\u201cThe hard requirement for reporting depends on many things including industry, location, compliance scope, and the breach\u2019s impact,\u201d he said. \u201cCompanies that are forthcoming about breaches, and demonstrate a genuine desire to harden their defenses proactively, avoid some of the scrutiny that inevitably comes when an organization attempts to construct their own narratives based on limited public information.\u201dRemediating the Ransomware AttackDuring and after the attack, Bose said that it implemented the following measures:Enhanced malware/ransomware protection on endpoints and servers to further enhance our protection against future malware/ransomware attacks;Performed detailed forensics analysis on impacted server to analyse the impact of the malware/ransomware;Blocked the malicious files used during the attack on endpoints to prevent further spread of the malware or data exfiltration attempt;Enhanced monitoring and logging to identify any future actions by the threat actor or similar types of attacks;Blocked newly identified malicious sites and IPs linked to this threat actor on external firewalls to prevent potential exfiltration;Changed passwords for all end users and privileged users;And changed access keys for all service accounts.Ransomware World: Maturing and ChangingIt\u2019s unclear which ransomware gang hit Bose, but the process of exfiltrating information under cover of the ransomware attack itself is increasingly common. This so-called \u201cdouble-extortion\u201d approach has given way to a new wrinkle called \u201ctriple extortion,\u201d where crooks lock up files, steal data and also steal the data of partners and suppliers of the victim company.The economy of ransomware continues to mature too \u2013 so much so that many Dark Web forums where ransomware operators sell their wares have implemented a kind of \u201cPeople\u2019s Court\u201d to dispute claims and wrongdoings. Affiliates can file a claim and have their time in front of a jury.\u201cRansomware attacks are on the rise and evolving into a very dangerous digital weapon,\u201d said Joseph Carson, chief security scientist and advisory CISO at ThycoticCentrify, told Threatpost. \u201cNot only are they on the rise, they are becoming more successful, more damaging and the ransom demands are increasing into tens of millions of dollars.\u00a0 Ransomware and data theft continues to be the biggest threats to organizations around the world and no one is immune.\u201dJoin Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cA Walk On The Dark Side: A Pipeline Cyber Crisis Simulation\u201d\u2013 a LIVE interactive demo on\u00a0Wed, June 9 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "No surprise here: The holidays bought no Log4Shell relief.Threat actors vigorously launched exploit attempts and testing during the last weeks of December, Microsoft said on Monday, in the latest update to its landing page and guidance around the flaws in Apache\u2019s Log4j logging library.\u201cWe have observed many existing attackers adding exploits of these vulnerabilities in their existing malware kits and tactics, from coin miners to hands-on-keyboard attacks,\u201d according to Microsoft.This comes on the heels of news that relentless Log4Shell attacks have come from nation-state actors that are both testing and have already implemented the exploit: As of Dec. 15, more than 1.8 million attacks, against half of all corporate networks, using at least 70 distinct malware families, had already been launched to exploit the bugs.What is Log4Shell?The remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in Apache Log4j 2 \u2013 CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-44832 \u2013 are collectively referred to as Log4Shell. Within hours of the initial flaw\u2019s public disclosure on Dec. 10, attackers were scanning for vulnerable servers and unleashing quickly evolving attacks to drop coin-miners, Cobalt Strike, the Orcus remote access trojan (RAT), reverse bash shells for future attacks, Mirai and other botnets, and backdoors.The new attack vector presented by Log4Shell is vast, severe and has ample potential for widespread exploitation. The flaw, which is uber-easy to exploit, is resident in the ubiquitous Java logging library Apache Log4j and could allow unauthenticated RCE and complete server takeover.Within three days of the flaw\u2019s disclosure, it was spitting out mutations. Within 10 days, the notorious Conti ransomware gang had created a holistic Log4Shell attack chain. As of last week, Dec. 30, the advanced persistent threat (APT) Aquatic Panda was targeting universities with Log4Shell exploit tools in an attempt to steal industrial intelligence and military secrets.Obfuscated HTTP RequestsMost recently, Microsoft has observed attackers obfuscating the HTTP requests made against targeted systems. Those requests generate a log using Log4j 2 that leverages Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) to perform a request to the attacker-controlled site. The vulnerability then causes the exploited process to reach out to the site and execute the payload.Microsoft has observed many attacks in which the attacker-owned parameter is a DNS logging system, intended to log a request to the site to fingerprint the vulnerable systems. The crafted string that enables Log4Shell exploitation contains \u201cjndi,\u201d following by the protocol \u2013 such as \u201cldap,\u201d \u201cldaps\u201d \u201crmi,\u201d \u201cdns,\u201d \u201ciiop,\u201d or \u201chttp\u201d \u2013 and then the attacker domain.But to evade detection, attackers are mixing up the request patterns: For example, Microsoft has seen exploit code written that runs a lower or upper command within the exploitation string. Even more complicated obfuscation attempts are being made to try to bypass string-matching detections, such as that shown in the string sample below:Minecraft Servers Still Being ExploitedExploitation continues on non-Microsoft-hosted Minecraft servers, the company said: as in, the same type of servers where Log4j was first discovered.Microsoft confirmed public reports of Khonsari ransomware being delivered as payload post-exploitation, as Bitdefender has detailed. Microsoft Defender antivirus data has shown a small number of cases being launched from compromised Minecraft clients connected to modified Minecraft servers running a vulnerable version of Log4j 2 via the use of a third-party Minecraft mods loader, the company said.\u201cIn these cases, an adversary sends a malicious in-game message to a vulnerable Minecraft server, which exploits CVE-2021-44228 to retrieve and execute an attacker-hosted payload on both the server and on connected vulnerable clients,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cWe observed exploitation leading to a malicious Java class file that is the Khonsari ransomware, which is then executed in the context of javaw.exe to ransom the device.\u201dWhile Minecraft isn\u2019t commonly installed in enterprise networks, Microsoft has nonetheless also observed PowerShell-based reverse shells being dropped to Minecraft client systems via the same malicious message technique, enabling an actor to fully take over a compromised system, which they then use to run Mimikatz to steal credentials.\u201cThese techniques are typically associated with enterprise compromises with the intent of lateral movement,\u201d Microsoft said, meaning that the goal in targeting of Minecraft users, who tend to be children, seems unclear. It\u2019s early yet in this campaign: There hasn\u2019t yet been detectible follow-on activity yet, \u201cindicating that the attacker may be gathering access for later use.\u201dMicrosoft urged Minecraft customers running their own servers to deploy the latest Minecraft server update and for players to exercise caution by only connecting to trusted Minecraft servers.Nation-State ActivityMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) has also observed the CVE-2021-44228 flaw being used by multiple tracked nation-state activity groups originating from China, Iran, North Korea and Turkey.The actors are experimenting during development, integrating the vulnerabilities to in-the-wild payload deployment, and sending exploitations against targets.One example: MSTIC has observed the ransomware-wielding, Iranian Phosphorus\u00a0actor \u2013 aka Charming Kitten, TA453, APT35, Ajax Security Team, NewsBeef or Newscaster, et al. \u2013 acquiring and making modifications of the Log4j exploit.\u201cWe assess that Phosphorus has operationalized these modifications,\u201d Microsoft observed.MSTIC has also seen the China-linked Hafnium group using the vulnerability to attack virtualization infrastructure in order to extend the group\u2019s typical targeting. \u201cIn these attacks, Hafnium-associated systems were observed using a DNS service typically associated with testing activity to fingerprint systems,\u201d researchers noted.Microsoft\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m-a-broken-record\u201d advice: Update affected products and services, and apply security patches ASAP.\u201cWith nation-state actors testing and implementing the exploit and known ransomware-associated access brokers using it, we highly recommend applying security patches and updating affected products and services as soon as possible,\u201d Microsoft said.RAT InfestationMicrosoft is also seeing additional remote-access toolkits and reverse shells being dropped via exploitation of CVE-2021-44228, which is malware that actors use for hands-on-keyboard attacks. Besides the Cobalt Strike beacons and PowerShell reverse shells seen in earlier reports, the company has also seen Meterpreter, Bladabindi and HabitsRAT.\u201cFollow-on activities from these shells have not been observed at this time, but these tools have the ability to steal passwords and move laterally,\u201d Microsoft noted.The activity is coming from small-scale, possibly more targeted attacks (possibly related to testing campaigns), the software giant said. Also, researchers have observed the addition of CVE-2021-44428 to existing campaigns that were exploiting vulnerabilities to drop remote access tools. Microsoft said that the HabitsRAT campaign overlapped with infrastructure used in prior campaigns.Other Log4Shell DevelopmentsMicrosoft has also seen:Multiple ransomware access brokers using the vulnerability to gain initial access to target networks \u2013 access that they sell to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliates. \u201cWe have observed these groups attempting exploitation on both Linux and Windows systems, which may lead to an increase in human-operated ransomware impact on both of these operating system platforms,\u201d Microsoft said.Mass scanning by both attackers and security researchers. The vulnerability has rapidly gotten sucked up into existing botnets like Mirai, existing campaigns previously targeting vulnerable Elasticsearch systems to deploy cryptocurrency miners, and activity deploying the Tsunami backdoor to Linux systems. \u201cMany of these campaigns are running concurrent scanning and exploitation activities for both Windows and Linux systems, using Base64 commands included in the JDNI:ldap:// request to launch bash commands on Linux and PowerShell on Windows,\u201d the company said.No big spikes in ransomware attacks. True, ransomware has been delivered via modified Minecraft clients, but so far it\u2019s been only a small number of cases. That could change, given that access brokers associated with RaaS affiliates are folding the vulnerability into their initial-access toolkits. But Microsoft is also seeing older ransomware payloads in limited use by security researchers and a small number of attackers. \u201cIn some instances, they appear to be experimenting with deployments via scanning and modified Minecraft servers,\u201d Microsoft said. \u201cAs part of these experiments, some ransomware payloads seem to have been deployed to systems that were previously compromised and were originally dropping coin-miner payloads.\u201dWebtoos Malware. Webtoos, a malware with distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) capabilities and persistence mechanisms that could allow an attacker to wreak yet more havoc, is also being deployed via the Log4Shell vulnerability. \u201cAttackers\u2019 use of this malware or intent is not known at this time, but the campaign and infrastructure have been in use and have been targeting both Linux and Windows systems prior to this vulnerability,\u201d Microsoft said.Microsoft\u2019s post has extensive advice on attack vectors and observed activity, finding and remediating vulnerable apps and systems, detecting and responding to exploitation attempts and other related attacker activity, and indicators of compromise (IoCs).This Is Just the StartAs if all that weren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s all likely going to get worse, Microsoft said. Just like Log4j is tucked away into nooks and crannies, so too are exploits going to get added to yet more attacker toolkits: \u201cThe majority of attacks we have observed so far have been mainly mass scanning, coin-mining, establishing remote shells and red-team activity, but it\u2019s highly likely that attackers will continue adding exploits for these vulnerabilities to their toolkits,\u201d Microsoft said.How Do You Even Know Where Log4J Is Lurking?A massive part of the Log4Shell nightmare is the fact that it\u2019s not always obvious which software is using a vulnerable version of the Log4j library.While Microsoft has laid out several methods for detecting active exploit attempts using Log4j, identifying the vulnerable version before an attack would be \u201cideal,\u201d according to Ray Kelly, a fellow at NTT Application Security.\u201cThis will be a continuing battle for both consumers and vendors going forward into 2022 in what will need to be a two-pronged approach,\u201d Kelly told Threatpost. \u201cSecurity vendors have been quick on the response for consumers by adding log4j rules that enable DAST [dynamic application security scanning] scanners to detect if a website can be exploited with a malicious log4j web request against a company\u2019s web server. At the same time, vendors must ensure that they are not shipping software with the vulnerable version using tools such as SCA [service component architecture].\u201dAsking What to Do? It\u2019s a Little Late for ThatJake Williams, co-founder and CTO at BreachQuest, echoed Microsoft\u2019s assertion that this vulnerability will have an extremely long tail for exploitation, considering that many organizations don\u2019t even realize they\u2019re running vulnerable software.\u201cUnfortunately (and nobody wants to hear this), there\u2019s nothing left to say about remediating log4j that hasn\u2019t already been said hundreds of times,\u201d Williams told Threatpost. \u201cAny organization asking today what they need to do regarding log4j almost certainly has an incident on their hands. Every organization with a security team knows what needs to be done to hunt down log4j, they just need the resources and political backing to actually get it done. Being exploited through an internet-facing system running vulnerable log4j at this point is a leadership failure, not a technical one.\u201dPassword\u00a0Reset:\u00a0On-Demand Event: Fortify 2022 with a password-security strategy built for today\u2019s threats.

The solicitation for contract laid out nebulous objectives to \u201cmonitor the health and well-being of children\u201d at the childcare center.The paperwork did detail cybersecurity parameters, which includes an interconnection agreement, adherence to the Department of Defense cybersecurity regulations and a requirement that any data stored be encrypted.Other requirements include following the Security Technical Guides (STIGs), submission to Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for source code analysis, and an obligation to provide patching and mitigation support.Facial-recognition software has regularly come under fire by security professionals and privacy advocates alike. Not only have facial-recognition algorithms been easily fooled, they\u2019ve been decried as a privacy nightmare by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to the Department of Homeland Security in March 2020 over its use of facial recognition in airports. Just months later, Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.), both Democrats, introduced the National Biometric Information Privacy Act in an effort to curb the government\u2019s ability to collect peoples\u2019 biometric data.The Fort Jackson pilot program is scheduled to run for a year, according to the request for bids. Designs are due in 120 days and should be installed and operational within 8 months, the schedule said.

        "raw text": "A so-called \u201cpen-tester\u201d for the financial cybergang known as FIN7 will spend seven years in the slammer after being convicted for payment-card theft.According to the Department of Justice, Andrii Kolpakov, a Ukrainian national, was also ordered to pay a tidy $2.5 million in restitution for his crimes.FIN7 (aka Carbanak Group or Navigator Group) is a well-known threat that\u2019s been circulating since at least 2015. The group typically uses malware-laced phishing attacks against victims in hopes they will be able to infiltrate systems to steal bank-card data and sell it. It has also become well-known for targeting point-of-sale (PoS) systems at casual-dining restaurants, casinos and hotels. Since 2020, it has also added ransomware/data exfiltration attacks to its mix, carefully selecting targets according to revenue using the ZoomInfo service.As for Kolpakov, he was sentenced on Thursday in the Western District of Washington after pleading guilty last year in June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.According to documents filed in the case, he served as a high-level hacker for FIN7, often referred to as a penetration tester by the group \u2013 i.e., someone who looks for weaknesses in a target\u2019s security defenses. He also managed other hackers tasked with breaching the security of victims\u2019 computer systems, the DoJ said.\u201cDuring the course of the scheme, Kolpakov received compensation for his participation in FIN7, which far exceeded comparable legitimate employment in Ukraine,\u201d according to the announcement. Moreover, FIN7 members, including Kolpakov, were aware of reported arrests of other FIN7 members, but nevertheless continued to attack U.S. businesses.\u201dHe was arrested in Lepe, Spain, back in June 2018 and extradited to the U.S. in June 2019.FIN7\u2019s Trail of Carnage: $1B in Customer Losses\u201cMembers of FIN7\u2026engaged in a highly sophisticated malware campaign to attack hundreds of U.S. companies, predominantly in the restaurant, gambling and hospitality industries,\u201d according to the DoJ\u2019s announcement on Thursday. \u201cFIN7 hacked into thousands of computer systems and stole millions of customer credit- and debit-card numbers that were then used or sold for profit. FIN7, through its dozens of members, launched waves of malicious cyberattacks on numerous businesses operating in the United States and abroad.\u201dIn fact, in the U.S. alone, FIN7 stole more than 20 million customer card records from more than 6,500 individual PoS terminals at more than 3,600 separate business locations, in all 50 states, according to the DoJ. The total haul in terms of victim losses exceeded $1 billion. High-profile victims include Arby\u2019s, Chili\u2019s, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Jason\u2019s Deli and Red Robin.The DoJ goes on to describe how FIN7, to gain initial access to a target environment, carefully crafted email messages that \u201cwould appear legitimate to a business\u2019s employees, and accompanied emails with telephone calls intended to further legitimize the emails.\u201dThis is a tactic that the group recently took to an extreme, when it was spotted pushing its signature Carbanak remote-access trojan (RAT) malware under the guise of the package being a tool from cybersecurity stalwarts Check Point Software or Forcepoint.And in May, it surfaced with the Lizar malware, which can harvest all kinds of info from Windows machines. In that case, FIN7 was pretending to be a legitimate organization that hawks Lizar as a Windows pen-testing tool for ethical hackers. They went to great lengths for verisimilitude, researchers said: \u201cThese groups hire employees who are not even aware that they are working with real malware or that their employer is a real criminal group.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET\u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "Apex Laboratory, which provides blood work at home for patients in New York City, Long Island and South Florida, has been hit with a ransomware attack that also resulted in patient data being stolen.Though the company just disclosed the attack, it took place on July 25, when \u201ccertain systems in its environment were encrypted and inaccessible,\u201d according to a website notice from last week.Working with a cybersecurity firm, Apex was able to secure its network and resume operations two days later. But the forensic investigation went on, eventually determining on Dec. 15 that the attackers had posted information on their blog about the attack and claimed to have lifted personal and health information, the company said in a New Year\u2019s Eve notice.That data includes patient names, dates of birth, test results, and for some individuals, Social Security numbers and phone numbers, Apex said. It was likely taken from Apex\u2019s systems between July 21 and July 25 as part of\u00a0 \u00a0a\u00a0\u201cdouble extortion\u201d attack where criminals not only lock up systems but also exfiltrate data.\u201cApex is unaware of any actual or attempted misuse of any information other than the extracting of this data as part of the cyberattack,\u201d the company said. \u201cApex is in the process of preparing written, mailed notice to impacted individuals for whom it has addresses.\u201d It added that the investigation is still ongoing.\u201cWhile the typical ransomware business model involves encrypting data in place and then selling the victim decryption capabilities (aka the ransom), business models always evolve,\u201d Oliver Tavakoli, CTO at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cIn order to maximize the likelihood of getting a targeted organization to pay such ransoms, attackers may choose to impose multiple types of pain \u2013 in this case, the attackers employed both the possible loss of data through encryption as well as the public release of confidential information, thereby getting two bites at the apple. While Apex Laboratory had good enough data backups to overcome the first threat, the second threat was the attacker\u2019s failsafe to still get a ransom.\u201dOther details were scant on the attack, but Threatpost reached out to Apex for more information on the ransomware gang involved and other data.The news comes as healthcare organizations continue to be a top target for ransomware gangs,\u201cI\u2019d say the predominant issue facing healthcare right now is ransomware,\u201d Beau Woods, a Cyber Safety Innovation Fellow with the Atlantic Council, founder and CEO of Stratigos Security and a leader with the I Am The Cavalry grassroots initiative, told Threatpost in a recent video interview. \u201cRansomware continues to be a leading thorn in the side of care delivery, being able to deliver care to patients. ransomware comes in and shuts down clinical operations, it can cause patient care to go on divert, which is where they basically send ambulances to other hospitals, or even cause hospitals to move patients to another facility that\u2019s not impacted by ransomware.\u201dMedical organizations have a unique set of challenges that make them ripe targets, researchers said.\u201cThe healthcare industry has a particularly challenging setting \u2014 they have to prioritize fighting healthcare-related fires all the time and have to work with software (and hardware) that takes years to certify for safety,\u201d Mohit Tiwari, co-founder and CEO at Symmetry Systems, told Threatpost. \u201cThis means the compute infrastructure lags behind due to both business and technical reasons. Healthcare executives need a shift in mindset. They must understand compute infrastructure in hospitals is key to healthcare, and computing failures are healthcare failures. Further, computing flaws are highly correlated and can spread quickly \u2014 ransomware or breach of large data stores \u2014 or compromise of medical equipment on a network.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

Welcome back to the Threatpost news wrap for the week ended September 20. You\u2019ve got Lindsey O\u2019Donnell here with Tara Seals with Threatpost today to talk about the biggest news of the week. Tara, how\u2019s your week been so far?Tara Seals: Oh, it\u2019s been pretty good Lindsey. You know, busy as always, security never sleeps apparently.LO: Well, I know I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been very busy preparing for \u2013 you actually have a webinar next Wednesday, is that right?TS: Yes it\u2019s coming up. And it\u2019s on artificial intelligence and where it fits into cyber security.LO: Yeah, that looks like it will be pretty good. I feel like AI has been at the center of cyber security in terms of tools for protecting against threats. But now, as we start to see, you know, black hats starting to leverage it as well that\u2019s worrisome, and there\u2019s a lot to unpack there.TS: Yeah, for sure. Well, so I have three really great panelists and, I\u2019m excited to hear what they have to say on the on the topic and they\u2019re all taking a different tack. So we\u2019re definitely going to cover the adversarial aspect of it. So you know how black hats are also using AI and how that\u2019s contributing to this cat-and-mouse game, which is the age old security story of course, vendors trying to keep up with attackers as a byproduct of that, it\u2019s forcing artificial intelligence to develop more quickly, maybe then it might have otherwise. And then we\u2019re also going to have a lot in terms of where we\u2019re seeing AI being utilized now, what\u2019s hype and what isn\u2019t, and also where we can expect it to evolve to in the future, what sorts of solutions and different types of products, as well as how it will interface with human resources as well.LO: Right. Well, I\u2019m sure that whole topic around AI and the workforce to is going to be a big topic of\u00a0discussion as well. I think there\u2019s just a lot there and sounds really exciting.TS: So yeah, I know it should be really, really good. I\u2019m looking forward to it. So it\u2019s 2pm ET on Wednesday, next week, September 25.LO: Great. Well, to all our listeners, make sure to mark your calendars and I\u2019ll be sure to include a registration link in our article for this podcast as well. But yeah, I\u2019m definitely excited to listen to that. So going back to this week, big news this week, Emotet is apparently back and that malware has been on hiatus since I think it was earlier in June. So a while but it\u2019s now back and being spotted in campaigns. I feel like a bunch of researchers were kind of expecting that to happen though.TS: Yeah, I think didn\u2019t you do a video interview actually kind of covering Emotet and its various vacillations and how it had disappeared from the radar screen.\u00a0But very much expected to return right?LO: Yeah. So I was actually talking to Sharon DeGrippo with Proofpoint back at Black Hat. And I recently published the video interview of that. But she was mentioning we were talking kind of about the ebb and flow of malware variants and families and how summer going away summer coming onto the scene and summer just disappearing. But she was saying that they\u2019re almost dropping off as the threat actors behind the malware variants, so on vacation, funny enough, so she was saying that the Emotet group probably was on summer vacation, but she was predicting back in August that they were probably going to come back and sure enough, that sounds like this week. that is exactly what people started seeing happen.TS: So yeah, I love it. They did and so I wrote a story by basically on the return of humans had talking about how you know they took a summer vacation. A four months\u00a0long summer vacation, and then you know came back kind of with a vengeance, and with some evolutions, and it\u2019s been the most had tactics as well, which are kind of interesting.One of which, for example, they\u2019re starting to take over existing email threads basically. So if you have correspondence that you\u2019ve been having with someone that you know that\u2019s legitimate correspondence, Emotet can actually go in, find one of those messages and reply to it. So you think that it\u2019s just one more part of an ongoing conversation thread, and your suspicions might not be raised when the person on the other end asks you to take a look at an attached document. So that\u2019s a pretty savvy technique\u00a0that was only found in something like 8 percent of Emotet campaigns before the summer hiatus and now it accounts for almost 25% or a quarter.LO: That\u2019s definitely a newer track and it sounds like it\u2019s very sneaky too so, they have also been, I feel like they\u2019ve been evolving to a bunch over the past year or so. So, you know, it sounds like they\u2019re constantly kind of picking up these new tricks and tactics. Did they have any indication of kind of the targeting there and who specifically was being targeted?TS: Well, you know, it\u2019s kind of a spray and pray type of thing, because with the way that they propagate, the malware is basically via email, right? So they infect somebody, and then they gather the person\u2019s contact list, and then they spam everybody on the contact list. So that\u2019s kind of the propagation angle. So it\u2019s very much just sort of opportunistic and can be targeted at anybody really, you know, the most recent one \u2013 you see it globally \u2013 but the most recent one started out I think they said, in\u00a0Sweden, I believe I don\u2019t have it in front of me.\u00a0No, I\u2019m sorry, in Germany,\u00a0Poland and also and Italy. And then shortly after that it popped up in the US as well all using the same types of wars. So all parts of the campaign but different areas of the globe and certainly not discriminatory in terms of who the targets are.LO: Well, that will definitely be something to keep our eyes on in the coming few months, especially today. We\u2019re kind of on this break and sounds like they are coming back on full force.TS: So yeah, I think it\u2019s kind of funny that you, you know, people forget that this is a full time job for these guys, right? The guys and gals, they they go to work every day and they take vacations too. And they probably have, you know, over time, allotment and everything else. Now a four months summer hiatus. Now, that\u2019s something that I would like to implement here in the US, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get that anytime soon.You have some interesting stories this week too Lindsey like you wrote about, for example, Edward Snowden is back in the headlines.\u00a0Which I thought was interesting.LO: Yeah, he is, essentially what happened was that the US filed a lawsuit against him. And you know, when I first saw that I was kind of when I read the headlines, I was like, what, what is this, like what has happened, but it\u2019s actually for his new memoir, which is not what I thought it would be about, I guess the lawsuit revolves around his book, which is called \u201cPermanent Record.\u201d And that was published on Tuesday. So it outlines kind of his life and his story behind the 2013 incident. What the US said in their lawsuit was that he published the book in violation of non disclosure agreements that were signed with the CIA and with the NSA. And what it sounds like just reading between the lines is that they\u2019re just trying to kind of seize any proceeds going from his memoir. And, they named the publishers of the book as defendants and ordered them to freeze any assets that were\u00a0related to the book. So sounds like they\u2019re dinging him for his memoir. The lawsuit also alleged that Snowden gave public speeches on different matters that were also in violation with his non disclosure agreements, just makes you wonder kind of what he had in place for non disclosure agreements with the US government. I feel like they can\u2019t really do too much about him right now. So they\u2019re really kind of aiming for those publishing companies and trying to freeze those assets in the only way they can really.TS: Yeah, there are a few different things that stick out to me here, first of all, is, you know, I think you mentioned in the article, somebody from the ACLU pointed out that there\u2019s nothing in the book that hasn\u2019t already been published in newspaper accounts and the like. So, first of all, the cat\u2019s already out of the bag. It\u2019s not exactly, you know, government secrets anymore, right.\u00a0There\u2019s that part and I don\u2019t know the veracity of that claim. You know, maybe he did put new information into the book that wasn\u2019t known about that that incident before. But the other thing is, you know, the government\u2019s doing him a favor, right? Basically saying, you know, I think he tweeted out this is the book government doesn\u2019t want you to read, which obviously is gonna be like, Well, I have to go read it right now.LO: It\u2019s so funny you say that because and you mentioned his attorney Ben Wizner was the one with the director of the ACLU speech privacy and technology project and he actually said in his statement, it was almost like a little like snarky a little bit. He was like, Mr. Snowden hopes that today\u2019s lawsuit by the US government will bring the book to the attention of more readers throughout the world not really hiding it between the lines there but anything that\u2019s going to it\u2019s some needed publicity, I guess, but.TS: Well, and even if the judge decides that the publishing companies have to have to abide by this, this freezing order. You know, there will be enough books out there in circulation I\u2019m sure copies will go up on, you know, the black market, like the internet and people will be photocopying it and everything else. I\u2019m not sure that the government\u2019s efforts are going to results that they\u2019re hoping. Right?LO: Yeah, for sure. Well, I am interested in reading the book kind of learning more about it. \u00a0And then another interesting article I wrote about actually, just yesterday on Thursday was \u2013 this was less kind of hard news \u2013 But it was more about physical pen testers because I don\u2019t know if you have been following that news. But there was a case on September 11, where two hackers were arrested and jailed for breaking into the Iowa courthouse during what turned out to be a pen tester exercise. And they were two physical pen testers who were hired by the Iowa judicial branch to make sure that the courts\u2019 data was secure. And that they weren\u2019t able to bypass like physical protections put in place by the bank. But what happened was that there was miscommunication and different interpretations around the scope of the agreement. So the two contractors who worked with a security firm called Coalfire ended up getting arrested and it was a whole mess. And but now it sounds like both of the entities involved, so Coalfire and the Iowa judicial branch, have come out and said, this was all a big misunderstanding, they were part of a physical pen test. And, we apologize about this, and we\u2019re working together to try to figure this out. But it just goes to show first of all, it made me curious about physical pen testing. And second of all, it was really interesting to learn more about kind of there are kind of different interpretations in terms of scope, when it comes to physical pen test agreements, much like there are kind of bug bounty in-scope vulnerabilities and responsible disclosure agreements. So I thought that was kind of an interesting piece of it too. And I actually went and talked to Chris Pritchard with Pen Test Partners, who works as a physical pen tester. And he had a lot of really interesting kind of information about his own day to day work, performing recon, kind of scoping out entry options and looking at how he can physically breach organizations.TS: Yeah, I was reading that story. And one of the things that I left out to me was, you know, when he talks about how you know, so a company will hire him basically to see if they can break in right and get past, social engineer the security staff or whoever\u2019s in charge of preventing access to people that are unknown, correct? So when he was talking about how he gets nerves, you know what ahead of an assignment and having to be that person that\u2019s going up there trying to get by with a fake ID badge or trying to, talk somebody into believing some trumped up story about how he has to gain access to the vending machine because he\u2019s there to, repair it or whatever. It is fascinating, fascinating theme I thought.LO: Yeah, no, and it is interesting. I mean, even though this is a simulation, the fact that he was saying that physical pen testers do get nervous, and they do really want to try to think in the mindset of someone who would be trying to get into an organization because at the end of the day, you\u2019re really trying to help them understand what their weak points are. And a couple of other things that kind of stuck out to me when I was talking to Chris was that he was mentioning that there are different things that he notices even when he\u2019s preparing for entering a building. For example, he will\u00a0\u00a0take note of what people are wearing in an office because if you\u2019re a very dressed down office space and the dress is casual and someone walks in and they\u2019re wearing \u00a0fancy clothes, then you\u2019re going to obviously take note of that. So that was one thing he noticed. Another thing he took note of was obviously the surveillance devices or any locks. And he also said that I asked him kind of what the hardest kinds of organizations to perform a physical pen test engagement were and he actually said airports which was kind of interesting, because I guess just that the knowledge, there\u2019s such a stigma around having high security there, makes kind of that level of nerves go up for a physical pen tester in order to perform that engagement.TS: I think anybody that you know, appreciates Homeland Security and stay on the right side of the law. Doesn\u2019t want to\u00a0tangle with TSA, for example, you know, and I mean, I would be, you know, I\u2019m kind of a rules and regs girl, and I would feel very nervous trying to, it\u2019s just that\u2019s a different order of magnitude. Right?LO: Absolutely. I would be very nervous as well, just with the security teams. They\u2019re on the next level. Yeah.\u00a0And tend to be armed and those types of things. Yeah.TS: Well, one of the questions that I had was do they actually use any cyber security aspects when they do this? Like, for example, I don\u2019t know plant malware on the network or try to physically surveil by hacking the security cameras or anything like that.LO: It really depends on the assignment and\u00a0Chris was telling me that the final task is kind of the first thing that\u2019s agreed upfront. And that could be getting a red folder from the finance office or it could be actually like plugging into the network, plugging in a USB or something looking for vulnerabilities that could compromise the company and trying to see just how far you can get in actually attempting that simulation of a breach. So there definitely is some type of technology aspect and cyber security aspect to it. But I think that is probably after you have gotten through the surveillance camera or like any sort of locks on the door, or getting past different security systems or security guards. So I think it\u2019s kind of a combination of both of them.TS: Really interesting stuff.LO: Yeah, yeah. And I guess my final point would be that he said that he was always on the lookout for a challenge which is when an organization employee would challenge him as someone who shouldn\u2019t be in the office after noticing that he is an intruder. And he said that challenges are really difficult for employees and just kind of regular, you know, organization employees, because it\u2019s essentially going up to a stranger and confronting them, which makes a lot of people uncomfortable. So Chris\u2019s recommendation for challenges is that if you\u2019re an employee and you see someone who\u2019s kind of sticking out or who is new in your office, to confront them in a kind of a non aggressive way. And ask them a question that not like, Who are you? But it might be like, oh, like, you know, What are you here for, and then go and verify that information. And he was saying that the more questions you ask like, the more likely it is that the intruder would trip up or like make a mistake. So and\u00a0once they do slip up, he was saying that you can go and notify\u00a0the right people in your organization. So yeah, it was a really interesting article array, lots to learn there, and really enjoyed talking to Chris.LO: Well, Tara, I think we should probably wrap up. But thank you so much for coming on. It was great talking to you and kind of touching base at the end of the week.TS: Yes. Thanks so much for having me, Lindsay and have a great weekend.LO: Thanks, you too.\u00a0\u00a0PodcastsPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Apple has sued startup Corellium for copyright infringement,\u00a0alleging that the company has developed \u201cexact digital replicas\u201d of its iPhone operating system without authorization \u2013 from the code down to the graphical user interface.While details about Florida-based Corellium on its website are slim, a Forbes report from 2018 said that the company has created virtual software (available via a Corellium web-based platform) simulating iOS and iTunes. Essentially, the company sells access to virtual machines that run the operating system replicas, which can be used as a test bed for hackers and software developers to do anything from testing their apps on various hardware to sniffing out vulnerabilities.However, Apple\u2019s lawsuit claims that Corellium\u2019s true goal is \u201cprofiting off its blatant infringement,\u201d rather than finding security vulnerabilities in its software: \u201cThe purpose of this lawsuit is not to encumber good-faith security research, but to bring an end to Corellium\u2019s unlawful commercialization of Apple\u2019s valuable copyrighted works,\u201d according to Apple\u2019s lawsuit, filed last week\u00a0in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. \u201cAccordingly, Apple respectfully seeks an injunction, along with the other remedies described below, to stop Corellium\u2019s acts of naked copyright infringement.\u201dCorellium\u2019s website does not offer further descriptions of its products or services other than to describe them as \u201cmobile device virtualization: The future of mobile development.\u201d The website\u00a0does tout an intellectual property policy, which says Corellium \u201crespects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same\u201d \u2013 but does not touch directly on Apple software.According to Apple\u2019s lawsuit, Corellium offers licensing for private installations to entities \u2013 installing a full version of its cloud-based product on a customer\u2019s premises \u2013 for $1 million a year. \u201cSuch private installations of the Corellium Apple Product copy, modify and display Apple\u2019s copyrighted works,\u201d Apple said.Apple also expressed concerns over the security testing functionalities of Corellium\u2019s products; the company makes no effort to confine use of its product to good-faith research and testing of iOS, and does not require users to disclose any software bugs discovered to Apple, the lawsuit says.The lawsuit comes after Apple has made important strides around vulnerability disclosure. At Black Hat USA 2019 in August,\u00a0Apple bumped up its bug bounty rewards to include a hefty $1 million payout for finding a network attack with no user interaction that could lead to zero-click kernel code execution with persistence.\u00a0Apple also\u00a0confirmed reports\u00a0that it will give security researchers special iPhones that will make it easier for them to find weaknesses in its smartphone, in a new program called \u201ciOS Security Research Device Program.\u201d The phone will have special features \u2013 such as advanced debug capabilities \u2013 \u00a0and will be available to researchers next year.\u201cApple strongly supports good-faith security research on its platforms, and has never pursued legal action against a security researcher,\u201d Apple said in its lawsuit. \u201cNot only does Apple publicly credit researchers for reporting vulnerabilities, it has created several programs to facilitate such research activity so that potential security flaws can be identified and corrected.\u201dThomas Reed, director of Mac and Mobile for Malwarebytes, told Threatpost that Apple has long defended requirements to run products like macOS only on Apple hardware; For instance, companies like MacStadium that run banks of Mac virtual machines are allowed to do so only if those virtual machines are running on Mac hardware.\u201cBased on this, it\u2019s quite obvious that Apple would sue Corellium based on its service that offers remotely hosted iOS virtual machines, which are not running on Apple hardware,\u201d he said. \u201cI would guess that it is a certainty that Apple will be able to prevent Corellium from continuing to provide this service.However, \u201con the other hand, I really wish there were some way Corellium could work out a deal with Apple to continue providing this service. It would be quite useful, not just for security researchers and jailbreakers, but also for iOS developers,\u201d said Reed. \u201cFrom what I hear, Corellium\u2019s service is far superior to Apple\u2019s Simulator app for iOS developers.\u201dCorellium did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Threatpost.Interested in more on the internet of things (IoT)?

        "raw text": "A group of well-known genetic testing providers have partnered with the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) to establish privacy guidelines for handling information about what is arguably the most personal private information there is: DNA.Consumer-grade DNA testing \u2013 i.e., services that allow folks at home to swab or spit into a mail-in test kit to find out about their heritage, health predispositions and more \u2013 has been enjoying a boom, helped along by TV advertising blitzes and savvy marketing positioning as the perfect gift for any relative. Those wanting to find out, say, just how celebratory they should get on St. Patrick\u2019s Day, or whether they should be concerned about diabetes, are asked to give permission for researchers to delve into their personal genetic profile. But what happens to that information beyond that? How is it being used and protected?These are important questions, given recent high-profile data breaches at Ancestry and MyHeritage, in particular. The former discovered a public file on a RootsWeb.com server in December containing 300,000 passwords, email addresses and usernames (7,000 of which were for active accounts); while the latter gained the distinction of seeing the largest breach since Equifax, when it found account data tied to 92 million users of service on a third-party \u201cprivate\u201d server, back in June.Both Ancestry and MyHeritage, along with 23andMe, African Ancestry, Habit, Helix and others, committed to the Privacy Best Practices for Consumer Genetic Testing Services this week, which provides a policy framework for the collection, protection, sharing and use of genetic data \u2013 starting with an effort at placing controls around how and when a person\u2019s DNA information can be used. Taking a page from the recently implemented GDPR in Europe, the policy also calls for detailed transparency about how genetic data is collected, used, shared and retained, including ensuring that a high-level summary of key privacy protections is posted publicly and made easily accessible to consumers.The document includes a requirement for separate express consent for the sharing and transfer of genetic data to third parties like employers, insurance companies, educational institutions and government agencies; being clear about access, correction and deletion rights; providing educational resources about what the testing specifically does; and clearly outlining the circumstances under which DNA information can be provided to law enforcement (with transparency reporting on at least an annual basis). It also calls for \u201cstrong data security protections and privacy by design,\u201d and limits on marketing based on DNA.Consumer genetic testing is becoming more accessible than ever before, with prices coming down, test results arriving quicker and more services entering the market, which makes these considerations ever more important. What many consumers don\u2019t realize (accustomed as we are to trading sensitive data for convenience or information without reading the fine print), is that the testing isn\u2019t constrained by HIPAA regulations (direct to consumer testing companies are not considered \u201ccovered entities\u201d under the healthcare privacy law, according to the EFF), only individual companies\u2019 own privacy policies; nor do many recognize exactly how valuable the information can be.\u201cThe Best Practices recognize that genetic data is sensitive information that warrants a high standard of privacy protection,\u201d said Carson Martinez, policy fellow at FPF. \u201cGenetic data may be used to identify predispositions and potential risk for future medical conditions; may reveal information about the individual\u2019s family members, including future children; may contain unexpected information or information of which the full impact may not be understood at the time of collection; and may have cultural significance for groups or individuals. It is therefore critical that the appropriate level of privacy protections is implemented.\u201dPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Mozilla has made some sweeping security announcements this week: On Monday, the company announced it is testing a new security tool called Firefox Monitor, which the firm said securely checks to see if users\u2019 accounts have been hacked. That news came just as the browser giant released Firefox 61 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android.The testing of Firefox Monitor also comes on the heels of Mozilla\u2019s partnership with Cloudflare and Have I Been Pwned (HIBP).Similar to the existing function of HIBP, founded by security researcher Troy Hunt, Firefox Monitor allows users to enter their email addresses to check if they\u2019re part of hacker databases that have been publicly released.\u201cIn order to help keep personal information and accounts safe, we will be testing user interest in a security tool that lets users check if one of their accounts has been compromised in a data breach,\u201d Peter Dolanjski, product manager for Firefox, said in a post. \u201cWe decided to address a growing need for account security by developing Firefox Monitor, a proposed security tool that is designed for everyone, but offers additional features for Firefox users.\u201dFirefox Monitor users can see the details on sites and other sources of breaches and the types of personal data exposed in each breach, and receive recommendations on what to do in the case of a data breach.Mozilla said it is also considering a service to notify people when new breaches include their personal data.\u201cThis is major, because Firefox has an install base of hundreds of millions of people which\u00a0significantly\u00a0expands the audience that can be reached once this feature rolls out to the mainstream,\u201d Hunt said in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m really happy to see Firefox integrating with HIBP in this fashion, not just to get it in front of as many people as possible, but because I have a great deal of respect for their contributions to the technology community.\u201dAt a technical level, the Firefox Monitor service will use anonymized range query API endpoints from HIBP \u2013 allowing users to preserve their privacy while they check for compromised accounts. These API endpoints were designed and implemented by Cloudflare as an additional layer of security for those consuming the API that is visible to the end users.\u201cThis contribution allows for\u00a0Pwned Passwords\u00a0clients to use\u00a0range queries\u00a0to search for breached passwords, without having to disclose a complete unsalted password hash to the service,\u201d said Cloudflare\u2019s Junade Ali, in a post.Mozilla said currently it is testing initial designs of the Firefox Monitor tool \u2013 but beginning next week, the company will invite approximately 250,000 users, mainly U.S.-based, to try it out.\u201cOnce we\u2019re satisfied with user testing, we will work on making the service available to all Firefox users,\u201d said Dolanjski in the post. \u201cOnce a release schedule has been established, it will be announced in a follow-up blog post.\u201dFirefox 61\u00a0 Launch Mozilla on Tuesday also released Firefox 61 for Windows, Mac, Linux and Android, with new security features.Most notably, the new Firefox version will block sub-resource loads that rely on the insecure File Transfer Protocol (FTP), unless the document itself is an FTP document.\u201cThe fundamental underlying problem with FTP is that any data transferred will be unencrypted and hence sent across networks in plain text, allowing attackers to steal, spoof and even modify the data transmitted,\u201d said Christoph Kerschbaumer, content security tech lead at Mozilla in a post.\u201cFollowing through to our intent to deprecate non-secure HTTP and aligning with Mozilla\u2019s effort to improve adoption of HTTPS Firefox will block subresource loads, like images, scripts and iframes, relying on the insecure FTP protocol,\u201d he continued.The new version of Firefox also offers default support for the latest draft of the Transport Layer Security specification.The new version will support TLS 1.3, which succeeds the Secure Socks Layer (SSL) protocol as the new standard for enabling two networked applications or devices to exchange information privately. It was first drafted more than four years ago, in April 2014, by the Internet Engineering Task Force.Users can view the release notes on Mozilla\u2019s homepage.PrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Account data tied to 92 million users of the genealogy and DNA testing service MyHeritage were found on a third-party \u201cprivate\u201d server in a breach that exposed usernames and passwords of customers.The breach is the largest since last year\u2019s Equifax leak of 147.9 million pieces of private data ranging from Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and some driver\u2019s license numbers.Users who signed up for the service before October 26, 2017 are impacted, according to a MyHeritage statement released on Monday regarding the incident.\u201cToday, June 4, 2018 at approximately 1 p.m. EST, MyHeritage\u2019s chief information security officer received a message from a security researcher that he had found a file named myheritage containing email addresses and hashed passwords, on a private server outside of MyHeritage,\u201d the statement reads.The company did not elaborate on the ownership or origin of the server. It did however confirm that the data originated from MyHeritage and included email addresses and hashed passwords of 92,283,889 users. No other data, such as user financial information, DNA and genealogy specifics, was found on the server hosting the data.\u201cWe have no reason to believe that any other MyHeritage systems were compromised\u2026 Other types of sensitive data such as family trees and DNA data are stored by MyHeritage on segregated systems, separate from those that store the email addresses, and they include added layers of security. We have no reason to believe those systems have been compromised,\u201d the firm said.The Israeli-based MyHeritage said the hash key differs for each customer password, suggesting they were salted and hashed, making it harder for cybercriminals to decode the 92 million individual coded passwords.The company noted it was complying with recently enacted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules form the European Union, given its multinational customer base. \u201cWe are taking steps to inform relevant authorities including as per GDPR,\u201d the company said. Under GDPR rules, passed May 25, companies with customers inside the EU have 72 hours to report a breach after becoming aware of the incident.The genealogy and DNA testing service company said it would be implementing two-factor authentication features for user accounts as well.DNA databases have come under closer scrutiny as more online companies commoditize the service, offering genetic sequencing at low prices and warehouse the data. Privacy activist warn while DNA databases can be a boon when it comes to tracking down and arresting people such as Joseph James DeAngelo, the alleged \u201cGolden State Killer,\u201d DNA samples can also be leaked and abused by criminals or by over-reaching law enforcement officials.Cloud SecurityHacksPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Software running Palo Alto Networks\u2019 firewalls is under attack, prompting U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue a warning to public and federal IT security teams to apply available fixes. Federal agencies urged to patch the bug by September 9.Earlier this month, Palo Alto Networks issued a fix for the high-severity bug (CVE-2022-0028) that it says adversaries attempted to exploit. The flaw could be used by remote hackers to carry out reflected and amplified denial-of-service (DoS) attacks without having to authenticate targeted systems.Palo Alto Networks maintains the flaw can only be exploited on a limited number of systems, under certain conditions and that the vulnerable systems are not part of a common firewall configuration. Any additional attacks exploiting the bug have either not occurred or been publicly reported.Affected Products and OS VersionsAffected products include those running the PAN-OS firewall software include PA-Series, VM-Series and CN-Series devices. PAN-OS versions vulnerable to attack, with patches available, include PAN-OS prior to 10.2.2-h2, PAN-OS prior to 10.1.6-h6, PAN-OS prior to 10.0.11-h1, PAN-OS prior to 9.1.14-h4, PAN-OS prior to 9.0.16-h3 and PAN-OS prior to 8.1.23-h1.According to Palo Alto Networks advisory; \u201cA PAN-OS URL filtering policy misconfiguration could allow a network-based attacker to conduct reflected and amplified TCP denial-of-service (RDoS) attacks. The DoS attack would appear to originate from a Palo Alto Networks PA-Series (hardware), VM-Series (virtual) and CN-Series (container) firewall against an attacker-specified target.\u201dThe advisory describes the non-standard configuration at risk as the \u201cfirewall configuration must have a URL filtering profile with one or more blocked categories assigned to a security rule with a source zone that has an external facing network interface.\u201dThe configuration is likely unintended by the network administrator, the advisory said.CISA Adds Bug to KEV CatalogOn Monday, CISA added the Palo Alto Networks bug to its list of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog is a curated list of flaws that have been exploited in the wild. It is also a list of KEVs that the agency \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d public and private organizations pay close attention to in order to \u201cprioritize remediation\u201d to \u201creduce the likelihood of compromise by known threat actors.\u201dReflective and Amplification DoS AttacksOne of the most notable evolutions in the DDoS landscape is the growth in the peak size of volumetric attacks. Attackers continue to use reflection/amplification techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in DNS, NTP, SSDP, CLDAP, Chargen and other protocols to maximize the scale of their attacks.Reflected and amplified denial-of-service attacks are not new and have steadily become more common over the years.Distributed denial of service attacks, bent on taking websites offline by overwhelming domains or specific application infrastructure with massive traffic flows, continue to pose a major challenge to businesses of all stripes. Being knocked offline impacts revenue, customer service and basic business functions \u2013 and worryingly, the bad actors behind these attacks are honing their approaches to become ever more successful over time.Unlike limited volume DDoS attacks, reflective and amplified DoS attacks can produce much higher volumes of disruptive traffic. This type of attack allows an adversary to magnify the amount of malicious traffic they generate while obscuring the sources of the attack traffic. An HTTP-based DDoS attack, for example, sends junk HTTP requests to a target\u2019s server tying up resources and locking out users from using a particular site or service.A TCP attack, believed used in the recent Palo Alto Networks attack, is when an attacker sends a spoofed SYN packet, with the original source IP replaced by the victim\u2019s IP address, to a range of random or pre-selected reflection IP addresses. The services at the reflection addresses reply with a SYN-ACK packet to the victim of the spoofed attack. If the victim does not respond, the reflection service will continue to retransmit the SYN-ACK packet, resulting in amplification. The amount of amplification depends on the number of SYN-ACK retransmits by the reflection service, which can be defined by the attacker.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "UPDATEAn unpatched OS command-injection security vulnerability has been disclosed in Fortinet\u2019s web application firewall (WAF) platform, known as FortiWeb. It could allow privilege escalation and full device takeover, researchers said.FortiWeb is a cybersecurity defense platform, aimed at protecting business-critical web applications from attacks that target known and unknown vulnerabilities. The firewall has been to keep up with the deployment of new or updated features, or the addition of new web APIs, according to Fortinet.The bug (CVE pending) exists in FortiWeb\u2019s management interface (version 6.3.11 and prior), and carries a CVSSv3 base score of 8.7 out of 10, making it high-severity. It can allow a remote, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, via the SAML server configuration page, according to Rapid7 researcher William Vu who discovered the bug.\u201cNote that while authentication is a prerequisite for this exploit, this vulnerability could be combined with another authentication-bypass issue, such as CVE-2020-29015,\u201d according to a Tuesday writeup on the issue.Once attackers are authenticated to the management interface of the FortiWeb device, they can smuggle commands using backticks in the \u201cName\u201d field of the SAML Server configuration page. These commands are then executed as the root user of the underlying operating system.\u201cAn attacker can leverage this vulnerability to take complete control of the affected device, with the highest possible privileges,\u201d according to the writeup. \u201cThey might install a persistent shell, crypto mining software, or other malicious software.\u201dThe damage could be worse if the management interface is exposed to the internet: Rapid7 noted that attackers could pivot to the wider network in that case. However, Rapid7 researchers identified less than three hundred appliances that appeared to be doing so.In the analysis, Vu provided a proof-of-concept exploit code, which uses an HTTP POST request and response.In light of the disclosure, Fortinet has sped up plans to release a fix for the problem with FortiWeb 6.4.1 \u2014 originally planned for the end of August, it will now be available by the end of the week.\u201cWe are working to deliver immediate notification of a workaround to customers and a patch released by the end of the week,\u201d it said in a statement provided to Threatpost.The firm also noted that Rapid7\u2019s disclosure was a bit of a surprise given vulnerability-disclosure norms in the industry.\u201cThe security of our customers is always our first priority. Fortinet\u00a0recognizes the important role of independent security researchers who work closely with vendors to protect the cybersecurity ecosystem in alignment with their responsible disclosure policies. In addition to directly communicating with researchers,\u00a0our disclosure policy is clearly outlined\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0Fortinet\u00a0PSIRT Policy page, which includes asking incident submitters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers. As such,\u00a0we had expected that Rapid7\u00a0hold\u00a0any findings prior to the end of\u00a0the our\u00a090-day Responsible disclosure window.\u00a0 We regret that in this instance, individual research was fully disclosed without adequate notification prior to the 90-day window.\u201dFor now, Rapid7 offered straightforward advice:\u201cIn the absence of a patch, users are advised to disable the FortiWeb device\u2019s management interface from untrusted networks, which would include the internet,\u201d according to Rapid7. \u201cGenerally speaking, management interfaces for devices like FortiWeb should not be exposed directly to the internet anyway \u2014 instead, they should be reachable only via trusted, internal networks, or over a secure VPN connection.\u201dThe Rapid7 researchers said that the vulnerability appears to be related to CVE-2021-22123, which was patched in June.Fortinet: Popular for ExploitThe vendor is no stranger to cybersecurity bugs in its platforms, and Fortinet\u2019s cybersecurity products are popular as exploitation avenues with cyberattackers, including nation-state actors. Users should prepare to patch quickly.In April, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that various advanced persistent threats (APTs) were actively exploiting three security vulnerabilities in the Fortinet SSL VPN for espionage. Exploits for CVE-2018-13379, CVE-2019-5591 and CVE-2020-12812 were being used for to gain a foothold within networks before moving laterally and carrying out recon, they warned.One of those bugs, a Fortinet vulnerability in FortiOS, was also seen being used to deliver a new ransomware strain, dubbed Cring, that is targeting industrial enterprises across Europe.This post was updated August 18 at 1:30 p.m. ET with a statement from Fortinet.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Germany-based cybersecurity company Genua has fast-tracked a fix for a critical flaw in one of its firewall products. If exploited, the vulnerability could allow local attackers to bypass authentication measures and log in to internal company networks with the highest level of privileges.Genua says it offers more than 20 security solutions for encrypting data communication via the internet, remotely maintaining systems, securely accessing remote data and more \u2013 used by anything from critical infrastructure companies to German federal agencies. Affected by the critical flaws is the GenuGate High Resistance Firewall, which Genua touts as a two-tier firewall that includes an application-level gateway and a packet filter for blocking malicious data.\u201cAn unauthenticated attacker is able to successfully login as arbitrary user in the admin web interface, the side channel interface and user web interface, even as root with highest privileges, by manipulating certain HTTP POST parameters during login,\u201d according to security and application consultation company SEC Consult on Monday.Genua GenuGate High Resistance FirewallGenua says that the GenuGate High Resistance Firewall blocks internal networks against unauthorized access, and structures an intranet to establish various domains with different protection measures.According to Genua, GenuGate is classified as \u201cNATO Restricted.\u201d NATO is a security classification for restricted information\u00a0from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It requires that certain products contain safeguards and protection from public release and disclosure. According to Genua:\u201cThe High Resistance Firewall genugate satisfies the highest requirements: two different firewall systems \u2013 an application level gateway and\u00a0 a packet filter, each on separate hardware \u2013 are combined to form a compact solution. genugate is approved for classification levels German and NATO RESTRICTED and RESTREINT UE/EU RESTRICTED. genugate is certified according to CC EAL 4+\u201dThe vulnerable versions of the firewall include GenuGate versions below 10.1 p4; below 9.6 p7 and versions 9.0 and below Z p19.\u00a0The flaw has been fixed in GenuGate versions 10.1 p4 (G1010_004); 9.6 p7 (G960_007); 9.0 and 9.0 Z p19 (G900_019).\u201cThe vendor provides a patched version for the affected products which should be installed immediately,\u201d according to SEC Consult. \u201cCustomers should also adhere to security best practices such as network segmentation and limiting access to the admin panel. This is also a requirement for certified and approved environments.\u201dCritical GenuGate Firewall Cybersecurity FlawThe critical authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-27215) stems from the GenuGate\u2019s various admin authentication methods. The admin web interface, sidechannel web and userweb interface, use different methods to authenticate users.But during the login process, certain HTTP POST parameters are passed to the server, which does not check the provided data, and allows for any authentication request.By manipulating a specific parameter method, an attacker is able would be able bypass the authentication easily and login as arbitrary user. That could include logging in as a root user with the highest privileges (or even a non-existing user), said SEC Consult researchers.Researchers with SEC Consult published a high-level proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, including a video (see below). However, researchers abstained from publishing specific PoC details due to the critical nature of the bug.There is one caveat. In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to have network access to the admin interface.\u201cCertified and approved environments mandate that the admin interface is only reachable through a strictly separated network,\u201d according to SEC Consult. \u201cNevertheless, it is a highly critical security vulnerability and must be patched immediately.\u201dCybersecurity Firewall Vulnerabilities and RemediationResearchers contacted Genua on Jan. 29 regarding the vulnerability. That same day, Genua confirmed the issue and began working on a patch \u2013 and released a patch for the affected product on Feb. 2. The public disclosure of the vulnerability (in coordination with CERT-Bund and CERT) was published, Monday.\u00a0SEC Consult said, the patch can be downloaded in GenuGate GUI or by calling \u201cgetpatches\u201d on the command line interface.Firewall vulnerabilities provide a dangerous route for attackers to infiltrate sensitive company networks.In January, security experts warned hackers are ramping up attempts to exploit a high-severity vulnerability that may still reside in over 100,000 Zyxel Communications products, which are generally utilized by small businesses as firewalls and VPN gateways.\u00a0In April, attackers started targeting the Sophos XG Firewall (both physical and virtual versions) using a zero-day exploit, with the ultimate goal of dropping the Asnarok malware on vulnerable appliances.Genua has not responded to a request for comment.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Most industrial sites deploy firewalls as the first line of defense for their Operations Technology (OT) / industrial networks. However, configuring and managing these firewalls is a complex undertaking. Configuration and other mistakes are easy to make.This article explores eight common mistakes that firewall administrators make and describes how these mistakes can compromise firewall functionality and network security. The lesson here though is not \u201cstop making mistakes.\u201d This article also explores unidirectional gateway technology as an alternative to our most important OT firewalls. Unidirectional gateways provide physical protection for industrial operations, rather than merely software protection. This means that with a unidirectional gateway, no mistake in configuration can impair the protection that the gateway provides to the industrial network.Everyone makes mistakes. The secret to secure operations is not to magically avoid all mistakes, but to design our industrial networks so that even when we make mistakes configuring our defenses, there is still no threat to correct and continuous industrial operations.#1 \u2013 Leaving the IP \u201cany to any\u201d access rule in placeFirewalls are inconsistent and confusing. Most consumer firewalls deny all connections inbound to the home network by default but permit all outgoing connections with an \u201callow any to any\u201d rule. Commercial and industrial grade firewalls are inconsistent \u2013 some have a \u201cdeny all\u201d default policy for all directions of traffic. Some have a default \u201callow all to any\u201d. Some have a default \u201callow any to any\u201d until the first non-default rule is configured, and the default then switches to \u201cdeny all.\u201d Some show their default rules in their configuration user interfaces, and others do not.This makes it very easy, for some models of firewalls, to mistakenly leave an \u201callow any to any\u201d rule in place.\u00a0 The consequences of mistakenly leaving a visible default or invisible implied \u201callow any to any\u201d rule in place is, of course, that very many kinds of connections into our industrial networks are left enabled \u2013 the rule permits all connections/attacks into our networks that are not explicitly forbidden by some other rule we have configured.#2 Using the wrong order of rulesOnce we have identified all the rules that need to be set up for a firewall, we must pay careful attention to the order of the rules in the rule set. Firewall rules are processed in order. Rules entered or configured in the wrong order will yield unexpected and undesirable firewall behaviors.For example, imagine we have two rules, one saying \u201caccept all connections from IP addresses 1-64 in a subnet\u201d and a second one saying \u201cdeny connections from IP address 23\u201d in that same subnet. If the accept rule is first in the ruleset, and the firewall receives a connection request from address 23, then the \u201caccept 1-64\u201d rule causes the connection to be allowed. The \u201cdeny\u201d rule is never evaluated.#3 Failing to disable unused administrative interfacesSince firewall manufacturers want to ensure easy configuration, they enable many types of administrative interfaces by default, often including SSH, Telnet, and serial interfaces, as well as encrypted and unencrypted web interfaces. Leaving un-encrypted interfaces enabled means attackers may be able to see passwords on the network when those interfaces are used. In addition, leaving any un-necessary interfaces enabled increases the attack surface and exposure. It also enables attackers to use phishing attacks or other attacks to steal passwords for these interfaces and simply log in to reconfigure the firewall.#4 Leaving the firewall default password unchangedMost firewalls ship with a default administrative user name and password. These passwords are documented in the device\u2019s user manual and so are well-known to attackers and to anyone else who searches for the information. Failing to change the default password means that any attacker who can connect to one of the administrative interfaces that we have left enabled can log into the firewall and reconfigure it.Failing to change the default password is an especially common error when the firewall is connected to external authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) service such as a RADIUS server, Active Directory server, IAM infrastructure, or other password management server. Password management services generally have no control over the built-in administrator account and password. In fact, best practice holds that at least one administrator account should be beyond the reach of the identity management system, to serve as a backup in case we lose contact with the AAA system for any reason.#5 Failing to patch the firewallEngineers and administrators may have extensive and costly testing and software update programs to keep their industrial control systems patched. These programs often focus on difficult-to-patch operations equipment to the exclusion of network infrastructure components such as firewalls and managed switches. Failing to patch a firewall means that attackers can use well-known and widely-available exploits for old and well-known firewall vulnerabilities to compromise our firewalls.#6 Failing to plan for additional infrastructure costsDeploying a firewall can incur significant and unexpected costs because firewall deployments often demand significant changes to other infrastructures. These changes and costs may include:Renumbering IP addresses on OT and/or enterprise networks when a new firewall is used to segment what was previously a \u201cflat\u201d network,Additional network infrastructure, such as switches, routers, and authentication systems, andPeople and/or systems to gather, correlate, and analyze firewall logs, to try to detect when an attacker is guessing passwords or otherwise trying to gain access to our networks.Even greater than these costs, there may be downtime costs for physical/industrial operations if any of the above changes require a restart of the entire control system, and such restarts are often necessary.#7 Mismanaging rule sets over timeFirewall rules must be updated and reviewed regularly. \u201cTemporary\u201d rules that are introduced for short-term testing, emergency repairs, and other needs, must not be allowed to persist. Rules for obsolete equipment and software systems must be removed. Rules must be removed that provide OT access for IP addresses used by employees who have left the organization or who have changed responsibilities. All of these and many other changes must be documented, so that future reviewers know who to contact to determine whether configured rules are still necessary.In short, if we permit un-necessary rules to accumulate, then over time the firewall looks more and more like a router \u2013 permitting far too many kinds of connections into the very networks the device was nominally deployed to protect.#8 Believing a firewall is \u201coutbound only\u201dIn process control system networks, there is often a belief that we are protected because the firewall has been configured to permit only outbound connections, from the industrial network to an external network. This is a serious mistake. To quote Ed Skoudis, a respected SANS instructor, \u201coutbound access equals inbound command and control.\u201d All TCP connections, even those through a firewall, are two-way connections. Connections to email servers and web servers pull attacks through \u201coutbound only\u201d firewalls all the time. Malware connecting to command and control servers does the same. More generally, industrial clients connecting to compromised enterprise services risk propagating compromise into control systems and putting industrial operations in peril.The unidirectional alternativeThoroughly secured industrial networks increasingly deploy unidirectional gateway technology at IT/OT interfaces, instead of firewalls. One important advantage for unidirectional technology is that even when accidentally misconfigured, no misconfiguration can impair the protection that the gateways provide to OT networks. Unidirectional gateway hardware is physically able to send information in only one direction \u2013 from the OT network out to the enterprise. No cyber attack, however sophisticated, can change the behavior of the hardware, nor can any cyber attack information reach through the hardware to impair the protected OT network in any way.To simplify safe IT/OT integration, unidirectional gateway software replicates servers from industrial to enterprise networks. For example, let\u2019s say enterprise users and applications acquire their OT data from a SQL-based historian database. In this case, the unidirectional gateways query the database on the OT side, convert the received data into unidirectional formats, send the data to the enterprise side, and there insert the data into an identical SQL/historian database. Enterprise users and applications then have access to their data normally and bi-directionally from the enterprise replica database. If needed, the replica database server can have exactly the same IP address as the industrial historian database has \u2013 this because the unidirectional gateway is not a firewall or a router, and so cannot be confused by the same IP addresses in use on both sides of the device.With unidirectional gateway hardware protecting an industrial network, no software attack from an enterprise network, or from the Internet beyond the network, can reach the protected OT network, no matter how many passwords are stolen or systems we might not be able to patch.SummaryFirewalls are easy to misconfigure. While the security consequences of such errors may be acceptable for some firewalls, the accumulated risks of misconfigured firewalls in a defense-in-depth OT network architecture are generally unacceptable. The solution is only partly to \u201cbe more diligent\u201d about managing our firewalls. No human process is perfect. In addition, many industrial and critical infrastructure sites replace at least one layer of firewalls in their defense-in-depth architecture with unidirectional gateways. The most common such deployment is to replace the IT/OT interface firewall with a gateway.With at least one layer of unidirectional gateway in place, the attack path leading from the Internet into our OT networks is broken. Unidirectional gateway hardware prevents any online cyber attack, no matter how sophisticated, from reaching our vulnerable production networks. The hardware saves the OT network from interference, even if we have accidentally misconfigured the gateway software.Free book: Unidirectional gateway technology is often misunderstood.

        "raw text": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been uncovered in the CUJO Smart Firewall, which is a security hardware device aimed at protecting home networks against malware, phishing websites and hacking attempts.CUJO is widely available, including on Amazon where it has racked up 1,000+ customer reviews. The firewall reportedly contains vulnerabilities that researchers at Cisco Talos said could allow attackers to potentially take complete control of the device, opening the door to monitoring home network traffic and stealing sensitive information.Two types of exploits are possible, the researchers said. One is executing arbitrary code in the context of the root account. And the second is uploading and executing unsigned kernels on affected systems.CUJO AI said that it has started the process to automatically update the devices with firmware.Exploitation\u201cWe identified two chains that could be used to execute code remotely without authentication,\u201d the researchers said in a Tuesday posting.In one, a vulnerability in the Webroot BrightCloud SDK (CVE-2018-4012), which CUJO uses as part of its safe browsing protection, would allow an unauthenticated attacker to impersonate BrightCloud\u2019s services and execute code on the device as the root user.\u201cThe BrightCloud SDK defaults to using HTTP connections to communicate with the remote BrightCloud services, making the exploitation of [the bug] trivial if an attacker is able to intercept traffic between CUJO and BrightCloud,\u201d according to the advisory.In the second, a script-injection vulnerability (CVE-2018-4031) in the Lunatik Lua engine, which CUJO uses to analyze network traffic as part of its safe-browsing protection, allows any unauthenticated user in the local network to execute Lua scripts in the kernel by specifying an arbitrary \u201cHost\u201d header in HTTP requests.\u201cSince Lunatik permits the use of the unsafe `load()` Lua function, this allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the kernel,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cAdditionally, [another vulnerability] describes an issue that can be used to trick CUJO into extracting and analyzing any arbitrary hostname.\u201dAs a result, a \u201cmalicious website could chain both vulnerabilities together in order to force any client machine in CUJO\u2019s network to perform a POST request via JavaScript, triggering the Lua injection and effectively executing code in the kernel.\u201dThese can also be further chained together with a verified boot bypass flaw in the Das U-Boot software that CUJO uses in order to permanently compromise the device \u2013 this is somewhat mitigated however by the fact that the attacker would need to be local.Here, a flaw in the Das U-Boot (CVE-2018-3968) allows an attacker with local or physical access to execute an unsigned kernel embedded in a legacy image format if they are able to supply a boot image to the device.\u201cThis vulnerability exists due to the fact that the version of Das U-Boot used by the devices lacks proper FIT signature enforcement during the boot process,\u201d said researchers.The version used by the CUJO Smart Firewall is vulnerable to this bypass (CVE-2018-3969); successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands during the system boot process. By embedding system commands into the `/config/dhcpd.conf` file, an attacker can force those commands to be executed each time the system is rebooted.In all, Cisco Talos researchers said they found 11 flaws in the device.Don\u2019t miss our free live Threatpost webinar, \u201cExploring the Top 15 Most Common Vulnerabilities with HackerOne and GitHub,\u201d on Wed., Mar 20, at 2:00 p.m. ET.Vulnerability experts Michiel Prins, co-founder of webinar sponsor HackerOne, and Greg Ose, GitHub\u2019s application security engineering manager, will join Threatpost editor Tom Spring to discuss what vulnerability types are most common in today\u2019s software, and what kind of impact they would have on organizations if exploited.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Cisco is urging customers to update their wireless VPN and firewall routers, after patching a critical vulnerability that could allow unauthenticated, remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.The vulnerability, CVE-2019-1663, has a CVSS score of 9.8 and impacts the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router. These small business routers are used for wireless connectivity in small offices and home offices.\u201cA successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of the affected device as a high-privilege user,\u201d said Cisco is its Wednesday advisory.Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the web-based management interface for the three router models. The management interface for these devices is available through a local LAN connection or the remote management feature.The glitch stems from the interface, which does not properly double check the user-supplied data sent to it. So an attacker could send malicious HTTP requests to the impacted targeted devices, and ultimately execute code on them. Making matters worse, the attacker could be unauthenticated and remote.\u201cThe vulnerability is reportedly due to improperly validated user input fields through the HTTP/HTTPS user management interface, said Ryan Seguin, engineer with Tenable, in a Wednesday\u00a0analysis of the flaw. \u201cCisco has tagged this vulnerability with CWE-119, the designation for a buffer overflow. This means that a pre-authentication user input field on these devices can be manipulated into dropping code into the device\u2019s memory, which it then executes at the system level.\u201dRouters with the remote-management feature enabled are exposed to a remote attack, Cisco said. The feature is disabled by default, but administrators can check if remote management is enabled by selecting Basic Settings>Remote Management in their router\u2019s web interface.While Cisco did not detail whether the vulnerability was being exploited in the wild, the tech giant released firmware updates for the affected devices that address it.The patched software versions are: RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall version 1.2.2.1, RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router version 1.0.3.45, and RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router version 1.3.1.1.The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers Yu Zhang and Haoliang Lu, and T. Shiomitsu of Pen Test Partners.Cisco routers with vulnerabilities \u2013 even those with patches issued for them \u2013 are frequently targeted by attackers. In January, malicious scanning activity targeting Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN routers with just-patched vulnerabilities was discovered. And in November, attackers actively exploited a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2018-15454) in certain Cisco security products, to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.IoTVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Siemens AG on Tuesday issued a slew of fixes addressing eight vulnerabilities spanning its industrial product lines. The most serious of the patched flaws include a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Siemens\u2019 SCALANCE firewall product. The flaw could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to industrial networks and ultimately put operations and production at risk.The SCALANCE S firewall is used to protect secure industrial networks from untrusted network traffic, and allows filtering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways.\u00a0Siemens S602, S612, S623, S627-2M SCALANCE devices with software versions prior to V4.0.1.1 are impacted.Researchers with Applied Risk, who discovered the flaw, said that vulnerability exists in the web server of the firewall software. An attacker can carry out the attack by crafting a malicious link and tricking an administrator \u2013 who is logged into the web server \u2013 to click that link. Once an admin does so, the attacker can execute commands on the web server, on the administrator\u2019s behalf.\u201cThe integrated web server allows a cross-site scripting attack if an administrator is misled into accessing a malicious link,\u201d Applied Risk researcher Nelson Berg said in an analysis of the flaw. \u201cSuccessful exploitation may lead to the ability to bypass critical security measures provided by the firewall.\u201dExploitation of this vulnerability could ultimately enable threat actors to bypass critical security functions provided by the firewall, potentially providing access to industrial networks and putting operations and production at risk.The vulnerability, CVE-2018-16555, has a CVSS score which Applied Risk researcher calculates to be 8.2 (or high severity).That said, researchers said a successful exploit is not completely seamless and takes some time and effort to carry out \u2013 for an attacker to exploit the flaw, user interaction is required and the administrator must be logged into the web interface.Researchers said that no exploit of the vulnerability has been discovered thus far.Siemens addressed the reported vulnerability by releasing a software update (V4.0.1.1) and also advised customers to \u201conly access links from trusted sources in the browser you use to access the SCALANCE S administration website.\u201dThe industrial company also released an array of fixes for other vulnerabilities on Tuesday. Overall, eight advisories were released by the US CERT.Another serious vulnerability (CVE-2018-16556) addressed was an improper input validation flaw in certain Siemens S7-400 CPUs. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed which may require a manual reboot or firmware re-image to bring the system back to normal operation, according to the advisory.\u201cSpecially crafted packets sent to Port 102/TCP via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS, or via multi-point interfaces (MPI) could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to resume normal operation,\u201d according to US Cert.An improper access control vulnerability that is exploitable remotely in Siemens IEC 61850 system configurator, DIGSI 5, DIGSI 4, SICAM PAS/PQS, SICAM PQ Analyzer, and SICAM SCC, was also mitigated.The vulnerability, CVE-2018-4858, has a CVSS of 4.2 and exists in a service of the affected products listening on all of the host\u2019s network interfaces on either Port 4884/TCP, Port 5885/TCP, or Port 5886/TCP. The service could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions.\u201cSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to exfiltrate limited data from the system or execute code with operating system user permissions,\u201d according to the ICS US Cert advisory.Also mitigated were an improper authentication vulnerability (CVE-2018-13804) in SIMATIC IT Production Suite and a code injection vulnerability(CVE-2018-13814) in SIMATIC Panels and SIMATIC WinCC\u00a0that \u00a0could allow an attacker with network access to the web server to perform a HTTP header injection attack.Critical InfrastructureVulnerabilities",

It was first discovered by Cedric Halbronn, a researcher with NCC Group.A successful attacker would be able to view all data moving through the system, along with giving them admin privileges and remote access to the network, according to NCC. Meanwhile, \u201ctargeting the vulnerability without a specially-crafted exploit would cause the firewall to crash and would potentially disrupt the connectivity to the network,\u201d the company said.The vulnerability could be up to seven years old, according to a detailed presentation [PDF] Halbronn gave this week at the REcon conference in Brussels.Users posted proof-of-concept code to Pastebin, with the title \u201cCisco ASA CVE-2018-0101 Crash PoC.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether the attacks referenced by Cisco employed the code.Cisco issued a patch for the vulnerability, but days later updated it after finding additional attack vectors and features that are impacted by it.The vulnerability is associated with ASA\u2019s XML parser. Attackers can exploit it by pushing a malicious XML file through, allowing them to \u201cexecute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests,\u201d according to Cisco\u2019s security advisory.Affected products include the 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliance, ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls, Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance, a range of Firepower Security appliances and Firepower Threat Defense Software.HacksVulnerabilities",

It received a Common Vulnerability Scoring System base score of 10.0, the highest possible, and was initially discovered by Cedric Halbronn from NCC Group.\u201cAfter broadening the investigation, Cisco engineers found other attack vectors and features that are affected by this vulnerability that were not originally identified by the NCC Group and subsequently updated the security advisory,\u201d said Omar Santos, principal engineer with Cisco\u2019s product security incident response team, in a blog post. Cisco also found additional denial of service conditions. A \u201cnew comprehensive fix\u201d is now available, Santos said.The vulnerability is linked to ASA\u2019s XML parser. An attacker could exploit it by crafting a malicious XML file and sending it through a vulnerable interface, whereupon they could \u201cexecute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system, cause a reload of the affected device or stop processing of incoming VPN authentication requests,\u201d Cisco said in its security advisory. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) services or IKEv2 Remote Access VPN services must be enabled on an interface for the vulnerability to be exploited.There are no known incidents of the vulnerability being exploited, but Cisco is urging customers to apply the updated patches.

        "raw text": "Zeppelin ransomware is back and employing new compromise and encryption tactics in its recent campaigns against various vertical industries\u2014particularly healthcare\u2014as well as critical infrastructure organizations, the feds are warning.Threat actors deploying the ransomware as a service (RaaS) are tapping remote desktop protocol (RDD) exploitation and SonicWall firewall vulnerabilities\u2013alongside previously used phishing campaigns\u2013to breach target networks, according to an advisory from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released Thursday.Zeppelin also appears to have a new multi-encryption tactics, executing the malware more than once within a victim\u2019s network and creating different IDs and file extensions for multiple instances attack, according to the CISA.\u201cThis results in the victim needing several unique decryption keys,\u201d according to the advisory.The CISA has identified multiple variants of Zeppelin through various FBI investigations, with attacks occurring as recently as June 21, the agency said.Targets and TacticsZeppelin is a variant of the Delphi-based ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) family initially known as Vega or VegaLocker, which emerged at the beginning of 2019 in advertisements on the Russia-based Yandex.Direct, according to BlackBerry Cylance.Unlike its predecessor, Zeppelin\u2019s campaigns have been much more targeted, with threat actors first taking aim at tech and healthcare companies in Europe and the United States.The latest campaigns continue to target healthcare and medical organizations most often, according to the CISA. Tech companies also remain in the crosshairs of Zeppelin, with threat actors also using the RaaS in attacks against defense contractors, educational institutions and manufacturers, the agency said.Once they successfully infiltrate a network, threat actors spend one to two weeks mapping or enumerating it to identify data enclaves, including cloud storage and network backup, according to the agency. They then deploy Zeppelin ransomware as a .dll or .exe file or contained within a PowerShell loader.Zeppelin also appears to be using the common ransomware tactic of double extortion in its latest campaigns, exfiltrating sensitive data files from a target prior to encryption for potential publication online later if the victim refuses to pay, according to the CISA.Multiple EncryptionOnce Zeppelin ransomware is executed on a network, each encrypted file is appended with a randomized nine-digit hexadecimal number as a file extension, e.g., file.txt.txt.C59-E0C-929, according to the CISA.Threat actors also leave a note file that includes a ransom note on compromised systems, typically on a user desktop system, the agency said. Zeppelin actors typically request payments in Bitcoin in the range of several thousand dollars to more than $1 million.The latest campaigns also show threat actors using a new tactic associated with Zeppelin to execute the malware multiple times within a victim\u2019s network, which means a victim would need not one but multiple decryption keys to unlock files, according to the CISA.However, this may or may not be a unique aspect of a ransomware attack, noted one security professional. Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist for security firm KnowBe4, said it\u2019s not uncommon for threat actors to encrypt different files separately but use one master key to unlock systems.\u201cMost ransomware programs today have an overall master key which encrypts a bunch of other\u00a0keys which really do the encryption,\u201d he told Threatpost in an email.When the victim asks for proof that the ransomware attacker has decryption keys that can successfully unlock files if a ransom is paid, the ransomware group then uses a single key to unlock a single set of files to prove its worth, Grimes said.MalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "An SQL-injection vulnerability discovered in a WordPress plugin called \u201cSpam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk\u201d could expose user emails, passwords, credit-card data and other sensitive information to an unauthenticated attacker.Spam protection, AntiSpam, FireWall by CleanTalk is installed on more than 100,000 sites, and is mainly used to weed out spam and trash comments on website discussion boards.Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.According to Wordfence, the issue (CVE-2021-24295, which carries a high-severity CVSS vulnerability rating of 7.5 out of 10) arises thanks to how it performs that filtering. It maintains a blocklist and tracks the behavior of different IP addresses, including the user-agent string that browsers send to identify themselves.\u201cUnfortunately, the update_log function in lib/Cleantalk/ApbctWP/Firewall/SFW.php, which was used to insert records of these requests into the database, failed to use a prepared SQL statement,\u201d according to the firm, which released an analysis on Tuesday.SQL injection is a web-security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database, so that they intercept or infer the responses that databases return when queried. Prepared statements are one of the ways to prevent this; they isolate each query parameter so that an adversary would not be able to see the entire scope of the data that\u2019s returned.Researchers were able to successfully exploit the vulnerability in CleanTalk via the time-based blind SQL-injection technique, they said. This is an approach that involves sending requests to the database that \u201cguess\u201d at the content of a database table and instruct the database to delay the response or \u201csleep\u201d if the guess is correct.\u201cFor example, a request might ask the database if the first letter of the admin user\u2019s email address starts with the letter \u2018c,\u2019 and instruct it to delay the response by five seconds if this is true, and then try guessing the next letters in sequence,\u201d according to Wordfence. \u201cThere are a number of other SQL-injection techniques that can work around many forms of traditional input sanitization depending on the exact construction of the vulnerable query.\u201dWordfence did outline several features in the plugin code that make the issue more difficult to exploit. For instance, the vulnerable SQL query is an \u201cinsert\u201d query.\u201cSince data was not being inserted into a sensitive table, the insert query could not be used by an attacker to exploit the site by changing values in the database, and this also made it difficult to retrieve any sensitive data from the database,\u201d according to Wordfence.Also, the SQL statement used the \u201csanitize_text_field\u201d function in an attempt to prevent SQL injection, and the user-agent was included in the query within single quotes.\u201cDespite these obstacles, we were able to craft a proof-of-concept capable of extracting data from anywhere in the database by sending requests containing SQL commands in the user-agent request header,\u201d researchers said.To be protected, web admins should update the patched version of the plugin, 5.153.4.Join Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d \u2013 a LIVE roundtable event on\u00a0Wed, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Taking aim at the status-quo of macOS firewalls, researcher Patrick Wardle has made his case for Apple and third-party security firms to beef up their protections.At a session here at Black Hat 2018, Wardle, chief research officer at Digita Security and founder of Mac security company Objective-See, showed how easy it is to break, bypass and dismantle macOS firewall products.For starters, Wardle pointed out that while macOS does have a built-in application firewall, its effectiveness is limited because it only blocks and monitors incoming connections; there\u2019s no processing of outgoing connections, he points out.\u201cThat means if a piece of malware does get on your system in some way, even if your Mac firewall is on, it\u2019s not going to filter or block that (outbound) connection,\u201d Wardle said.Those shortcomings put the spotlight on third-party macOS firewall solutions. But, even with those, Wardle uncovered problems. During his talk, Wardle showed that it\u2019s fairly trivial to bypass these firewall products.In a test of top third-party macOS firewall products, he found that some simply \u201clook for\u201d the name of the whitelisted process. And if the process is recognized (and appears legitimate) the firewall lets the connection through.\u201cBasically, you could just name your malware the same name of the process,\u201d he said. \u201cThe firewall isn\u2019t even looking at the path, just the name.\u201dIn more worrisome findings, other firewalls simply check what domains a process is reaching out to. He points out that an attacker could easily host malicious software or plant a C2 hub on an iCloud domain in order to trick the firewall.\u201cAn attacker could easily exfiltrate data to an iDrive account,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cA firewall would see this traffic and allow it because they fully trust that domain.\u201dOther bypass techniques for adversaries (when they already have a foothold on a system) include piggybacking on trusted application traffic.\u201cToday our computers are so connected, that invariably there\u2019s going to be some traffic that\u2019s basically going to be allowed out \u2013 even if the firewall is set to be very restrictive,\u201d he said.That creates an opportunity for an attacker to passively monitor what traffic is allowed by the firewall. \u201cFrom that it can intelligently choose a variety of ways to surreptitiously utilize either those same trusted protocols for the same trusted processes to piggyback off them,\u201d he said.Examples include using the trusted DNS protocol in DNS tunneling attacks. On the macOS the DNS requests are handled by a core Apple trusted system daemon. So if malware (or a third-party application) tries to resolve a DNS name, that\u2019s going to be routed through the core Apple daemon on the applications behalf, he said.\u201cSo if there\u2019s a firewall sitting there, it\u2019s going to see that request going through and say, \u2018Hey, this is a DNS requests from the daemon, I have to let it go though,'\u201d he explained. \u201cSuch bypasses could be easily added to existing macOS malware to allow [attackers] to perform undetected bi-directional network communications \u2013 even on systems protected by firewall products.\u201dWardle said he\u2019s not trying to pick on firewall-makers, but rather, he\u2019s pointing out their limitations and breaking any preconceived notion that they\u2019re a panacea when it comes to fighting off malware. \u201cYou need to know your limitations with any product. You\u2019re are not going to buy a car and expect it to fly,\u201d he said.he also pointed out that macOS firewalls are several paces behind their Windows counterparts. Windows firewalls are more mature mainly because they have been a bigger target for attackers for so long, he said.Wardle said he wasn\u2019t aware of any publicly available Mac malware that has any firewall bypasses in them; however,\u00a0\u201cI would confidently say that advanced adversaries that are developing persistent Mac implants know they are going to have no problem passing these products,\u201d he said.In an effort to encourage development of better host-based macOS firewall products, Wardle released the open-source LuLu firewall earlier this year. The code is hosted on GitHub and he hopes it will be serve as a starting point for more robust macOS firewalls in the future.Black HatHacksPrivacyVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "A critical security bug in Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Cortex XSOAR could allow remote attackers to run commands and automations in the Cortex XSOAR War Room and to take other actions on the platform, without having to log in.Found internally by Palo Alto, the bug (CVE-2021-3044) is an improper-authorization vulnerability that \u201cenables a remote unauthenticated attacker with network access to the Cortex XSOAR server to perform unauthorized actions through the REST API,\u201d according to the security vendor\u2019s Tuesday advisory. It rates 9.8 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale.Cortex XSOAR Bug: Security ImpactCortex XSOAR is a cybersecurity defense platform used in a variety of use cases, including security operations automation, threat-intelligence management, automated ransomware remediation and cloud-security orchestration, according to Palo Alto\u2019s website. SOAR stands for \u201csecurity orchestration, automation and response,\u201d and in Palo Alto\u2019s case the term is used to mean taking a unified approach to centralizing threat intelligence and security alerts across sources. The Cortex platform also implements automated workflows and response playbooks, and allows real-time collaboration between teams.As such, it\u2019s the nexus of a company\u2019s security response.If remote attackers can run commands and automations in the War Room, they can potentially subvert ongoing security investigations, steal information about a victim\u2019s cyber-defense action plans and more.\u00a0According to Palo Alto\u2019s online documentation, real-time investigations are facilitated through the War Room, which allows analysts (and on vulnerable systems, remote attackers) to do the following:Run real-time security actions through the command-line interface, without switching consoles.Run security playbooks, scripts and commands.Collaborate and execute remote actions across integrated products.Capture incident context from different sources.Document all actions in one source.Converse with others for joint investigations.\u201cWhen you open the War Room, you can see a number of entries such as commands, notes, evidence, tasks, etc.,\u201d the documentation reads.A mitigating factor however is the fact that an adversary, as mentioned, would need to have access to the same network that the Cortex XSOAR is attached to, requiring an earlier compromise or exploit.Affected Versions and PatchesThe issue impacts only Cortex XSOAR configurations with active API key integrations, and specifically the following versions: Cortex XSOAR 6.1.0 builds later than 1016923 and earlier than 1271064; and Cortex XSOAR 6.2.0 builds earlier than 1271065.To protect themselves, users should update to the latest version.Palo Alto said that it\u2019s not aware of any exploitation of the bug in the wild.Join Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET\u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "The cybersecurity good news and bad news about phishing attacks is employees can be an enterprise\u2019s weakest link or strongest first line of defense. Yes, we are talking about inboxes, human nature and the increasingly sophisticated number of phishing attacks.The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported phishing attacks linked to a majority of U.S.-based cybercrimes in 2020 \u2013 responsible for 241,342 complaints and tied to $54 million in losses. Over 90 percent of malware slips past poorly protected corporate firewalls via email and nearly 30 percent of security breaches are linked to an evolving variety of complex phishing attacks ranging from spear-, HTTPS-, angler-, pharm- and clone-phishing.Thwart Phishing with Employee Awareness and TrainingEmployee awareness of phishing attack trends is vital to protect a company\u2019s digital crown jewels. Recent stats on \u201cthink before you click\u201d educational campaigns show cyber readiness pays off for companies. Verizon\u2019s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report confirmed anti-phishing training is effective and reduced, by double-digit percentage points, the number of times employees click on malicious inbox messages.Corporate anti-phishing awareness can include training sessions and how-to-spot exercises. However, those only begin to help IT security teams identify risk and determine training effectiveness. That has pushed companies such as Trend Micro to deliver more complete anti-phishing efforts, which include simulated phishing attacks and ways to measure and reinforce employee awareness.Real-Life Training with an Effective Phishing Attack SimulationTrend Micro\u2019s Cyber Security Awareness platform, called Phish Insight, is based on four pillars:Simulating phishing attacksIdentifying employee riskTraining employeesMonitoring results and reinforcing trainingWhat Gives Trend Micro\u2019s Phish Insight an Edge? \u00a0Leveraging over 30 years of Trend Micro\u2019s expertise in cybersecurity and having a daily awareness of real-world threats gives Phish Insight an edge. The simulated attacks mirror the tricks used by today\u2019s top threat actors. And with over 200 simulated phish templates (and new ones added monthly) security teams can a\u2019 la carte pick attack types ranging from software updates, failed logons and email messages linking to spoofed landing pages. The multitude of options are designed to help expose risk at all staffing and department levels within a company.Security auditors can also manipulate when simulated phish messages hit inboxes, just like criminals. Campaigns are customizable and can be sprung on staff at times most opportune to employees letting down their guard, such as during a mid-afternoon slump.From Email Oblivious into Inbox Watchdogs\u00a0 Phish Insight\u2019s Software-as-a-Service platform is turnkey, allowing a single dashboard for launching campaigns, monitoring and understanding employee security soft spots. For example, once users are identified as \u201cat risk\u201d, the platform allows for immediate intervention via \u00a0educational landing pages or one of over 100 training modules.Training content is sourced from market leading cyber-training vendors and the \u00a0sessions are always fresh, with content designed to match different teams, departments, roles and employee seniority. Once employees are engaged in training sessions, facilitators can track attendance and monitor training effectiveness, as measured against ongoing simulated phishing attacks.The Phish Insight dashboard keeps score on what exactly was clicked on, what operating system and browser version was used. The platform can also detect if any sensitive data was shared. Data can be visualized online or downloaded as a spreadsheet-friendly .CSV file.Free-to-Try Trend Micro Phish InsightPhish Insight is a SaaS service aimed at enterprise admin and corporate email recipients. Its purpose is to raise an employee\u2019s security awareness so they can protect themselves and their company from internet fraud, phishing and other cyber security threats.The platform is capable of synchronizing with a company\u2019s Active Directory, allowing for easy deployment and management.You can get started with Trend Micro\u2019s Phish Insight for free.

        "raw text": "A new threat actor, dubbed DEV-0343, has been spotted attacking U.S. and Israeli defense technology companies, Persian Gulf ports of entry and global maritime transportation companies with ties to the Middle East. The threat actor\u2019s goal is Microsoft Office 365 account takeovers.Microsoft, which began tracking the activity in late July 2021, detailed the attacks in an alert released Monday, adding that the culprits appear to be bent on espionage and have ties to Iran. It stated cyberattackers are \u201cconducting extensive password spraying\u201d against Office 365 accounts.Password-spraying is the process of trying a list of user names and a series of different passwords against online accounts in hopes of finding a match and gaining access to password-protected accounts. In this case, the attackers typically mount attacks on \u201cdozens to hundreds of accounts\u201d within each targeted organization, Microsoft said, and have been seen trying thousands of credential combinations against each account.So far, the campaign has targeted about 250 specific organizations that use Microsoft\u2019s cloud-based Office suite, with less than 20 of them suffering compromise, according to the company. However, \u201cDEV-0343 continues to evolve their techniques to refine its attacks,\u201d the computing giant warned.The attacks for now are being carried out using an emulated Firefox or Chrome browser, and rotating IP addresses hosted on a Tor proxy network, according to the analysis. On average, each attack uses between 150 and 1,000+ unique addresses, Microsoft said, in an elaborate effort to obfuscate the operational infrastructure.\u201cChanging the IP address for every password attempt is becoming a more common technique among sophisticated threat groups,\u201d according to the writeup. \u201cOften, threat groups randomize the user agent they are using as well as IP address. This technique has been enabled by the emergence of services providing huge numbers of residential IP addresses. These services are often enabled through malicious browser plugins.\u201dThis use of the proxy addresses makes developing indicators or compromise (IoCs) difficult, but the patterns that Microsoft has observed in the attacks include:Extensive inbound traffic from Tor IP addresses for password spray campaignsEmulation of FireFox (most common) or Chrome browsers in password spray campaignsEnumeration of Exchange ActiveSync (most common) or Autodiscover endpointsUse of enumeration/password spray tool similar to the \u201co365spray\u201d toolUse of Autodiscover to validate accounts and passwords\u201cThe operators typically target two Exchange endpoints \u2013 Autodiscover and ActiveSync \u2013 as a feature of the enumeration/password spray tool they use,\u201d according to Microsoft. \u201cThis allows DEV-0343 to validate active accounts and passwords, and further refine their password-spray activity.\u201dAlleged Links to IranThe group\u2019s \u201cDEV\u201d-based name is just Microsoft\u2019s temporary designation standing for a cluster of developing activity. Once more is known about the attackers, Microsoft will give it a permanent name.For now though, there\u2019s evidence that points to the threat actors being Iranian, it said. For instance, the attacks have specifically gone after companies that make military-grade radars, drone technology, satellite systems, emergency response communication systems, geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial analytics, Microsoft said, along with the ports and transportation companies. That dovetails with Iran\u2019s past attacks against shipping and maritime targets and overall goals, according to Microsoft.\u201cThis activity likely supports the national interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran based on pattern-of-life analysis, extensive crossover in geographic and sectoral targeting with Iranian actors, and alignment of techniques and targets with another actor originating in Iran,\u201d the company noted. \u201cMicrosoft assesses this targeting supports Iranian government tracking of adversary security services and maritime shipping in the Middle East to enhance their contingency plans\u2026Gaining access to commercial satellite imagery and proprietary shipping plans and logs could help Iran compensate for its developing satellite program.\u201dAlso, the group is most active between Sunday and Thursday between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. local Iran time, with Microsoft observing peak password-spray activity between 7:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.How to Protect Against Office 365 TakeoversTo protect against password-spraying attacks, Microsoft suggested that users first and foremost enable multifactor authentication.Otherwise, the company said that other defensive tactics include using passwordless solutions like Microsoft Authenticator to secure accounts; reviewing Exchange Online access policies; block ActiveSync clients from bypassing Conditional Access policies; and block all incoming traffic from anonymizing services where possible.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\u00a0Critical InfrastructureGovernmentWeb Security",

        "raw text": "U.S. law enforcement has shut down one of the largest cybercriminal online forums in the world and revealed the charges its Portuguese founder will face in federal court. However, the takedown is likely to only be a temporary blow to hackers, who will find other ways of buying and selling data stolen in cyber-attacks, security professionals noted.The Department of Justice (DoJ) unveiled Tuesday that it has seized three domains to affectively shut down the RaidForums website, a major English-language online marketplace for cybercriminals to buy and sell databases stolen from organizations in ransomware and other cyber-attacks. The domains seized by the feds after obtaining judicial authorization were \u201craidforums.com,\u201d \u201cRf.ws,\u201d and \u201cRaid.lol,\u201d according to a press release published Tuesday.The DoJ also unsealed charges being brought against RaidForums\u2019 founder and chief administrator, 21-year-old Portuguese citizen Diogo Santos Coelho, who was arrested in the United Kingdom on Jan. 31. He is being charged on six counts, including conspiracy, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft.The seizure of RaidForum\u2019s domains means that members can no longer use the site to traffic stolen data, according to the feds. Indeed, the site is well known among cybercriminal circles as an online hub for buying and selling data stolen in cyberattacks.Since its inception in 2015 RaidForums has sold access to more than 10 billion consumer records stolen in some of the world\u2019s largest data breaches. For example, data scraped from profiles of some 700 million LinkedIn users was posted for sale on the forum last June.\u201cThe takedown of this online market for the resale of hacked or stolen data disrupts one of the major ways cybercriminals profit from the large-scale theft of sensitive personal and financial information,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite of the DoJ\u2019s Criminal Division, in a press statement.Polite cited international collaboration with authorities in Portugal, the European Union and the United Kingdom as crucial to the collective law-enforcement effort that led to the seizure and arrest of Coelho.Temporary Disruption?In addition to being a blow, at least temporarily, to hackers, the takedown also is a warning to other hacker marketplaces that they could be next as the feds continue to crack down on cybercriminal activity, observed a security professional.\u201cIt\u2019s important in as much as it\u2019s disrupting a marketplace and creating additional difficulty and cost for cybercriminals who are looking to monetize their services and stolen data,\u201d Casey Ellis, founder and CTO at crowdsourced cybersecurity firm Bugcrowd, said in an email to Threatpost. \u201cIt\u2019s also a clear signal to other forum operators that they are in the DOJ\u2019s crosshairs.\u201dHowever, he said that the shutdown is unlikely to have a long-term impact on cybercriminal activity, as threat actors likely will just shift tactics and find other ways to profit from their nefarious activity.\u201cCybercrime, and its supporting criminal services are, by and large, incredibly successful and profitable for those who operate them, and business models like this tend to find a way to continue to exist,\u201d Ellis noted.Indeed, the shutdown of RaidForums merely presents an opportunity for other hacker forums to fill the \u201cnatural power vacuum\u201d it creates within the cybercriminal community, sending its members flocking to alternative dark web sites, noted another security professional.\u201cThe takedown of Raidforums is unlikely to result in a major disruption to overall cybercriminal activity; cybercriminals are well versed to platforms being taken down by [law enforcement] and so they remain agile and fluid as to where their next forum of choice is likely to pop-up,\u201d wrote Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at digital risk protection solution provider Digital Shadows, in an email to Threatpost.Hacker Hub Since 2015RaidForums went online in 2015, initially operating as an online venue for organizing and supporting forms of electronic harassment, according to the DoJ statement. This included \u201craiding,\u201d or posting or sending an overwhelming volume of contact to a victim\u2019s online communications medium, as well as \u201cswatting,\u201d the practice of making false reports to public safety agencies of situations that would necessitate a significant, and immediate armed law enforcement response.Between 2016 and 2022, RaidForums primarily served as a major online marketplace for individuals to buy and sell hacked or stolen databases that contain sensitive personal and financial information of victims of cyber-attacks in the United States and abroad.Stolen records that could be bought and sold on the forum included: stolen bank routing and account numbers, credit card information, login credentials and social security numbers, according to the feds.RaidForums acted on a membership business model, charging escalating prices for membership tiers that offered greater access and features, including a top-tier \u201cGod\u201d membership status, according to the DoJ.The forum also sold \u201ccredits\u201d that provided members access to privileged areas of the website to download stolen financial information, online credentials and personal identification data \u00a0from compromised databases, among other items.Members could also could earn credits through other means, such as by posting instructions on how to commit fraudulent acts online, according to the DoJ.Founder Facing ChargesCoelho is facing a six-count indictment in the Eastern District of Virginia for his role as the chief administrator of RaidForums, which he operated with the help of other website administrators, according to the DoJ.In his role, Coelho and his co-conspirators allegedly designed and administered the platform\u2019s software and computer infrastructure, established and enforced rules for its users, and created and managed sections of the website dedicated to promoting the buying and selling of illegally stolen data. For example, the site included a subforum titled \u201cLeaks Market,\u201d a self-described \u201cplace to buy/sell/trade databases and leaks.\u201dCoelho also personally sold stolen data on the platform, and directly facilitated illicit transactions by operating a fee-based \u201cOfficial Middleman\u201d service, according to the DoJ. In this service, Coelho allegedly acted as a trusted intermediary between RaidForums members seeking to buy and sell hacked data on RaidForums, officials said.Law-enforcement agencies that collaborated in the effort include: FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office, U.S. Secret Service, Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce (Europol), National Crime Agency (U.K.), Swedish Police Authority (Sweden), Romanian National Police (Romania), Judicial Police (Portugal), Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany) and others.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Enterprises are putting greater stock in cybersecurity, but outdated \u201csecurity by obscurity\u201d is still prevailing as companies wrestle with security awareness and shy away from bug-bounty programs.That\u2019s according to new survey data from HackerOne, which found that a full 65 percent of organizations surveyed claimed that they \u201cwant to be seen as infallible.\u201d However, just as many \u2013 64 percent \u2013 said they practice a culture of security through obscurity, where secrecy is used as the primary method of protecting sensitive systems and assets.Struggling with Security AwarenessWhen it comes to what\u2019s actually happening on the ground inside organizations, 57 percent of respondents in the report \u2013 \u201cThe Corporate Security Trap: Shifting Security Culture from Secrecy to Transparency\u201d \u2013 said that they struggle to create a culture of cybersecurity, and only 26 percent are \u201cvery confident\u201d that staff are following security practices.Worse, only 12 percent of departments outside of security and IT make cyber-awareness and training a core focus, according to the survey.And that\u2019s translating to trouble: About 63 percent said they\u2019ve had a security breach as a result of staff sidestepping security measures.Some of the issues come from the top: Only 29 percent of boards are \u201cdeeply involved\u201d in cybersecurity strategy; and 65 percent said that the idea that security slows innovation is telegraphed to them.Meanwhile, 63 percent of organizations said that they believe that cybersecurity is \u201cas important as cost when choosing a supplier,\u201d and 62 percent of organizations \u201cwould take their business elsewhere if a supplier suffered a data breach.\u201dThe Problem with SecrecyThus, perhaps it\u2019s no wonder that 38percent of respondents agreed that their organizations \u201caren\u2019t open about their cybersecurity practices.\u201dBut according to the authors of the report, this kind of approach is harmful, because \u201cby not admitting weaknesses and asking for help fixing them, organizations risk far more significant damage to their brand should a vulnerability be exploited.\u201d\u201cSunshine is the best medicine,\u201d wrote HackerOne CTO and co-founder Alex Rice, in the report. \u201cShining a light on the work to be done is the only way to win. We must stop asking security teams to toil away in obscurity.\u201dThe report suggested a few general changes organizations can make, like reporting breaches to stakeholders and publishing reports outlining security \u00a0measures that companies have in place. Another practical fix to a closed security culture would be putting into place Vulnerability Disclosure Policies (VDPs), bug-bounty programs and regular pentests that get third-party researchers involved.However, third-party vulnerability reporting comes with its own complications.The Controversy Around Bug BountiesMajor corporations like Google and Intel pay out thousands of dollars at a time \u2013 even millions of dollars every year \u2013 in bug-bounty programs. With the financial incentive to do so, outside researchers and friendly hackers help companies find zero-day vulnerabilities early, before the bad guys do.However, this new survey data shows that not everyone is on board, suggesting that not all security professionals are open to outside scrutiny. A full 67 percent of respondents said that they \u201cwould rather accept software vulnerabilities than work with hackers.\u201dAnd the hesitancy goes both ways. Ethical hackers are often dissuaded from reporting vulnerabilities to vendors, because they\u2019re so often ignored or outright attacked for doing so. In October, for example, the governor of Missouri launched a criminal investigation against a journalist who reported that the state\u2019s website was exposing hundreds of thousands of social security numbers on the web.It\u2019s no surprise, then, that 50 percent of hackers \u201chave not disclosed a bug because of a previous negative experience or lack of channels through which to report,\u201d according to the report.What Organizations Can DoTo establish trust and openness in corporate cybersecurity, HackerOne suggested four core tenets for corporate security responsibility. They are:Encouraging industry-wide transparency to build trust and share intelligence;Fostering a culture of industry-wide collaboration that gives everyone the tools to take control of reducing cyber-risk;Promoting innovation by inspiring development teams to build with security in mind and bring secure products to market faster;And holding oneself and suppliers accountable to following best practices to develop security as an easy point of differentiation.The stakes are high: About 53 percent of survey respondents admitted that \u201cthey have lost customers as a result of a security breach.\u201d Bottom line? The sooner organizations evolve to be more open and collaborative about security, the better off they \u2013 and the rest of us, by extension \u2013 will be.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The federal government is fighting back against what it says are China-based cyberattacks against U.S. universities and companies with indictments and a \u201cnaming-and-shaming\u201d approach \u2014 but researchers aren\u2019t convinced the efforts will come to much in terms of deterring future activity.On Monday, the White House released an official statement announcing its attempt to push back against \u201cirresponsible and destabilizing behavior in cyberspace.\u201d The European Union, the United Kingdom, and NATO countries also announced it will join the U.S. in \u201cexposing and criticizing [China\u2019s] malicious cyber-activities,\u201d the White House statement\u00a0added.The statement also formally attributed the widespread\u00a0Microsoft Exchange zero-day\u00a0exploitation to the China\u2019s Ministry of State Security.The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National Security Administration (NSA) released multiple advisories providing details about cybersecurity threats from the Chinese government, and announced the indictments of four Chinese nationals alleged to have been operating on behalf of the Chinese Hanian State Security Department.The indictments allege the four Chinese Hainan State Security Department (HSSD officers), were behind the advanced persistent threat group APT40: Including Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin and Zhu Yunmin, as well as Wu Shurong, who allegedly wrote and targeted malware\u00a0against universities, governments and companies across the globe between 2011 and 2018.\u201cThis indictment alleges a worldwide hacking and economic espionage campaign led by the government of China,\u201d said Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman of the Southern District of California, in a statement. \u201cThe defendants include foreign intelligence officials who orchestrated the alleged offenses, and the indictment demonstrates how China\u2019s government made a deliberate choice to cheat and steal instead of innovate.\u201dCISA and FBU have also released detailed\u00a0APT40 tactics, techniques and procedures\u00a0(TTPs) and\u00a0mitigations.Collective Cybersecurity Intelligence-Sharing Lisa Plaggemier, interim executive director of the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA) said this outspoken stance against China is new from the E.U. and NATO, and shows an encouraging move toward more open intelligence-sharing. She also pointed out that the U.S. could have announced sanctions against China, which it didn\u2019t do, signaling it is taking its allies\u2019 positions into account in developing countermeasures.\u201cGiven there were no direct sanctions levied at the current moment towards China \u2013 unlike in previous cases with Russian malicious cyber-activity \u2013 the fact that the E.U. and NATO outwardly condemned these actions \u2013 which is uncommon given their previous hesitancy to do so given deep ties between them \u2013 showcases that there is a unified front in combating this type of behavior moving forward,\u201d Plaggemier told Threatpost.That kind of inter-agency and international-government cooperation is important and can help deter future attacks, David Carrol, managing director for NTX Cyber at Nominet told Threatpost. But Carrol and Plaggemier, along with others, pointed out besides intelligence sharing and efforts to name and internationally shame the Chinese government for its actions, there\u2019s no actual consequence being imposed for the alleged data theft.\u201cGiven the ongoing rise in malicious activity, and the ratcheting up of tensions in the\u00a0Cyber Cold War, it is unlikely that these steps alone will halt this nefarious cyberactivity in its tracks,\u201d Plaggemier said.Carroll added, \u201cThe best means of preventing harm at scale from these types of cyberattacks is to combine collective intelligence with government intervention. With an adversary indiscriminately compromising so many servers and this becoming a familiar pattern of behavior, we need to deploy our own technologies that enact protection at scale.\u201dWhere\u2019s the Deterrent? Hitesh Sheth, president and CEO at Vectra, compared the APT40 indictments to last October\u2019s charges against Russian nationals accused of being tied to the Sandworm APT. Because Russia doesn\u2019t have any extradition agreements with the U.S., the indictments remain what Sheth called \u201csymbolic.\u201d\u201cFor this (or any deterrent) to matter, the targets have to care \u2013 and stand to pay some price by ignoring the action,\u201d Sheth said by email. \u201cFor a reminder of how effective such indictments are, hark back to last fall\u2019s grand jury indictments of Russian GRU officers on cybercrime charges. If they slowed Russian malware campaigns, it\u2019s hard to tell.\u201dCould Government Moves Increase Attacks? It\u2019s clear that while government posturing serves as a deterrent of decorum, it falls to individual organizations to protect themselves from these kinds of nation-state backed attacks.\u201cInternational cooperation, formal attribution, prosecution, sanctions, and other retorts and countermeasures, are all tools for driving more responsible state behavior in cyberspace,\u201d Amit Yoran, CEO of Tenable and former founding director of US-CERT at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, told Threatpost. \u201c[But] while governments focus on attribution, deterrence and response efforts, organizations are still responsible for exercising a standard of care when operating and securing their own systems.\u201dDirk Schrader from New Net Technologies said that he fears government gestures like these indictments could have the opposite effect as intended, and end up actually being detrimental to the country\u2019s security posture.\u201cAll these measures and ideas are more about licking our own wounds than influencing any nation-state APT group,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cThe security dilemma that western nations are facing can only be solved when defensive behavior gains the advantage. Any indications of intensifying on offensive measures will only lead to more intense cyberattacks.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentHacksMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a police officer who received money for obtaining data from a law-enforcement database for an associate did not violate a controversial federal hacking law, marking a victory for the ethical hacking community by limiting the law\u2019s scope.In a landmark ruling in Van Buren v. United States, the court ruled that former Georgia police sergeant Nathan Van Buren did not violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA) when he accessed a police database to retrieve information about a license plate in exchange for $6,000 in cash.Judges ruled in a 6-3 decision\u2013which now limits the scope of the CFAA\u2013that because Van Buren used his own credentials to access the information, he did not violate the law, \u201cwhich subjects to criminal liability anyone who \u2018intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,'\u201d according to the ruling.The court pointed to a number of structural issues with the law which go against the federal case for contending that Van Buren violated the CFAA. One of the keys to the decision is the phrase \u201cexceeds authorized access,\u201d which would suggest Van Buren overstepped his authority as a police officer in accessing the database that held the information that was exchanged, according to the ruling.\u201cThe relevant question, however, is not whether Van Buren exceeded his authorized access but whether he exceeded his authorized access as the CFAA defines that phrase,\u201d according to the ruling. \u201cFor reasons given elsewhere, he did not.\u201dCase HistoryThe case stems from an occurrence in which the FBI caught Van Buren using the computer in his patrol car to access the Georgia Crime Information Center (GCIC) database to obtain license-plate information in exchange for a cash payment from a person known to have ties to criminal activity.Though he used his own valid credentials to access the database, Van Buren\u2019s reason for using the computer was not consistent with performing his duties as a police officer, and he was brought up on federal criminal charges.The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia convicted him on two charges\u2013 violating his department\u2019s policy by obtaining database information for a personal purpose and violating the CFAA by using a computer network for purposes other than his police-officer duties. Van Buren was sentenced to 18 months in prison.The officer appealed the conviction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, where it was upheld. Eventually, it reached the Supreme Court and its aforementioned ruling in favor of Van Buren. The Supreme Court did uphold the previous judgment that Van Buren\u2019s actions violated his department\u2019s policy, however.Ramifications and DissentThe case is an important one especially for the ethical hacking community, for whom the CFAA has been historically troubling due to some of its wording, which could be interpreted in an over-reaching way to convict them of violating the law, security experts have said.The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) went a step further and declared the ruling \u201ca victory for all internet users,\u201d saying that it should now prevent misuse of the CFAA to \u201cprosecute beneficial and important online activity,\u201d according to a blog post published Thursday.\u201cIt affirmed that online services cannot use the CFAA\u2019s criminal provisions to enforce limitations on how or why you use their service, including for purposes such as collecting evidence of discrimination or identifying security vulnerabilities,\u201d according to the post, written by EFF Senior Staff Attorney Aaron Mackey and Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel Kurt Opsahl. \u201cIt also rejected the use of troubling physical-world analogies and legal theories to interpret the law, which in the past have resulted in some of its most dangerous abuses.\u201dThe three judges who disagreed with the ruling\u2013Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas\u2014believed that Van Buren breached the CFAA because he was forbidden to obtain the license-plate information for anything other than law-enforcement purposes.\u201cA person is entitled to do something only if he has a \u2018right\u2019 to do it,\u201d according to the dissenting opinion, penned by\u00a0 Roberts. \u201cVan Buren never had \u2018a right\u2019 to use the computer to obtain the specific license-plate information. Everyone agrees that he obtained it for personal gain, not for a valid law-enforcement purpose.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cA Walk On The Dark Side: A Pipeline Cyber Crisis Simulation\u201d\u2013 a LIVE interactive demo on Wed, June 9 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "The notorious FIN7 cybercrime gang, a financially motivated group, is spreading a backdoor called Lizar under the guise of being a Windows pen-testing tool for ethical hackers.According to the BI.ZONE Cyber Threats Research Team, FIN7 is pretending to be a legitimate organization that hawks a security-analysis tool. They go to great lengths for verisimilitude, researchers said: \u201cThese groups hire employees who are not even aware that they are working with real malware or that their employer is a real criminal group.\u201dSince 2015, FIN7 has targeted point-of-sale systems at casual-dining restaurants, casinos and hotels. The group typically uses malware-laced phishing attacks against victims in hopes they will be able to infiltrate systems to steal bank-card data and sell it. Since 2020, it has also added ransomware/data exfiltration attacks to its mix, carefully selecting targets according to revenue using the ZoomInfo service, researchers noted.Its choice of malware is always evolving, including occasionally using never-before-seen samples that surprise researchers. But its go-to toolkit has been Carbanak remote-access trojan (RAT), which previous analysis shows is highly complex and sophisticated compared with its peers: It\u2019s basically a Cadillac in a sea of golf carts. Carbanak is typically used for reconnaissance and establishing a foothold on networks.Lately, though, BI.ZONE researchers have noticed the group using a new type of backdoor, called Lizar. The latest version has been in use since February, and it offers a powerful set of data retrieval and lateral movement capabilities, according to an analysis published on Thursday.\u201cLizar is a diverse and complex toolkit,\u201d according to the firm. \u201cIt is currently still under active development and testing, yet it is already being widely used to control infected computers, mostly throughout the United States.\u201dVictims so far have included attacks on a gambling establishment, several educational institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., along with an IT company headquartered in Germany and a financial institution in Panama.Inside FIN7\u2019s Lizar ToolkitThe Lizar toolkit is structurally similar to Carbanak, researchers said. It consists of a loader and various plugins that are used for different tasks. Together they run on an infected system and can be combined into the Lizar bot client, which in turn communicates with a remote server.\u201cThe bot\u2019s modular architecture makes the tool scalable and allows for independent development of all components,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cWe\u2019ve detected three kinds of bots: DLLs, EXEs and PowerShell scripts, which execute a DLL in the address space of the PowerShell process.\u201dThe plugins are sent from the server to the loader and are executed when a certain action is performed in the Lizar client application, according to BI.ZONE.The six stages of the plugins\u2019 lifecycle are as follows:The user selects a command in the Lizar client application interface;The Lizar server receives the information about the selected command;The server finds a suitable plugin from the plugins directory, then sends it to the loader;The loader executes the plugin and stores the result of the plugin\u2019s execution in a specially allocated area of memory on the heap;The server retrieves the results of plugin execution and sends them on to the client; andThe client application displays the plugin results.The plugins are variously designed to load other tools like Mimikatz or Carbanak, retrieve information from the victim machine, take screenshots, harvest credentials, retrieve browser histories, and more.The specific bot commands are as follows:Command Line \u2013 get CMD on the infected system;Executer \u2013 launch an additional module;Grabber \u2013 run one of the plugins that collect passwords in browsers, Remote Desktop Protocol and Windows OS;Info \u2013 retrieve information about the system;Jump to \u2013 migrate the loader to another process;Kill \u2013 stop plugin;List Processes \u2013 get a list of processes;Mimikatz \u2013 run Mimikatz;Network analysis \u2013 run one of the plugins to retrieve Active Directory and network information;New session \u2013 create another loader session (run a copy of the loader on the infected system);Rat \u2013 run Carbanak; andScreenshot \u2013 take a screenshot.The Lizar server application, meanwhile, is written using the .NET framework and runs on a remote Linux host, researchers said. It supports encrypted communications with the bot client.\u201cBefore being sent to the server, the data is encrypted on a session key with a length ranging from 5 to 15 bytes and then on the key specified in the configuration (31 bytes),\u201d researchers explained. \u201cIf the key specified in the configuration (31 bytes) does not match the key on the server, no data is sent from the server.\u201dCybercriminals Posing as Security ResearchersThe impressively ironic tactic of posing as a security outfit while contributing to, well, insecurity is not a new idea, even for FIN7. In the past, BI.ZONE has observed it pushing Carbanak under the guise of the package being a tool from cybersecurity stalwarts Check Point Software or Forcepoint.Earlier this year, a North Korean advanced persistent threat group (APT) called Zinc, which has links to the more notorious APT Lazarus, mounted two separate attacks targeting security researchers.In January, the group used elaborate social-engineering efforts through Twitter and LinkedIn, as well as other media platforms like Discord and Telegram, to set up trusted relationships with researchers by appearing to themselves be legitimate researchers interested in offensive security.Specifically, attackers initiated contact by asking researchers if they wanted to collaborate on vulnerability research together. They demonstrated their own credibility by posting videos of exploits they\u2019ve worked on, including faking the success of a working exploit for an existing, patched Windows Defender vulnerability that had been exploited as part of the massive SolarWinds attack.Eventually, after much correspondence, attackers provided the targeted researchers with a Visual Studio Project infected with malicious code that could install a backdoor onto their system. Victims also could be infected by following a malicious Twitter link.Security researchers infected in those attacks were running fully patched and up-to-date Windows 10 and Chrome browser versions, according to Google TAG at the time, which signaled that hackers likely were using zero-day vulnerabilities in their campaign.Zinc was back at it in April, using some of the same social-media tactics but adding Twitter and LinkedIn profiles for a fake company called \u201cSecuriElite,\u201d which purported to be an offensive security firm located in Turkey. The company claimed to offer pen tests, software-security assessments and exploits, and purported to actively recruit cybersecurity personnel via LinkedIn.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "New research has found evidence that a Chinese-affiliated threat group (APT31) has hijacked a hacking tool previously used by the Equation Group (which has been tied to the U.S. National Security Agency, or NSA).The tool in question, dubbed \u201cJian,\u201d is used to exploit a local privilege-escalation (LPE) flaw in Windows, known as CVE-2017-0005. The exploit was previously discovered and linked to APT31.\u00a0However, new research by Check Point Research, released Monday, found that APT31 had actually stolen \u2013 and copied \u2013 the exploit from the Equation Group.In another twist,\u00a0researchers say the exploit was in use by APT31 in 2014, years before the ShadowBrokers leak\u00a0in 2017, which leaked a\u00a0cache of exploits that belonged to the Equation Group.Download the podcast here or listen to the episode below.\u201cAlthough we don\u2019t show any conclusive evidence that there is there any connection between China and the ShadowBrokers, we do show conclusive evidence that this Chinese group had in their possession a tool that was made by Equation Group, and not only that they had this tool, but they also repurposed it and used it, probably to attack many targets, including American targets,\u201d\u00a0Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research with Check Point Software, said.Balmas, along with Oded Vanunu, the head of products vulnerability research with Check Point Software, talk on this week\u2019s Threatpost podcast about the new discoveries around the NSA-linked exploit tools, as well as the implications of the SolarWinds supply-chain hack.Below is a lightly-edited transcript of the podcast.Lindsey Welch: Welcome to the Threatpost podcast. This is Lindsey Welch with Threatpost. I\u2019m joined today by Yaniv Balmas, the head of cyber research with Check Point Software and Oded Vanunu, the head of products vulnerability research with Check Point Software. Thank you both for joining me today just as Check Point kicks off its CPX 360 Americas conference. Exciting times.Yaniv Balmas: Nice to be here.Oded Vanunu: Hey.LW: Right, well, just to start today Check Point released new research doing a deep dive into how APT31, which is a Chinese-affiliated attack group, cloned and actively used a cyber offensive tool code from the Equation Group. Just to start, can you talk about kind of the biggest takeaways from this research and really give some context into what these big takeaways were.YB: Right so, I think everyone remembers the case with the ShadowBrokers. And their famous leak that happened around 2017. Leading to WannaCry, and many other attacks that actually we still see today. And that used some of the Equation Group\u2019s famous exploits like EternalBlue. And from many perspectives, even me personally, before we started this research, this was the end of the story. So you know, it was a mysterious group. They wanted to sell some tools online, they didn\u2019t manage to sell them, they leaked them. And what happened is what happened, Microsoft patched everything, case closed, story over. But what we show today shows or maybe sheds a different light on this on this story.Timeline of the events detailing the story of Jian. Credit: Check Point ResearchAnd although we don\u2019t show any conclusive evidence that you know, there is there any connection between China and the Shadow Brokers, however, we do show conclusive evidence that this Chinese group had in their possession, a tool that was made by Equation Group, and not only that they had this tool, but they also repurposed it and used it, probably to attack many targets, including American targets. Because one of the reported incidents was reported to Microsoft by Lockheed Martin\u2019s Incident Response Team.So we can\u2019t say for sure if Lockheed Martin themselves were the target or not. But I guess this suggests that this group was targeting some American targets at least, I think it\u2019s a pretty interesting development in this story, and it shows how cyber tools can be \u2013 sometimes they can be a good thing, sometimes they can be a double-edged sword \u2013 which is basically what [exploit tool] \u201cJian\u201d is, it is a Chinese double-edged sword.APT31 Stealing Equation Group Exploit ToolsLW: Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting. And just out of curiosity, how do you hypothesize that these Equation Group exploit samples could have been acquired by APT31? I know you talk a little bit about it in your research.YB: Yeah, so that\u2019s a point that we don\u2019t have any evidence for. However, there are several assumptions. And some of them we can rule out, based on our research. And some still remain open. So the ones that remain open, and the ones that we think are most probable are: One, it is possible, for example, that the Equation Group attacked some Chinese target. And this Chinese target was controlled by this Chinese group. For example, they had an incident response team, they managed to find the bridge, get ahold of the tools, and they took them and reverse engineered them, and repurposed them. So that\u2019s one scenario.Another possible scenario is that this Chinese group hacked into the Equation Group \u2013 \u00a0I think it\u2019s less probable, but still, it is a possibility. Another scenario might be that Equation Group used distant servers, so third-party servers, in order to conduct their attacks and maybe those servers were controlled by the Chinese as well.Also, the last scenario that I can say \u2013 this is something that history shows us that actually happens \u2013 is that this scenario can happen when both of these groups attack the same target. So they both attack the same target, they are both present on the same target. And once the Equation Group tries to use something on this target, the Chinese group immediately sees that, captures the tools, and you know the story from there.CVE-2017-0005: Local Privilege Escalation Windows FlawLW: Right, right. And just for context, can you tell us a little bit about the tool itself, as being an exploit for the Windows LPE flaw, CVE-2017-0005? Can you talk a little bit just about how that exploit was being deployed? And are these two clone samples the exact same? Do they work or operate differently or were they being deployed differently at all?YB: Right, so yeah, as you mentioned, that exploit itself is exploiting LPE, which means local privilege escalation. This kind of exploit or vulnerability is usually used as a second stage in an attack. So the common scenario is that you attack some targets, and you get a foothold in it. However, you still don\u2019t have enough permissions, you can\u2019t really do whatever you want on this target. And in order to do that, you need a second exploit. And this is an LPE exploit that you need. So they are very commonly used within offensive operations. So that\u2019s a bit about the nature of the vulnerability itself. Regarding the exploitation and the tools that we see, they are actually pretty interesting, because the Equation Group tool that \u2013 by the way, it was leaked as part of the official ShadowBroker leak, so we can see it \u2013 it\u2019s actually part of a bigger infrastructure that was made by the Equation Group. This infrastructure is referred to as DanderSpritz. That\u2019s the name, they gave it. By the way, one of the things that we found interesting is that this specific vulnerability wasn\u2019t actually talked about a lot in the research community. It seems like it was forgotten probably because it was so big, that probably some pieces of it still remain, you know, unanalyzed. So that was interesting to see. By the way, it shows that it\u2019s always good to revisit all the leaks and all the vulnerabilities. And as I mentioned, the exploit was part of this module. So it actually contains parts that are not directly related to the vulnerability itself, they\u2019re kind of part of this big framework.And that\u2019s interesting, because the Chinese tool that we got is using; first of all, it\u2019s exploiting exactly the same vulnerability. And what we see is that the Chinese exploit is different. It\u2019s kind of a Chinese copy of this exploit. Why do I say that? Because it contains a lot of things that were part of this framework, of the DanderSpritz framework. The Chinese group used it as a standalone tool. So it\u2019s actually very conclusive evidence that this tool was actually copied from this American tool. So it\u2019s pretty interesting to see that.I think the American tool seems to be much more mature, much more elegant in the way it\u2019s written. And the Chinese tool is really more of a copy of that. When you look at it, it seems like, they didn\u2019t know exactly what they were doing. And they were afraid to change some things. And we didn\u2019t know if they are related or not related. So it\u2019s much more fragile. It looks much less elegant. But I think the bottom line is the most important thing is that it works. And it works really well.Solar Winds Supply-Chain Attack: How it Will Change the Cybersecurity LandscapeLW: Right, right. Well, that\u2019s this is really interesting research and I know too also during CPX, that you will be discussing Sunburst, which is, you know, the malware installed on SolarWinds\u2019\u00a0Orion product line and the SolarWinds supply chain attack, and really how that is influencing supply-chain attacks in the future and kind of what\u2019s to come there. So can you either of you talk a little bit more about Sunburst and SolarWinds\u00a0and really what you\u2019ve seen there from your perspective?OV: Yes, of course. So as I started to discuss it, me and Yaniv had a lot of discussion about Sunburst \u2013 and we both define it as one of the biggest events in the cybersecurity industry ever, and I think that this is just the tip of the iceberg. With this attack, the entire industry learned a lot and I think that a lot of things will be changed in the way of how we protect things, and how we trust third parties. This is something that will change a lot of the concept.Microsoft SolarWinds cyberattack victim breakdown. Credit: MicrosoftSo, basically, a supply-chain attack is an attack that you choose a target and this target, you find it as secure and hard to attack. And then when you have this kind of condition, you are looking for what we call a supply-chain attack, and you find someone that provides services \u2013 in our case, it can be a software services \u2013 and this target is less secure and an easier way to access your target.And supply-chain attacks are not something new, we saw that on Target and NotPetya that were active in the last few years. And but in the case of SolarWinds, it seems that the attack or the initiation of the attack was to achieve what we call high-volume vendors. And we know that SolarWinds customers or most of their customers are Fortune 500 companies and just to think that FireEye was the one that identify the SolarWinds attack after like, almost nine months, after there was like a some kind of code change in SolarWind\u2019s code repository. It just gives us the sense of the size of this attack, and how much we don\u2019t know about this attack.LW:Yeah, definitely. It is such a massive hack. I mean, I\u2019m curious, either Oded or Yuniv what your thoughts are, on what implications this has, either for companies, Oded you mentioned Fortune 500 companies being affected by this. Obviously government agencies in the U.S., security vendors \u2014 How do you see the implications of this running as we kind of look to the future?The Future of Supply-Chain AttacksYB: You know, first of all, as Oded said before, I think this is one of the most dramatic and biggest advance that I think both of us ever saw, and we\u2019ve been in this field for the past, I don\u2019t know, 20 years, something like that.So it\u2019s really something very dramatic. And in the amount of targets that they were able to get into is simply astonishing. And I think we still don\u2019t know the full path and what it means. And I think we\u2019ll slowly find it out during the next few months or a few years.For me, personally, what I find most disturbing is that, you know, this thing was kind of caught by mistake, I think you can you can you can clearly say that. I mean, it could have easily gone under the radar if FireEye wouldn\u2019t have caught it on their networks, if they wouldn\u2019t have done so, we wouldn\u2019t be having this talk and, you know, think about it, all of this would have happened without anyone knowing about it. And I think for me, that\u2019s the most scary thing about this thing, how many of these attacks go on unnoticed.OV: Just to emphasize, Yaniv, what you said, which is like, so dramatic; in this case FireEye, the trigger for their investigation was that they saw a second phone number registered for one of their employees. That was like the trigger, that was the abnormality that was like breaking and from this point, that was the beginning of investigating Sunburst, just because they saw that there is another phone number registered for their employees, because this is a violation, a policy violation that other employees have only one phone connected for their second factor authentication. And it\u2019s, the scale and the sophistication, it\u2019s dramatic on all levels.SolarWinds: How to Mitigate Against Future AttacksLW: Right. And with such small clues like that, and such this high level of sophistication, what can companies do in the future to try to prevent something like this from happening again, or amping up their detection methods? Or, you know, what really can we do to prevent another SolarWinds from happening?YB: It\u2019s a really hard question, to answer. And I think it\u2019s something that most organizations around the world are still debating and thinking about, and trying to understand. If you have SolarWinds installed, if you don\u2019t have SolarWinds installed, I think everyone should consider himself as being the target of this and look under every rock in your network. In fact, think about, what will they do next time? How would I be able to detect it? How would I be able to prevent it? There are so many ways and so many possibilities. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask anyone, to give any conclusive solution for this, in such a short time, I think we need more time to understand I think we need to be more aware of this, I think we need to strengthen our defenses. I think we need to prepare the right procedures for this. And I see it in Check Point, I see it in other places as well, I think we\u2019re going this way. And I think at the end of the day\u2026 the security community, and the world will get out of it stronger and better and more secure.OV: And in my perspective, to continue what Yaniv said. So in general, organizations when they define security of their assets, they\u2019re usually defined what is like critical business and what is less critical business. And the subjects of supply chain was something that was raised in the last few years. But the specific subject of software update supply chain was something that was like, in the side, it was still a trusted domain, it was still a place. That organizations didn\u2019t do dramatic security change in terms of like they were more trusting their software vendors with their updates. I think that starting from Sunburst scares, this agenda, this lookout is going to change. It means that you will not trust software updates anymore, and there should be more security consideration on these phases in my opinion.LW: Right, well, I will be very curious to see how things change in the future. And those are those are really good points. So Yuniv, Oded, thank you so much for joining me today on the Threatpost podcast to discuss Check Point\u2019s new research, as well as your perspectives on the SolarWinds supply-chain attack.OV, YB: Thank you very much.LW: To all of our listeners.

        "raw text": "Ticketmaster must pay a hefty $10 million fine after several employees utilized unlawfully obtained passwords to hack a rival company\u2019s computer systems \u2013 in attempts to \u201cchoke off\u201d its business.The American ticket sales and distribution giant, which is owned by Live Nation, in 2013 hired an employee who formerly worked for Ticketmaster\u2019s rival company (reported by some outlets to be Songkick, a now-defunct company that offered concert pre-sale tickets), according to the Department of Justice (DoJ) last week.This co-conspirator illegally retained credentials from the rival firm, which he and other Ticketmaster executives then used to hack into the victim company\u2019s systems. From there, they were able to monitor the company\u2019s draft ticketing web pages, allowing them to find out which artists planned to use the rival company to sell tickets. They were also able to hack into and snoop on the company\u2019s Artist Toolbox, a password-protected app that provides real-time data about ticket sales.\u201cWhen employees walk out of one company and into another, it\u2019s illegal for them to take proprietary information with them,\u201d said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney in a statement. \u201cTicketmaster used stolen information to gain an advantage over its competition, and then promoted the employees who broke the law. This investigation is a perfect example of why these laws exist \u2014 to protect consumers from being cheated in what should be a fair market place.\u201dThe HackAccording to court documents, the former senior employee (who as of now remains unnamed) of the victim company worked there between May 2010 to July 2012. In 2012, he signed a separation agreement with the victim company upon leaving, in which he agreed to maintain the confidentiality of that company\u2019s sensitive data, before joining Live Nation in August 2013.In 2013, this former employee shared with former Ticketmaster head of the Artist Services division Zeeshan Zaidi the URLs for draft ticketing web pages of the victim company, which were not public.\u201cIn response to a Ticketmaster executive explaining that the goal was to \u2018choke off [victim company]\u2019 and \u2018steal back one of [the victim company]\u2019s signature clients,\u2019 co-conspirator 1 offered that Ticketmaster could \u2018cut [victim company] off at the knees\u2019 if they could win back presale ticketing business for a second major artist that was a client of the victim company,\u201d according to the DoJ.Then, the former employee sent Zaidi and another Ticketmaster executive multiple sets of usernames and passwords for the victim company\u2019s password-protected Artist Toolbox app, and encouraged them to \u201cscreen-grab the hell out of the system.\u201d The co-conspirators even went so far as to use the passwords to access the app in a live demo at a Ticketmaster internal summit, in front of at least 14 other Ticketmaster and Live Nation employees, according to the DoJ.The former employee in 2015 was promoted and given a raise; meanwhile, Ticketmaster employees continued to access the Artist Toolbox app through December 2015.Next StepsIn 2015, the victim company filed a civil complaint against Live Nation and Ticketmaster alleging antitrust violations. That lawsuit was amended in 2017 to add allegations that Ticketmaster had accessed the company\u2019s computer systems without authorization. In 2017, both the former employee and Zaidu were then terminated by Ticketmaster.Last week\u2019s fine against Ticketmaster resolves charges that the company \u201crepeatedly accessed without authorization the competitor\u2019s computer systems.\u201d The fine is part of a deferred prosecution agreement that Ticketmaster entered with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of New York to resolve a five-count criminal complaint filed today charging computer intrusion and fraud offenses. As part of the charges, on Oct. 18, 2019, Zaidi pled guilty in a related case to conspiring to commit computer intrusions and wire fraud based on his participation in this scheme.This is also not the first time Ticketmaster has found itself up against a hefty fine for cybersecurity-related issues. In November, Ticketmaster\u2019s U.K. division was slapped with a $1.65 million fine by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) in the UK, over its 2018 data breach that impacted 9.4 million customers.The incident points to employee insider threats facing many companies \u2013 an issue that is particularly worrying today as many may feel stressed or disillusioned by their workplace during today\u2019s shaky, COVID-19-disrupted economy.\u00a0One specific concern for companies reflected by this particular case is illegal employee data retention after leaving a firm. For instance, last year a former Cisco employee was sentenced to two years in jail after he hacked into Cisco\u2019s Webex collaboration platform \u2013 after leaving the firm.A Ticketmaster spokesperson told Threatpost, \u201cTicketmaster terminated both Zaidi and Mead in 2017, after their conduct came to light. Their actions violated our corporate policies and were inconsistent with our values. We are pleased that this matter is now resolved.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "Imagine someone hacking into an Amazon Alexa device using a laser beam and then doing some online shopping using that person account. This is a scenario presented by a group of researchers who are exploring why digital home assistants and other sensing systems that use sound commands to perform functions can be hacked by light.The same team that last year mounted a signal-injection attack against a range of smart speakers merely by using a laser pointer are still unraveling the mystery of why the microelectro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones in the products turn the light signals into sound.Researchers at the time said that they were able to launch inaudible commands by shining lasers \u2013 from as far\u00a0 as 360 feet \u2013 at the microphones on various popular voice assistants, including Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Facebook Portal, and Google Assistant.\u201c[B]y modulating an electrical signal in the intensity of a light beam, attackers can trick microphones into producing electrical signals as if they are receiving genuine audio,\u201d said researchers at the time.Now, the team\u2013 Sara Rampazzi, an assistant professor at the University of Florida; and Benjamin Cyr and Daniel Genkin, a PhD student and an assistant professor, respectively, at the University of Michigan \u2014 has expanded these light-based attacks beyond the digital assistants into other aspects of the connected home.Demonstration of Light Commands vulnerability and exploitation on MEMS microphones.They broadened their research to show how light can be used to manipulate a wider range of digital assistants\u2014including Amazon Echo 3 \u2014 but also sensing systems found in medical devices, autonomous vehicles, industrial systems and even space systems.The researchers also delved into how the ecosystem of devices connected to voice-activated assistants \u2014 such as smart-locks, home switches and even cars \u2014 also fail under common security vulnerabilities that can make these attacks even more dangerous. The paper shows how using a digital assistant as the gateway can allow attackers to take control of other devices in the home: Once an attacker takes control of a digital assistant, he or she can have the run of any device connected to it that also responds to voice commands. Indeed, these attacks can get even more interesting if these devices are connected to other aspects of the smart home, such as smart door locks, garage doors, computers and even people\u2019s cars, they said.\u201cUser authentication on these devices is often lacking, allowing the attacker to use light-injected voice commands to unlock the target\u2019s smartlock-protected front doors, open garage doors, shop on e-commerce websites at the target\u2019s expense, or even unlock and start various vehicles connected to the target\u2019s Google account (e.g., Tesla and Ford),\u201d researchers wrote in their paper.The team plans to present the evolution of their research at Black Hat Europe on Dec. 10, though they acknowledge they still aren\u2019t entirely sure why the light-based attack works, Cyr said in a report published on Dark Reading.\u201cThere\u2019s still some mystery around the physical causality on how it\u2019s working,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating that more in-depth.\u201dThe attack that researchers outlined last year leveraged the design of of smart assistants\u2019 microphones \u2014 the last generation of Amazon Echo, Apple Siri, Facebook Portal and Google Home \u2014 and was dubbed \u201clight commands.\u201dResearchers focused on the MEMs microphones, which work by converting sound (voice commands) into electrical signals. However, the team said that they were able to launch inaudible commands by shining lasers \u2014 from as far as 110 meters, or 360 feet \u2014 at the microphones.The team does offer some mitigations for these attacks from both software and hardware perspectives. On the software side, users can add an extra layer of authentication on devices to \u201csomewhat\u201d prevent attacks, although usability can suffer, researchers said.In terms of hardware, reducing the amount of light that reaches the microphones by using a barrier or diffracting film to physically block straight light beams \u2014 allowing soundwaves to detour around the obstacle \u2014 could help mitigate attacks, they said.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.

        "raw text": "UPDATEFive alleged members of the APT41 threat group have been indicted by a federal grand jury, in two separate actions that were unsealed this week.Meanwhile, the Department of Treasury also imposed sanctions on individuals and organizations associated with Iran-linked APT39.APT41 (a.k.a. Barium, Winnti, Wicked Panda or Wicked Spider) is known for nation-state-backed cyber-espionage activity as well as financial cybercrime. The Department of Justice alleges that the group \u201cfacilitated the theft of source code, software code-signing certificates, customer-account data and valuable business information,\u201d which in turn \u201cfacilitated other criminal schemes, including ransomware and cryptojacking.\u201dThe five suspected perpetrators, all of whom are residents and nationals of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), are charged with hacking more than 100 victim companies in the United States and abroad, including software-development companies, computer-hardware manufacturers, telecom providers, social-media companies, video-game companies, nonprofit organizations, universities, think tanks and foreign governments, as well as pro-democracy politicians and activists in Hong Kong.According to John Hultquist, senior director of analysis at Mandiant Threat Intelligence, APT41 has been the most prolific Chinese threat actor tracked by the firm in the last year.\u201cThis is a unique actor, who carries out global cyber-espionage while simultaneously pursuing a criminal venture,\u201d he said via email. \u201cTheir activity traces back to 2012, when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video-game industry, before expanding into traditional espionage, most likely directed by the state. APT41\u2019s ability to successfully blend their criminal and espionage operations is remarkable.\u201dLately, APT41 has been involved in several high-profile supply chain incidents according to Mandiant, which often blended its criminal interest in video games with the espionage activity.\u201cFor instance, they compromised video-game distributors to proliferate malware, which could then be used for follow-up operations,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have also been connected to well-known incidents involving Netsarang and ASUS updates.\u201dIn terms of targeted sectors, APT41 has been focused on telecom, travel and hospitality \u2013 likely because it has been looking to \u201cidentify, monitor and track individuals of interest, operations which could have serious, even physical consequences for some victims,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have also participated in efforts to monitor Hong Kong during recent democracy protests.\u201dIntellectual property theft is on the menu too, Hultquist said, when it comes to medical institutions and medical technology, likely related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201cThe scope and sophistication of the crimes in these unsealed indictments is unprecedented. The alleged criminal scheme used actors in China and Malaysia to illegally hack, intrude and steal information from victims worldwide,\u201d said Michael Sherwin, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, in a DoJ statement this week. \u201cAs set forth in the charging documents, some of these criminal actors believed their association with the PRC provided them free license to hack and steal across the globe. This scheme also contained a new and troubling cybercriminal component \u2013 the targeting and utilization of gaming platforms to both defraud video game companies and launder illicit proceeds.\u201dSpecific ChargesIn terms of the specifics, an August 2019 indictment charged Zhang Haoran and Tan Dailin with 25 counts of conspiracy, wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, money laundering and violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). The second indictment, from August of this year, charged Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan and Fu Qiang with nine counts of racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to violate the CFAA, substantive violations of the CFAA, access device fraud, identity theft, aggravated identity theft and money laundering.The second August 2020 indictment charged Wong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching. They were charged with 23 counts of racketeering, conspiracy, identity theft, aggravated identity theft, access device fraud, money laundering, violations of the CFAA and falsely registering domain names.\u00a0 The indictment alleged that Wong and Ling worked with various hackers, including Zhang and Tan, to profit from the hackers\u2019 criminal computer intrusions at video game companies.All of them are still at large.The same federal grand jury also returned a third indictment charging two APT41 associates: Both are Malaysian businessmen, who are accused of targeting the video-game industry and aiding APT41 in its efforts to monetize its activities. The duo was arrested on Monday in by Malaysian authorities in Sitiawan; they are now awaiting extradition.The charges against all of the defendants carry maximum sentences that range between two and 20 years in prison.Infrastructure Sinkholing In tandem with the indictments, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia this month also paved the way for the seizure hundreds of accounts, servers, domain names and command-and-control (C2) servers used by the defendants to conduct their computer intrusion offenses. The FBI executed a series of warrants in coordination with the private sector, including Microsoft, to deny APT41 access to its hacking infrastructure, various accounts for services that it abuses, and C2 domains.\u201cThe Department of Justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer intrusions and cyberattacks by these Chinese citizens,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. \u201cRegrettably, the Chinese communist party has chosen a different path of making China safe for cybercriminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal intellectual property helpful to China.\u201dAPT39 SanctionsAs for APT39, the Treasury Department said on Thursday that masked behind its front company, Rana Intelligence Computing Co., the government of Iran used the advanced persistent threat group to carry out a years-long malware campaign that targeted Iranian dissidents, journalists and international companies in the travel sector.Victims of APT39\u2019s activity have been \u201csubjected to arrest and physical and psychological intimidation\u201d by Iran\u2019s Ministry of Intelligence, according to a press release.The department named 45 individuals in addition to Rana and APT39, and prohibits U.S. citizens or businesses to interact with them for any financial or commercial purpose.\u201cWe believe the actor, who we have tracked for over five years, is enabling Iranian surveillance,\u201d Mandiant\u2019s Hultquist said. \u201cThe actor has focused heavily on the telecommunications and travel industries as part of an effort to collect customer data and personal information on targets of interest. These efforts could threaten the customers of victim organizations who may then be physically endangered by the Iranian security services.\u201dLessons in DefenseAPT41 and APT39 are just two of many advanced threat groups that target businesses and civil society on behalf of foreign governments \u2013 something that organizations need to be aware of, researchers told Threatpost.\u201cAs highlighted in the recent report from the Atlantic Council, the techniques alleged to have been used by the defendants (supply-chain attacks and use of publicly known exploits in commercial and open-source software),continue to be popular and powerful attack vectors for threat actors, both large and small,\u201d Zach Jones, senior director of detection research at WhiteHat Security, told Threatpost. \u201cThis case, one of hundreds known publicly over the past two decades, highlights the continued need for increased focus on securing the software that our digital lives depend on.\u201dTo protect themselves, organizations first and foremost should patch vulnerabilities, in both commercial and proprietary software that may have been built on open code bases, he added.Meanwhile, Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at Lookout, told Threatpost the indictments indicate how malicious actors are diversifying their tactics to achieve a broader range of outcomes \u2013 something that organizations should take note of.\u201cIn particular, breaching gaming companies to steal in-game items and currency for real-world profit rather than stealing corporate data means security teams need to be sure their efforts are well-distributed across both internal and external systems,\u201d he said \u2013 especially as more people are working from home. \u201cThe attackers were able to gain access to internal networks and likely moved laterally across the infrastructure to identify the most profitable items.\u201dUnauthorized access to the infrastructure often starts with a phishing attack, he warned.\u201cThreat actors will target particular employees and phish their credentials in order to get access to particular parts of the infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, phishing attacks primarily start outside of the traditional email channels. The primary channels are now SMS, social media platforms, third-party chat platforms, direct messages in gaming apps, and others that are primarily accessed on mobile devices.\u201dThe onslaught of sophisticated, high-end cyber-activity is unlikely to wane, even with high-profile indictments like this one, Mandiant\u2019s Hultquist concluded.\u201cIntelligence services leverage criminals such as APT41 for their own ends because they are an expedient, cost-effective and deniable capability,\u201d he said. \u201cAPT41\u2019s criminal operations appear to predate the work they do on behalf of the state and they may have been co-opted by a security service who would have significant leverage over them. In situations such as this, a bargain can be reached between the security service and the operators wherein the operators enjoy protection in return for offering high-end talent to the service. Furthermore, the service enjoys a measure in deniability when the operators are identified. Arguably, that is the case right now.\u201dThis post was updated at 4:45 p.m. ET to include information about sanctions on APT39.Cloud SecurityGovernmentHacksMalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 \u00a0Cybersecurity experts have long stayed in their problem-solving lane when it comes to finding vulnerabilities, patching bugs and keeping networks safe. But maybe it is time they applied their defensive skillsets and adversarial understanding of cyberthreats to help solve some of today\u2019s most complex social issues.Speaking at the RSA Conference 2020 on Thursday, security technologist Bruce Schneier called for a better cooperation between security experts and government policymakers. The premise being, cybersecurity often requires nonlinear problem-solving, a quality conventional bureaucrats often lack.From education systems to election structures, society is built on conventional \u201cmodels\u201d that made sense when they were first formed hundreds of years ago, said Schneier, a lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School. But these \u201cgood faith\u201d models can\u2019t keep up with constantly evolving threats and unanticipated societal changes.[For Threatpost\u2019s complete RSA Conference 2020 reporting, please visit our special coverage section, available here.]Meanwhile, cybersecurity researchers spend their days looking for threats that could crop up in various products and software. Security experts need to be proactive in thinking about how attackers are constantly shifting their tactics, techniques and procedures and how those changes will impact security risks.With that in mind, Schneier asked, \u201cCan our expertise in IT security transfer to broader social systems, like tax code, like the system we use to choose our elected officials, like the market economy? Is our way of thinking in analytical frameworks valuable in a larger context? Can we hack society?\u201dTake, for instance, the complex federal tax code, which is made up of thousands of pages detailing rules for individuals and businesses to follow to determine what percentage of their incomes need to be forked over to the federal and state government. A \u201chacker mindset\u201d could be helpful in looking at tax code and asking questions around who audits it, who pays for it, how the code can be patched, or how a security system could be designed to deal with discovered tax-related \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a unique skill set to understand technical systems with human dimensions, and to think about systems with an adversarial mindset,\u201d said Schneier.The security space views a hack as something that a system allows, but that is unwanted by the system designers \u2013 and can lead to an exploitation of the system by an attacker. This definition of a \u201chack\u201d can be also applied to society, where systems have been created for societal models that are constantly becoming outdated, based on changes in scale or circumstance, Schneier contended.For instance, the legislative process is often so complex and difficult to understand, yet it allows for loopholes. Also, while conservative investment markets are based on knowledgeable buyers making decisions among competing products, a venture capitalist can end-run the \u201csystem\u201d and fund (or \u201chack\u201d) a startup, allowing it to take on risk in the hopes of quick success.Schneier said the same cybersecurity-mindset can be applied to election security. It is also continually shifting, as the emergence of social media has created a ripple effect of disinformation that eventually has consequences on voting results.When looking at how to solve these societal issues, policy makers need to ask themselves many of the same questions that security experts ask everyday. What are policy makers trying to protect? What are the risks? How well are the risks evaluated? What other risks do the solutions cause and what are the non-security trade offs?\u201cWe need to upend the idea that society is stable,\u201d said Schneier. \u201cWe built society and now we\u2019re building it increasingly with technology.\u201d Hacking society, in this context, is a natural extension of traditional problem solving.This week at RSA, others have discussed the advantages of the security space branching its skillsets out to other industries.A panel of experts discussing the legal policies available for machine learning attacks worried that a lack of laws swing open the door for bad guys to attack systems. Wendy Nather, head of advisory CISOs at Cisco, told a keynote audience that the security space needs to shift its relationship with other industries.\u00a0\u201cWe have to open up our security culture to everybody,\u201d she said on Tuesday. \u201cSecurity needs to be basic knowledge and freely available. We can\u2019t shoehorn people into our narrow society culture.\u201dGovernmentPrivacyRSAC",

        "raw text": "U.S. authorities have charged four Chinese military officers in the 2017 Equifax data breach, which compromised the data of nearly 150 million.The four, Wu Zhiyong, Wang Qian, Xu Ke and Liu Lei, are believed to be members of the 54th Research Institute of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), a component of the Chinese military. The Department of Justice (DoJ) alleges that they hacked into the credit reporting agency\u2019s network on the hunt for sensitive Equifax consumer data, as well as valuable Equifax trade secrets.\u201cThis was a deliberate and sweeping intrusion into the private information of the American people,\u201d said Attorney General William P. Barr, in a Monday announcement. \u201cToday, we hold PLA hackers accountable for their criminal actions, and we remind the Chinese government that we have the capability to remove the Internet\u2019s cloak of anonymity and find the hackers that nation repeatedly deploys against us.\u201dThe four, who are still at large, allegedly exploited the flaw in the Apache Struts Web Framework in Equifax\u2019s online dispute portal to obtain login credentials, which they then used to further navigate the company\u2019s network. Over several weeks, they accused of then running 9,000 queries to sniff out and exfiltrate sensitive customer data, including Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and some driver\u2019s license numbers, as well as Equifax trade secret information (including data compilations and database designs).To avoid detection, the four allegedly routed traffic through 34 servers located in nearly 20 countries, used encrypted communication channels within Equifax\u2019s network to blend in with normal network activity. They are also accused of deleting compressed files and wiping log files on a daily basis in an effort to eliminate records of their activity.Charges against the four include counts of conspiracy to commit computer fraud, conspiracy to commit economic espionage, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud; as well as counts of unauthorized access and intentional damage to a protected computer, economic espionage and wire fraud. The investigation was conducted jointly by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Criminal and National Security Divisions of the Department of Justice, and the FBI\u2019s Atlanta Field Office. Equifax cooperated fully and provided valuable assistance in the investigation, according to the DoJ.\u201cThe U.S. government is showing that despite the best efforts of the attackers, [they] are able to trace those attacks back to the source and provide specific attribution of the attack,\u201d Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cThis is even though the attackers leveraged multiple tricks to obfuscate their presence, including encrypted hidden tunnels to multiple destinations in nearly 20 countries. Attribution helps to understand how data would be used and for what purpose.\u201dIt\u2019s only the second time that Chinese army officers have been charged by U.S. authorities for hacks. The last time was in 2014, when the DoJ indicted five officers of the Chinese PLA for allegedly hacking into networks run by companies such as U.S. Steel, Westinghouse and Alcoa and stealing proprietary information that allegedly then was passed on to Chinese-owned companies.\u201cUnfortunately, the Equifax hack fits a disturbing and unacceptable pattern of state-sponsored computer intrusions and thefts by China and its citizens that have targeted personally identifiable information, trade secrets, and other confidential information,\u201d said Barr in a statement.Equifax, which handles data associated with more than 820 million customers and 91 million businesses worldwide, has been under public scrutiny since September 2017 when\u00a0it disclosed\u00a0the data breach. In January 2020, a Georgia court granted final approval for an Equifax settlement in a class-action lawsuit, in which Equifax will pay $380.5 million to settle lawsuits regarding\u00a0the 2017 data breach. In addition, Equifax may be required to dole out an additional $125 million \u201cif needed to satisfy claims for certain out-of-pocket losses.\u201dLearn how Operational Technology and Information Technology systems are merging and changing security playbooks in this free Threatpost Webinar.

        "raw text": "White hats aren\u2019t alone in holding hacking contests. Russian-language cybercriminals are known for running similar competitions on underground forums. However, an analysis of Dark Web activity has uncovered a trend towards offering increasingly high-stakes prizes during such battles. At the same time, increasingly sophisticated participants are throwing their hats into the mix \u2014 notably, the operators behind the Sodinokibi (a.k.a. REvil) ransomware.For instance, a current hacking competition on the illicit forum known as XSS offers members the chance to win a share of $15,000 in return for original articles containing proof-of-concept videos or original code, according to a Digital Shadows report, released on Thursday.\u201cSince its relaunch as XSS [in 2018], the former Damagelabs has organized three articles competitions, all with four- or five-figure prize funds,\u201d the firm noted.In the past, competitions on underground forums offered much smaller prize winnings and also focused on lighthearted challenges meant to build community, rather than hacking prowess. For instance, a 2010 competition challenged participants \u201cto design a graphic that best represented the Russian-language segment of the internet (the \u2018Runet\u2019) to win an iPad,\u201d according to Digital Shadows.A more skills-based challenge emerged on the Exploit underground forum in December 2016, when a $2,000 pot was offered for the best articles on broad topics like \u201cmalware\u201d, \u201cphreaking\u201d and \u201chacking.\u201d The event has become an annual winter tradition, but Digital Shadows said that this year the prize levels soared.\u201cFast-forward to 2019 and the competition prize fund stood at $10,000, with rules stipulating a word count and content requirements,\u201d the research detailed.Sodinokibi Sponsors $15K CompetitionThe recently bigger prizes have attracted new interest from advanced threat groups, the firm said. For instance, Sodinokibi\u2019s operators have\u00a0stepped forward to sponsor the aforementioned XSS event, which is open now for entries.In this latest competition, articles can be submitted on five different topics:Searching for 0day and 1day vulnerabilities. Developing exploits for themAPT attacks. Hacking LAN, elevating rights, hijacking domain controller, attack developmentInteresting combinations, algorithms. Writing your own crypto algorithms and hacking other people\u2019sInnovative functionality, reviews, analysis of interesting algorithms that are used, development prospectsDigital forensics. Software, tricks, methodsThe competition winner will win $5,000, with prizes decreasing by $1,000 incrementally for second through fifth place, totaling an overall purse of $15,000. Digital Shadows said that the site administrators also announced that most \u201csuitable\u201d competition finalist would be given the ability to collaborate with the Sodinokibi team for everyone\u2019s mutual benefit.\u201c[Groups like Sodinokibi] have taken an interest in these competitions in order to foster technical skills among forum members, increase awareness of the availability of their malware (potentially increasing their sales) and gain valuable intelligence they could use for future malware development,\u201d according to the firm.Of course, the winnings in these underground contests are eclipsed by above-board hacking competitions \u2013 like the $25,000 per-exploit prizes given out at the recent Pwn2Own Miami. But Digital Shadows expects the trend of higher-stakes competitions to continue to grow and develop within underground channels.\u201cUsers on successful forums such as Exploit and XSS strongly identify as members of those sites and see the value in participating not only for their own benefit but also for the\u00a0 good of the forum,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cAfter all, helping the development of the forum is one of the major drivers behind organizing competitions: Cybercriminal forums need to attract and retain members in order to survive, and being able to present a site as a valuable repository of articles discussing pertinent cybercriminal issues is a real draw.\u201dBug BountyEditor's PicksHacksMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The very first Pwn2Own hacking competition that exclusively focuses on the industrial control systems (ICS) has kicked off in Miami. So far, a total of $180,000 has been awarded for pwning five different products.The contest hosts at Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day initiative (ZDI) have allocated more than $250,000 in cash and prizes for the contest, which is testing eight targets across five categories.So far, two teams are the big winners. The Horst Goertz for IT-Security team (Tobias Scharnowski, Niklas Breitfeld and Ali Abbasi) and the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski) both have $75,000 in winnings going into Day Three.On Day One, overall, there were six successful hacking attempts and two partially successful attempts against eight hacking targets, according to ZDI. On Day Two, there were three successful hacks and two partials against four total targets.Prizes and CategoriesThe categories include Control Servers, which covers server solutions that provide connectivity, monitoring and control across disparate programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and other field systems. The specific targets in this category include control servers from Iconics and Inductive Automation.OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Servers is another category, encompassing two targets: The Unified Automation ANSI C Demo Server and the OPC Foundation OPC UA .NET Standard. OPC UA serves as the universal translator protocol in the ICS world, used by almost all ICS products to send data between disparate vendor systems.The DNP3 Gateway category features the Triangle Microworks SCADA Data Gateway product as a target. DNP3 is a set of communications protocols used between various components in ICS systems, and is a primary protocol in the North American Electric Grid. \u201cIf the Data Gateway could be compromised, it could serve as a launching point for other attacks within the ICS, or even blind the energy management system (EMS),\u201d according to ZDI.Human Machine Interface (HMI)/Operator Workstation is the fourth category. \u00a0The HMI connects the operator of an ICS to the various hardware components of the ICS. Attackers that take over the HMI can also prevent the operator from seeing process issues in the ICS until it is too late.The HMI category consists of the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View SE product and the Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert. Rockwell Automation\u2019s HMI has a large deployed base in manufacturing and is seen in most other sectors as well. The Schneider Electric product is also found in multiple sectors.And finally, hackers are taking aim at Engineering Workstation Software (EWS), which directly communicates and can configure primary control equipment such as PLCs, and it can also configure role-based mechanisms.\u201cAttacks on the EWS were seen in the Stuxnet malware, and attackers are focusing on EWS given that it allows them to alter the process,\u201d ZDI explained.Day 1 HighlightsThe Horst Goertz for IT-Security team was the big winner of Day One. They used an out-of-bounds (OOB) access exploit to gain code execution against the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View SE in the HMI category, earning them $25,000. And later in the day, they earned an additional $25,000 for using an OOB Access bug to gain code execution on the Iconics Genesis64.The Flashback team won big as well, after gaining remote code execution with continuation against Iconics Genesis64 with a combination of two bugs. They were ultimately able to gain a system-level remote shell on the target server, earning $25,000.The Flashback team also successfully used an information leak and an unsafe deserialization bug to gain code execution on the Inductive Automation Ignition in the Control Server category, earning an additional $25,000.Besides these big hacks, Day One also saw success from the Claroty team. They used a deserialization bug to cause a denial of service (DoS) in the Iconics Genesis64 in the Control Server category, earning $5,000.The Incite Team of Steven Seeley and Chris Anastasio meanwhile used a stack-based overflow to cause a DoS on the Triangle Microworks SCADA Data Gateway, also earning them $5,000. The team also logged a partial success against the target, demonstrating remote code execution (RCE). However, the bug used had been previously reported, so no money was earned.And finally, Fabius Artrel had partial success against the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View SE, and achieved remote code execution with continuation against this target. However, this bug had also been previously reported and he ended the day with empty pockets.Day 2 HighlightsOn Day Two, the Incite Team saw a big win when they gained remote code execution at system level with continuation against the Inductive Automation Ignition in the Control Server category. They used an information leak along with a deserialization bug to achieve success, earning $25,000.The Flashback team added to their earnings on Day Two. They gained remote code execution with continuation against the Rockwell Automation Factory Talk View SE on Day Two using a multi-bug chain, also raking in $25,000.The Claroty team meanwhile used an arbitrary DLL loading bug along with a directory traversal bug to gain remote code execution on the Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Operator Terminal Expert in the HMI category, earning $20,000.The Horst Goertz for IT-Security team and the Claroty team both earned partial credit for successful remote code execution with continuation against the Inductive Automation Ignition; in both cases, they used bugs that had been previously reported.Ben McBride of Oak Ridge National Laboratory also saw partial credit, for achieving remote code execution with continuation against the Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk View SE; this bug too had been previously reported.\u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions for years about running a Pwn2Own for ICS, but there are many challenges to holding such a contest,\u201d contest organizers at said in a launch posting last October. \u201cTo overcome these issues, we worked with multiple people and companies within the ICS industry to ensure we have the right products and categories to create a meaningful test of the security of these products and protocols. As with our other contests, Pwn2Own Miami seeks to harden these platforms by revealing vulnerabilities and providing that research to the vendors. The goal is always to get these bugs fixed before they\u2019re actively exploited by attackers.\u201dBug BountyCritical InfrastructureHacks",

        "raw text": "Prosecutors in the Netherlands are asking for three years in prison for a Dutch politician who hacked into women\u2019s personal iCloud accounts and stole nude photos and other personal digital material belonging to them, then leaked some of it online.The public prosecutor of the North Holland Public Prosecution Service has requested that Mitchel van der K., a member of the VVD political party in the Netherlands, face three years in prison for hacking into personal accounts of \u201cwomen from his own environment, and of women he knew from the media,\u201d according to a translated version of the request, which was made public during the case\u2019s pre-sentencing process.Van der K was part of what the media dubbed \u201cThe Fappening,\u201d or \u201cCelebgate,\u201d in which the personal accounts of women, including some celebrities, were hacked and personal photos and other digital material\u2014most of it sexually provocative\u2013found on those accounts was publicly disseminated on social media.Van der K\u2019s victims in the Netherlands included Dutch YouTube star Laura Ponticorvo and Dutch field hockey star Fatima Moreira de Melo. Celebrities in the United States also were part of the global incident, in which personal, nude photos from the iCloud accounts of celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst were leaked online. In response, Dunst publicly criticized iCloud for the breach.In response to the hacks, Apple patched a vulnerability in its Find My iPhone app that likely was used by attackers in the breach.In addition to intimate or nude photos, Van der K also stole myriad other personal material that he found in his victim\u2019s accounts, including family photos, insurance documents and agendas, according to Dutch authorities. The extent of Van der K\u2019s hacking \u201cis unprecedented,\u201d they said.\u201cHe has invaded hundreds of accounts, frequently and repeatedly violating the privacy of the victims,\u201d according to the prosecution\u2019s sentencing request. \u201cIn their reports, the victims describe in a penetrating way what this invasion of their privacy has unleashed: \u2018It feels like someone broke into my house. It feels like a digital assault. I feel dirty and I feel watched. I also have a private life and I am very careful with that.'\u201dAuthorities believe Van der K began his involvement in the incident in 2015, but it wasn\u2019t discovered until 2017, when he leaked nude photos and sexually explicit material that he stole from Ponticorvo\u2019s account and she reported it to the police.When he was apprehended, Van der K had just been elected to the city council of the town in which he was living, Almere. He promptly resigned after his troubles with authorities began, according to a published report.Van der K has acknowledged that he frequently hacked or attempted to hack iCloud accounts, but said he was under pressure by an \u201cunknown extortioner\u201d or said that his own visual material would be leaked if he did not comply, according to Dutch authorities. The prosecutor in the case said he didn\u2019t buy Van der K\u2019s story, however.\u201cThe cases that the police have investigated in detail show that more than half of the accounts hacked by the suspect were women who had no (national) fame, but who did interact with him in his work or private environment,\u201d the prosecutor said in a statement. \u201cWhy an unknown extortioner would have forced suspects to browse their accounts for photos and videos, I don\u2019t understand at all.\u201dVan der K should know his sentencing fate just in time for Christmas, as the Dutch court is expected to rule on the case on Dec. 24, according to the prosecution.Free Threatpost Webinar: Risk around third-party vendors is real and can lead to data disasters.

The event will take place next year (Jan. 21 to Jan. 23) during the S4 Conference in Miami, according to the Zero Day Initiative, which organizes Pwn2Own.\u201cAs with our other contests, Pwn2Own Miami seeks to harden these platforms by revealing vulnerabilities and providing that research to the vendors,\u201d said Brian Gorenc, in a Monday post. \u201cThe goal is always to get these bugs fixed before they\u2019re actively exploited by attackers.\u201dPwn2Own Miami offers various prizes for vulnerabilities across five ICS categories, listed out below.Control server solutions, which provide connectivity, monitoring and control across disparate programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which monitor inputs and outputs and make logic-based decisions for automated systems.OPC Unified Architecture servers, essentially the \u201cuniversal translator protocol in the ICS world,\u201d which integrates the functionality behind various OPC Classic specifications into one extensible framework.DNP3, a set of communications protocols used between various components in ICS systems (the primary protocol in the North American Electric Grid).Human machine interface (HMI)/operator workstations, which connect machine operator to the various hardware components of the industrial control systems.Engineering workstation software, which directly communicates and can configure primary control equipment such as PLCs, and also configures role-based mechanisms.Hackers will have an opportunity to focus on specific equipment to find various vulnerabilities \u2013 including unauthenticated crash or denial-of-service flaws, information disclosure glitches and remote code-execution vulnerabilities.Pwn2Own prizes for control server flaws.Remote code-execution flaws will have the highest payouts, with prizes of up to $20,000 for finding them in products like the Iconics Genesis64 (a control server) or the Triangle Microworks SCADA data gateway (a DNP3 gateway), for example.The new focus on ICS may come as no surprise given the continual disclosure of security bugs in the manufacturing, power and water plants, the oil and gas industries \u2013 such as recent flaws found in the Delta enteliBUS Manager and the\u00a0Rockwell Automation industrial drive.In fact, a recent Kaspersky report found that a full 41.2 percent of industrial control systems were attacked by malicious software at least once in the first half of 2018.\u201cAs the worlds of IT and OT [operational technology] continue to converge, the threats facing critical infrastructure will only increase,\u201d Eitan Goldstein, senior director of strategic initiatives at Tenable told Threatpost. \u201cThe expansion of ICS into hacking competitions is a worthwhile initiative. It shows a growing awareness of the exposure gap around ICS and the increasing importance of extending proven security practices into OT environments. It\u2019s also great to see that ICS vendors are willing to engage with the security community on this type of research. It\u2019s important that researchers and vendors continue to work together to secure the systems we all rely on.\u201dGorenc said that interested hackers can contact ZDI (via email at zdi@trendmicro.com) to begin the event registration process for the event.What are the top mistakes leading to data breaches at modern enterprises?

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 The Tencent Blade Team of researchers demonstrated several ways they have developed to hack and run remote code on Google Home smart speakers. The hacks center around what is known as a Magellan vulnerability, which can be used to exploit the massively popular SQLite database engine.Here at a session at DEF CON on Thursday, the researchers shed light on their work \u201cbreaking\u201d Google Home. What made the talk unique wasn\u2019t necessarily that Google Home smart speakers could be compromised using Megellan \u2013 that was public news in Dec. 2018 \u2013 rather it was how the hack was pulled off.On stage Tencent researchers Wenxiang Qian, YuXiang Li and HuiYu Wu laid out the evolution of their research.\nThe hack of Google Home first focused on hardware, similar to the researchers approach when compromising Amazon Echo, made public last year at DEF CON. In the Echo case, researchers tampered with the flash hardware chips to create the attack scenario. In the case of Google Home, it was a bit trickier because researchers couldn\u2019t find a hardware interface for debugging and flashing \u2013 as they did with the Amazon Echo hack.So in this instance, researchers found clues to pull off their hack by extracting the Google Home firmware, through dumping it from the device\u2019s NAND flash.Because of secure boot and other OTA security verification mechanisms, researchers said directly tampering with firmware was out of the question.\u201cWe designed a new adapter to export the pins of the test socket to a larger pitch. So, we can easily connect the chip to the programmer. Finally, it is used to read the firmware through the programmer,\u201d researchers said.From there they looked for weaknesses to exploit. One such method included an easy way to simulate an upgrade request (TLS). Researchers also identified a potential road to a Google Home compromise via the CAST protocol, used by Google Home to cast multimedia content from one smart device to another.\u201cWe exploited the Magellan vulnerability to compromise cast_shell (the main program of Google Home). Through cast protocol, we can trigger Google Home to visit malicious web pages to exploit the Magellan vulnerability to exploit cast_shell,\u201d researchers told Threatpost.Magellan, a set of three heap buffer overflow and heap data disclosure vulnerabilities in SQLite (CVE-2018-20346, CVE-2018-20505 CVE-2018-20506), affects a large number of browsers, IoT devices and smartphones that use the open source Chromium engine. As applied to Google Home, it can lead to remote code execution via weaknesses in Chrome renderer \u2013 a la the known Magellan attack technique exploiting the SQLite flaw.The researchers also expanded the attack surface of Google Home to include one based on a malicious app. In this example, an attacker posts a malicious Cast app to an app store. Now an attacker can remotely trigger Google Home to load the malicious app in the LAN. Next, Google Home is forced to visit a malicious URL via an embedded Chrome browser- triggering the Magellan attack.The good news is, according researchers, there are no indications that Magellan has been abused in the wild.\u201cWe have reported all the details of the vulnerability to Google and they have fixed the vulnerability. If your product uses Chromium, please update to the official stable version 71.0.3578.80 (or above). If your product uses SQLite, please update to 3.26.0 (or latest release).\u201dBlack Hat USA 2019 has kicked off this week in Las Vegas.

        "raw text": "The Department of Homeland Security issued an alert Tuesday warning that small aircraft are vulnerable to hackers that can gain physical access to a plane. It warned that a hacker can easily manipulate aircraft telemetry data, which can result in loss of control of the airplane.The bulletin was issued after researchers at Rapid 7 released a lengthy report on the ease with which a malicious actor can gain access to an aircraft\u2019s Controller Area Network (CAN) bus and hack it. A CAN bus is a piece of hardware used by automobiles and small aircraft that allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications, in the absence of a host computer.In its security alert, the DHS\u2019 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency drew from the Rapid 7 report, stating, \u201cAn attacker with physical access to the aircraft could attach a device to an avionics CAN bus that could be used to inject false data, resulting in incorrect readings in avionic equipment.\u201dCAN bus hacking is behind multiple hacks of cars \u2014 including researchers Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller\u2019s famous hack of a Jeep in 2014. Since then, automobile CAN buses have been compromised to take control over a number of cars, including those made by Tesla and Volkswagen.When it comes to small aircraft, Patrick Kiley, senior security consultant and penetration tester with Rapid 7 and the author of the report, points out that \u201cmodern aircraft systems are becoming increasingly reliant on networked communications systems to display information to the pilot as well as control various systems aboard aircraft.\u201dThat includes no direct mechanical linkage between a pilot\u2019s controls; such as wing flaps, trim, the engine and the autopilot system. \u201cThis is similar to how most modern automobiles no longer have a physical connection between the throttle and the actuator that causes the engine to accelerate,\u201d he wrote.As part of its investigation, Rapid 7 looked at two commercially available avionic systems and successfully sent false data to both, feeding the pilot bogus engine telemetry readings, incorrect compass and altitude readings (formerly known as the gyro horizon), fake airspeed and critical angle of attack data. Researchers did not reveal the names of the avionics vendors.\u201cSuch an attacker could attach a device\u2014or co-opt an existing attached device\u2014to an avionics CAN bus in order to inject false measurements and communicate them to the pilot,\u201d Kiley wrote. He also emphasized that physical access to the airplane is a prerequisite for the hack.Hack Details and Mitigation SuggestionsThe research involved using a USB2CAN device connected to the targeted CAN bus. Next, using the Linux operating system running CAN-utils, researchers were able to see the avionics instructions.\u201cThe system was reverse-engineered by sending individual recorded CAN packets back onto the avionics bus and observing what effects they had with the various nodes,\u201d according to the researcher. \u201cThis reversing technique is particularly effective in CAN bus explorations compared to other networking environments, since CAN bus implementations are often susceptible to replay attacks.\u201dThrough a series of replay messages along with crafted messages, Rapid7 was able to generate incorrect attitude, headings data, airspeed and much more.\u201cAn attack against the autopilot and attitude indicator could lead to an unusual attitude\u00a0and potentially loss of control of the aircraft, given that forged CAN bus messages can create disastrous scenarios very quickly,\u201d researchers wrote.To prevent this type of hacking, Rapid7 is suggesting the aeronautics industry steal a page from automakers. In automotive networking, there have been significant efforts to mitigate against malicious CAN bus networking, researchers said. Some of those mitigation efforts have included CAN bus-specific filtering, whitelisting and firewalls.\u201c[Those automobile efforts] do not appear to have gotten much traction in avionics networking, at least in the avionics systems favored by pilots of small aircraft,\u201d Kiley wrote. He recommended that a message authentication protocol for the \u201copen ended nature of CAN bus\u201d would strengthen defenses. He also suggested an increase, from eight bytes to 64, when it comes to Flexible Data-Rates (CAN FD), which dictate the speed and the amount of data processed by the avionics CAN.\u201cSome of that extra space can now be used for security-critical features such as replay protection and cryptographic hashing,\u201d he wrote.Rapid7 plans to discuss its findings further next week at Aviation Village at DEF CON 27, taking place Aug. 8 through 11. Be sure to follow all DEF CON 27 and Black Hat coverage right here at Threatpost starting next week.\u00a0GovernmentHacksVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Like an unstoppable incoming tide, connectivity has quietly inundated the automobiles we so love to drive.In less than a decade, amazing driver-assist mechanisms and must-have infotainment systems have swept into the dashboards of many popular car models for sale today. And we\u2019re just at the start of this trend. Connectivity, apps, smartphone integration and autonomous driving are on an upward sweep taking us toward widespread public use of driverless vehicles, just a few years away.As these developments unfold, the auto and tech industries \u2013 as well as state and federal regulators \u2013 are scrambling to fully understand and address newfound safety and privacy concerns. \u201cThe threats to the connected cars of today, and to the autonomous cars of the future, include not only the vehicles, but also the ecosystem they operate in,\u201d said Stacy Janes, chief security architect of the connected transport division of Irdeto, a supplier of software anti-piracy systems.Going forward, connected cars will increasingly make life-or-death decisions about physical objects and other digital systems they can sense nearby, while at the same time collecting and storing troves of monetizable operational and personal data.\u201cThe high-level challenge is, how do you get all of these systems traveling at high speed to work safely together,\u201d said Bryson Bort, chief executive officer of Scythe, an Arlington, Virginia\u2013based supplier of pen testing tools. \u201cThe hidden risk is that a system doesn\u2019t need to be directly compromised to affect its decision-making. It\u2019s possible to influence the data the vehicle is collecting.\u201dAs the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. In the context of data continuity and smart cars, it is the passengers\u2019 safety on the line.The core security and privacy challenges are daunting. A viable level of trust must be established between multiple connected systems intensively collecting a tsunami of sensitive data. Interestingly, it is the same threshold of trust that must be met to bring the budding Internet of Things economy to full fruition.Redoubled InnovationRemember when wrenching on a hot rod was a pastime accessible to the average teenager? No longer. Modern cars rely on a growing bank of computing devices called electronic control units, or ECUs, linked together to control braking, acceleration, steering, engine performance, door locks, climate control, navigation and infotainment.In 2003, a model of the Toyota Prius came along that featured automatic parallel parking assistance. It took Ford and BMW six years to come up with something similar. And then the pace of innovation shifted into high gear. Today, parking-assist, lane-guidance and collision-avoidance systems are commonplace.2019 Audi A8l Interior DashboardCar models are rising steadily up the Society of Automotive Engineers\u2019 zero-to-five scale of vehicle autonomy. Most cars today are at level 0 \u2013 equipped with automated systems that can send warnings and temporarily intervene but cannot control the vehicle on their own. But more and more models are being delivered at level 2, where automated systems can sometimes take over steering, accelerating and braking, though the driver must stay ready to intervene.The 2019 Audi A8 has reached level 3, at which the driver can divert his or her attention to a non-driving task under certain circumstances; for example, when snaking through a highway jam. The A8 comes equipped with 24 video, radar, sonic and laser sensors that work together to steer the car autonomously, at low speeds, on roadways with physical barriers separating the oncoming traffic.Level 5 vehicles \u2013 in which human driving is completely eliminated \u2013 may arrive as soon as 2020. In the meantime, computer-assisted controls are becoming more pervasive even as infotainment systems are being continually upgraded. As the connectedness of cars deepens, the line between autonomous driving systems and in-car infotainment services is rapidly blurring, and we see all-too-familiar trade-offs \u2013 security and privacy versus functionality and convenience \u2013 being made, industry experts told Threatpost.\u201cAs the number of systems increases without significant evolution of the underlying architecture, vulnerabilities can be expected to grow exponentially,\u201d said Rusty Carter, vice president of product management at Arxan Technologies, a San Francisco\u2013based supplier of application security systems that\u2019s working closely with the auto industry.Safety First and ForemostIt has been more than three years since researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek remotely hacked their Jeep Cherokee as an experiment. Using a laptop and sitting 10 miles distant, the duo took control of the digital display screen, engaged the brakes, cut the transmission and killed the engine.Since the Jeep hack, there have been a number of instances of hackers overcoming the electronic door locks of parked cars. But hacks of moving vehicles has mainly been done by researchers in controlled settings. Meanwhile, a cottage industry of startups and established tech security vendors has cropped up to focus on securing the expanding ECU platforms governing modern vehicles. These include Irdeto, Arxan, Scythe and Thinci, an El Dorado Hills, California\u2013based startup developing next-generation vehicle control platforms.Thinci president Dinakar Munagala anticipates that connected vehicles will increasingly tap into over-the-air maintenance updates, as well as relay information about road infrastructure and nearby vehicles to after-market service providers. Munagala said the auto and tech industries realize they must achieve certain benchmarks of security and privacy to fully monetize this wellspring of operational and personal data, collected in real time.\u201cAs software complexity rises, the attack surface extends beyond the vehicle,\u201d Munagala said. \u201cUse of autonomous systems can dramatically increase the consequences of any attack, so security has to extend beyond just protecting the vehicle.\u201dSafety is paramount, of course, and it comes down to whether any electronic component can fail on its own \u2013 or at the behest of a malicious hacker \u2013 in a potentially catastrophic way. Given the rising complexity of connected systems, the solution won\u2019t be as straightforward as, say, mandating seat belts or airbags.\u201cFunctional safety and overall security cannot be addressed by the addition of one or two components to the system,\u201d Munagala told Threatpost. \u201cIt must be considered, analyzed and implemented throughout the development process with a systems-engineering approach.\u201dPrivacy MattersAuthorities responsible for public safety are cognizant of these budding concerns.Initial discussions about specific safety rules have commenced within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal Trade Commission. Law enforcement is paying close attention, too. Two cases were recently argued before the U.S. Supreme Court probing the definition of vehicle privacy, when it comes to unreasonable searches and seizures. More such cases are sure to come.Meanwhile, 17 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have enacted statutes limiting the use of information collected by event-data recorders, or EDRs, the \u201cblack boxes\u201d installed on all vehicles since 2013 that capture operational data at the time of a crash. Between the auto and tech industries embracing self-regulation, and state lawmakers defending consumers\u2019 interest, a mix of engineering breakthroughs and government requirements is likely to take shape, said Elizabeth Rogers, a privacy and data security partner at Michael Best and Friedrich.\u201cA variety of data is necessary to engineer this technology, and there will also be a variety of sensitivities to the types of data collected,\u201d Rogers elaborates. \u201cVarying levels of consent should be incorporated into the design, with express consent being required before sharing a consumer\u2019s unique and individualized driver data.\u201dAlthough engineering prowess can be expected to ultimately make connected cars as safe as they need to be, resolving mushrooming privacy concerns will be much more problematic. The lure of monetizing machine and human data sets gushing from connected vehicles is already driving some stakeholders to behave in ways likely to stir Congressional intervention.USA Today, for example, disclosed that rental-car companies routinely fail to delete personally identifiable information that renters type into infotainment systems. And CBS News recently reported that carmakers have experimented with reselling blocks of location data to mapping vendors, stoking privacy advocates\u2019 concerns about third parties moving to auction information collected from onboard cameras and sensors to the highest bidders.Already, the move by 17 states to restrict use of EDR-collected data is reinforcing criticism about the insurance industry leveraging data collected by connected vehicles in ways that might be unfair to individual citizens. Arsan\u2019s Carter observes: \u201cCollection, storage, usage and third-party party access to information about the vehicle\u2019s operation and performance will pose privacy concerns rivaling those of any social network or financial account usage.\u201dFeaturedPrivacyVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "LEIPZIG, GERMANY \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest hacker conference kicked off Thursday marking the 35th Chaos Communication Congress. The confab is a four-day, 24/7 celebration of everything hacker \u2013 from the latest threats to cyber-inspired art installations and discussions on how technology impacts ethics, society and politics.The conference, created by a Hamburg collective known as the Chaos Computer Club, fills the massive Congress Center in Leipzig. Under the impressive glass and steel dome are legions of hackers, makers and cyber-driven professionals sitting in on talks ranging on the traditional \u201chardware implants in supply chains\u201d fare to out-there session titled \u201cTranshuman Expression\u201c.Unique to the conference is a massive exhibition hall full of 35th Chaos Communication Congress (35C3) Assemblies.\u00a0 Assemblies are a diverse set of maker, hacker and social minded groups from Europe and beyond. Each Assembly is unique and typically consists of a defined area of tables, couches and exhibits in the hall and offer hardware, tools such as soldering irons and human inspiration for anyone to hack, tinker and create things. One Assembly provided circuit boards, soldering irons and programmable LED lights, and another a pile of ready-to-hack vintage video game hardware.On the installation front, artist Elias Mache let loose a programmable hybrid robot-dog spider thing (complete with a gas mask) on display. Attendees were invited to custom code robot movements. Another installation featured a bike inner tube, the top half of a plastic bottle hooked up to a circuit board and an air compressor. The result (see video at bottom) gave off an odd-sounding groans.Spectators wander the dim-light caverns of the hall of Assemblies \u2013 many drinking the extremely popular and highly-caffeinated Mate Floral Power soft drinks. In the distance the soft sound of pulsing tech-inspired music can be heard from a live DJ.From a tree-themed platform overlooking an Assembly hall, the floor is dotted with geodesic domes and a few converted shipping containers. Perched in the tree, a conference attendee, a Linux consultant, explains that the conference encourages a type of collaborative anarchy where ideas mesh with others and create something new.Noticeably absent are the big tech names sponsoring booths that you might expect to find at a conference this size. Instead, an Assembly called \u201cBinary Kitchen\u201d is running a coding contest to inspire attendees to help create an open-source telemedicine platform. The group\u2019s goal is to help give affordable healthcare access to impoverished communities around the world \u2014 without having to pay the $40,000 or so that a telemedicine installation would usually cost.On the conference side of 35C3 are an impressive lineup of speakers from security researchers from groups such as Check Point, privacy advocates including representatives from Privacy International and computer science PhD candidates.Noticeably present at this show is a kid-friendly atmosphere. It\u2019s clear the conference is trying to make 35C3 appeal to the next-generation of hackers. There are a number of maker tables and kid-friendly zones designed to allow children to play and be hacker-inspired.Stick with Threatpost in the days ahead to follow our 35C3 coverage.FeaturedMobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Midterm elections are being held across the country Tuesday which means millions will be paying close attention to wins and losses. But, for cybersecurity experts, such as Tom Kellermann, the focus will be on voting irregularities.Tom KellermannKellermann is chief cybersecurity officer for Carbon Black and for months leading up to Tuesday\u2019s vote his team has been analyzing election security. In a recent report that looks at cyberattacks leading up to the 2018 midterm election, Carbon Black found that two-thirds of incident response professionals surveyed believe hacking will influence the upcoming U.S. elections.Threatpost caught up with Kellermann \u00a0on the eve of the 2018 midterms to discuss the study and better understand his biggest worries.Threatpost: How concerned should voters be when it comes to trusting the integrity of the entire voting process and U.S. voting infrastructure?Kellermann: They should very concerned for a number of specific reasons. Number one is the integrity of voter records and voter rolls. Our researchers found 20 separate state voter databases available for purchase on the Dark Web, representing 81 million voters. Some from swing states. The biggest concern relative to those records being exposed is not just the identity theft that will or will not occur, but it\u2019s the nature in which someone can tamper with the integrity of the voting records.Threatpost: How so?Kellermann: The problem is if someone shows up at the polls to vote and they are denied the capacity to vote because someone has skewed the integrity of that voter roll data. Voter databases include full names, current and previous addresses, gender and phone numbers. By virtue that many of these databases ended up on the Dark Web there is a chance hackers had access to the source data and may have compromised the integrity of that data.Threatpost: How might a hacker manipulate the data?Kellermann: In our latest incident response report we report over 81.5 million American voter details for sale to other hackers, criminals and/ or nation states. My biggest concern with the availability of voter records is the construct that selectively foreign hackers could attempt to suppress the vote of American citizens by changing the integrity of their addresses and/ or spellings of their names in these databases.Threatpost: How widespread is this problem?Kellermann: I\u2019m not suggesting that there\u2019s going to be widespread tampering with the integrity of the data. That said, voter data is rich with PII. Targeting of messages could be very specific.Threatpost: Can you talk about that some more?\u00a0Your report discusses how hackers are advertising on the Dark Web \u201claser focused\u201d ads on social media to hyper-target campaigns to \u201cmanipulate\u201d public opinion.Kellermann:\u00a0 This is a secondary concern of mine on Tuesday. Whether it be foreign or domestic, there will be information influence operations to control individual voters in swing states and the mainstream media to convince the American public that certain races have already been decided, in hopes of eliminating the impetus and excitement of a voter to go out to the polls.One of the more elegant attacks that we have seen in the past was an attack on a major media outlet covering Wall Street. Hackers created a disinformation campaign targeting a media outlet that a company\u2019s stocks were plummeting. As a result of that media attack, people began to sell off the stocks. I\u2019m seeing the same phenomenon in politics.Politics, consumer confidence and investor confidence are all driven by a similar herd mentality. How much does it take to create a stampede? Hopefully less as we all get wiser to acts of manipulation.Threatpost: Besides not falling for it, how do we combat the disinformation noise?Kellermann: Vote. If the majority of Americans go out there and exercise their right to vote it reduces statistical ambiguity.I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s going to be hackers on both sides of the American spectrum who will leverage their skillsets to attempt to manipulate the election in some fashion. But at the end of the day, the more voting that occurs the harder it will be to skew the results. If millions upon millions of Americans actually get off their couches and vote, we will have a larger and truer representation of the people\u2019s will and a greater statistical significance of what should be occurring politically in the US.BreachCritical InfrastructureEditor's PicksGovernmentHacksNewsmaker InterviewsPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Up to 35 million voter records have been found up for sale on a popular hacking forum from 19 states, researchers discovered.Researchers at Anomali Labs and Intel 471 on Monday said that they discovered Dark Web communications offering a large quantity of voter databases for sale \u2013 including valuable personally identifiable information and voter history.This represents the first indication of 2018 voter registration data for sale on a hacking forum, said the researchers. The discovery comes weeks before the U.S. November mid-term elections.\u201cWith the November 2018 midterm elections only four weeks away, the availability and currency of the voter records, if combined with other breached data, could be used by malicious actors to disrupt the electoral process or pursue large-scale identity theft,\u201dresearchers at Anomali Labs said in a Monday post. \u201cGiven the illicit vendor claims of weekly updates of voter records and their high reputation on the hacker forum, we assess with moderate confidence that he or she may have persistent database access and/or contact with government officials from each state.\u201dResearchers did not post what the name of the hacking forum was, or the timeline of the sales.The disclosure affects 19 states and includes 23 million records for just three of the 19 states, researchers said. Impacted states include: Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.No record counts were provided for the remaining 16 states, but they did include prices for each state. Each voter list ranges from $150 to $12,500, depending on the state, the research team said. These prices could be related to the number of voter records per database.The records contain voter data including full name, phone numbers, physical addresses, voting history, and other unspecified voting data.\u201cWe estimate that the entire contents of the disclosure could exceed 35 million records,\u201d the research team said. \u201cResearchers have reviewed a sample of the database records and determined the data to be valid with a high degree of confidence.\u201dResearchers said that within hours of the initial\u00a0 advertisement, a \u201chigh-profile actor\u201d organized a crowdfunding campaign to purchase each of the voter registration databases.\u201cAccording to the actor, the purchased databases would be made available free of charge to all registered members of the hacker forum, with early access given to donors of the project,\u201d said researchers.So far, of the 19 available databases, Kansas has been acquired and published as part of that crowdfunding campaign \u2013 and Oregon is in the lead as the second state to be published.Concerns around voter data in the U.S. have continued to peak as the elections draw near.In July, a misconfigured repository bucket was found leaking the information of U.S. voters. The information was exposed on a public Amazon S3 bucket by a Virginia-based political campaign and robocalling company called Robocent.While voter lists are not permitted to be used for commercial purposes, \u201cState voter registration lists can be obtained at varying costs established by each state,\u201d researchers said. Those lists could include registered voters and who has voted in specific elections \u2013 but, rules still remain governing which authorized persons (such as political campaigns, journalists or academic researchers) may retrieve and use the data.\u201cThis type of information can facilitate criminal actions such as identity fraud or allow for false submissions of changes online to voter registrations, making some legitimate voters ineligible to cast ballots,\u201d researchers said. \u201cIn a voter identity theft scenario, fraudsters can cause disruptions to the electoral process through physical address changes, deletion of voter registrations or requests for absentee ballots on behalf of the legitimate voter.\u201dCritical InfrastructureEditor's PicksGovernmentHacksPrivacy",

        "raw text": "The Justice Department has charged a North Korean man in the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) in 2014 \u2013 as well as the global WannaCry attack last year that caused millions of dollars of economic damage and also charged him with the costly 2016 SWIFT attack on the Bangladesh central bank.The DoJ said in its 179-page complaint that the suspect, Park Jin-hyok, was involved in \u201ca conspiracy to conduct multiple destructive cyberattacks around the world\u201d as a member of the Lazarus Group, a well-known APT actor. Though researchers have suspected the APT to be an extension of the North Korean government for many years \u2013 it first appeared in 2010 \u2013 this is the first time the U.S. government has fully weighed in on attribution.The complaint alleges that the North Korean government, through the instrument of the Lazarus Group, robbed the Bangladeshi central bank of $81 million; hacked SPE in retaliation for the film The Interview, which featured a parody of DPRK leader Kim Jon-Un (the DoJ said the move was \u201cagainst free speech in order to chill it half a world away\u201d; and authored the WannaCry ransomware that impacted victims in more than 150 countries, including Britain\u2019s National Health Service, shipping giant Maersk, Boeing, Telefonica and many others.The complaint also alleges that in 2016 and 2017, this conspiracy targeted a number of U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, with spear-phishing emails with intent to steal nation-state secrets.\u201cThe scale and scope of the cyber-crimes alleged by the complaint is staggering and offensive to all who respect the rule of law and the cyber-norms accepted by responsible nations,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Demers, in the DoJ\u2019s announcement. \u201cThe investigation, prosecution and other disruption of malicious state-sponsored cyber activity remains among the highest priorities of the National Security Division and I thank the FBI agents, DOJ prosecutors, and international partners who have put years of effort into this investigation.\u201dFor his part, Park is suspected of working for North Korea\u2019s equivalent of the CIA, known as the Reconnaissance General Bureau. He was charged with computer fraud and wire fraud, which carry five-year and 20-year maximum sentences, respectively. Park is not however likely to see a jail cell: the U.S. , as one might expect, has no extradition treaties with North Korea.Also Thursday, the Treasury Department announced that it has added Park\u2019s name to its sanctions list, along with a company he\u2019s known to be affiliated with (Chosun Expo Joint Venture, or K.E.J.V.) This prevents Park or K.E.J.V. from doing business with any bank or financial institution based in the U.S.\u201cWe will not allow North Korea to undermine global cybersecurity to advance its interests and generate illicit revenues in violation of our sanctions,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.A Litany of WoesThe activities are some of the largest cyber-stories of the last few years, and taken together make up a complex web of economic sabotage.About 437,000 people were affected by the 2014 hack on SPE, which saw the attackers break into company computers and release thousands of emails, documents and sensitive personal information to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks went on to release about 170,000 emails, including mails containing racially tinged comments from studio head Amy Pascal\u2014who stepped down in the aftermath\u2014and producer Scott Rudin.It also spilled Hollywood dirt; Rudin also called Angelina Jolie a \u201cminimally talented spoiled brat\u201d in an email as the two discussed an upcoming Cleopatra project. \u201cShe\u2019s studying films\u201d he said. \u201cKill me now.\u201dSony in 2015 said that the cost for dealing with the breach totaled $15 million for the quarter in which it occurred, which it reported in February of that year.Meanwhile, in 2016 the attackers exploited a poorly configured network switch at the Bangladeshi central bank, which left its firewall unguarded and opened the door to hackers stealing credentials allowing them to make payment transfers. They then set about stealing $81 million via the SWIFT payment platform via a series of transfer requests with the New York Federal Reserve Bank over the course of a weekend in early February of that year.There were three dozen requests. The New York Fed processed four of them, shifting money into accounts in the Philippines. The heist would have totaled $1 billion or more if a spelling mistake in the routing instructions hadn\u2019t raised the alarm. Other SWIFT attacks have followed this event, which kicked off a brand-new attack type for the cybercrime world.Then there was WannaCry. The ransomware become a global news sensation as scores of major companies fell victim to it; the first reports involved Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica, but it soon became clear that the attack affected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.WannaCry demanded a ransom of $300 in Bitcoin, which doubled if not paid within three days. It spread using the \u201cEternalBlue\u201d exploit published by the ShadowBrokers threat group as part of their trove of stolen NSA hacking tools. While the global viral infection was killed thanks to a hard-coded kill switch in the malware, variants of WannaCry remain a ransomware scourge to this day.As for the defense contractor spear-phishing attacks, which haven\u2019t been very well publicized, the DoJ explained:These malicious emails used some of the same aliases and accounts seen in the SPE attack, at times accessed from North Korean IP addresses, and contained malware with the same distinct data table found in the malware used against SPE and certain banks, the complaint alleges. The spear-phishing emails sent to the defense contractors were often sent from email accounts that purported to be from recruiters at competing defense contractors, and some of the malicious messages made reference to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system deployed in South Korea. The attempts to infiltrate the computer systems of Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for the THAAD missile system, were not successful.In all, the official linking of the Lazarus Group to North Korea and all of these activities is significant and the real point of the DoJ making the charges against Park \u2013 as it paints a wide-ranging conspiracy behind a latticework of massively damaging attacks.\u201cWe stand with our partners to name the North Korean government as the force behind this destructive global cyber campaign,\u201d said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \u201cThis group\u2019s actions are particularly egregious as they targeted public and private industries worldwide \u2013 stealing millions of dollars, threatening to suppress free speech, and crippling hospital systems. We\u2019ll continue to identify and illuminate those responsible for malicious cyberattacks and intrusions, no matter who or where they are.\u201dBreachGovernmentHacksMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 In recent years there has been more attention paid to the security of medical devices; however, there has been little security research done on the unique protocols used by these devices. Many of the insulin pumps, heart monitors and other gadgets found in hospital rooms use aging protocol to communicate with nurses\u2019 stations and doctors; and as such, can be easily subverted.Case in point is the RWHAT protocol, one of the networking protocols used by medical devices to monitor a patient\u2019s condition and vital signs. Doug McKee, senior security researcher at McAfee\u2019s Advanced Threat Research team, has discovered a weakness that allows data on the patient\u2019s condition to be modified by an attacker in real-time, to provide false information to medical personnel.The ramifications are profound; false information could lead a doctor to prescribe medication that the patient doesn\u2019t need; or, a patient could be thought to be peacefully resting, when in fact they are under cardiac arrest.Further, McKee found that a lack of authentication also allows rogue devices to be placed onto the network and mimic patient monitors.Uncovering a VulnerabilityMedical personnel take advantage of information on heart rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen levels and more to make decisions on patient treatment and other critical care options, fed to central monitoring stations from various devices on the network using uncommon networking protocols.To examine how secure these systems are, McKee bought a heart monitor off of eBay and spent a couple months fully reverse-engineering RWHAT (the language is so esoteric that he was unable to find any information, let along technical documents, online).In his research, presented today at DEF CON 2018, he found that RWHAT uses no authentication and no encryption for the data it sends; which, in addition to the vital signs information, also includes some sensitive, HIPAA-regulated patient information, such as name, date of birth, the patient\u2019s bed number and the room number.Thanks to the gates being wide open, McKee was able to inject information into the protocol to spoof/emulate vital information using a very simple means.\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to do \u2013 you just plug in small Raspberry Pi device into a port and you can trick the nurse\u2019s station monitor into thinking it\u2019s communicating with something other than what it is,\u201d McKee explained in an interview. \u201cYou\u2019re then in control, and you can modify some of the data in transit in real time.\u201dThe attack could also become a remote attack, if a threat actor were able to take advantage of vulnerabilities in the hospital network.In the demo, McKee showed how he was able to change a patient\u2019s heart-rate data feed from an 80 to flatline and back to a 120, controlling it at will from a computer.Exploitation ScenariosThe potential exploitation scenarios are varied.In a less likely situation, an attacker can make use of the fact that nursing staff are very rarely in a patient\u2019s room outside of scheduled rounds, unless there\u2019s an alarm. Thus, an attacker bent on physical mayhem can use that to his or her advantage by sending \u201cnormal\u201d vital signs to the nurse\u2019s station, even as he or she poisons or otherwise harms the patient.In a more likely situation, an attacker could connect to the hospital network and emulate data over a period of time in an effort to manipulate medical personnel.\u201cIt\u2019s possible to make small, believable changes very quickly,\u201d McKee explained. \u201cSay a patient is resting, and the heart-rate jumps to 180 for a couple of seconds; that triggers an alert that\u2019s sent to a database log. Nurses are trained to see and pick up on any intermittent change of heart-rate. If it happens once, it may be chalked up to a glitch. But if it were to happen say three or four times over a longer period, say four hours, the nurse would then page a doctor, who will review the log and decide what action to take.\u201dSteve Povolny, head of advanced threat research at McAfee, explained that the protocol is that if there are intermittent heart changes, medication is required.\u201cAnytime you\u2019re given meds you don\u2019t need, that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cAnd this is a very realistic and dangerous scenario; it\u2019s very trivial to cause reactions in medical personnel to make them make treatment decisions that they wouldn\u2019t make otherwise.\u201dAt the very least, it would trigger additional testing, which runs up hospital bills for the patient and leads to more hospital resource consumption.Scope of the Threat The best defense for a hospital is to ensure that its networks are properly set up and isolated, and that devices are patched and that default passwords are changed \u2013 this prevents remote access. However, many environments are rife with holes that an enterprising malefactor could easily take advantage of.\u201cI\u2019ve seen situations where it\u2019s possible to pivot into hospital networks using the public WiFi from the parking lot,\u201d Povolny said. \u201cOr, video game consoles set up for kids at the hospital are usually plugged into the network \u2013 and using the touchscreen, you can bring up the admin panel. It takes all of 30 seconds to find the default PIN using a Google search.\u201dEven with the right mitigations in place to prevent such non-standard pivot points, bad actors can carry out an attack fairly easily.\u201cAt that point, carrying out an attack would require physical access to a network port, or an in-room attack,\u201d Povolny said. \u201cThe reality is that these are public places; it\u2019s not hard to walk into a hospital lobby and walk around. You\u2019ll see workstations on wheels \u2013 that\u2019s a good vector. The amount of code and effort needed to accomplish this is extremely minimal \u2013 you just walk by, plug in a USB, download code and walk away. For a determined attacker, it\u2019s not that hard to pull off.\u201dBlack HatCritical InfrastructureVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS -Like many good hacks, necessity was the mother of invention for researcher Guillaume Valadon.When the head of the network security laboratory at ANSSI tried turn a cheap non-wired digital photo frame lying around his house into a wireless one with a Toshiba FlashAir SD storage card little did he know he was embarking on a three year adventure.\u201cIt became something I did in my spare time. Something I continued in an effort to teach myself how to reverse engineer hardware,\u201d he said. Fast forward, and Valadon had saved himself the cost of a wireless digital picture frame (about $30) and created his own.At a Black Hat session here on Wednesday, Valadon demonstrated how he hacked the Toshiba FlashAir SD storage card and was able to execute code on the card. The challenge, he pointed out, was that the card was a virtual black box. He had nothing to go by \u2013 from the unidentified OS running on the card, the mystery firmware and a custom unidentified Toshiba chipset.The Toshiba FlashAir card hacked by Valadon was a 2015 model W-03 version running firmware V.01 that is still widely available today for around $25. Toshiba has since launched a W-04 model in 2017, which was not involved in this project.\u201cFirst, I needed a binary to analyze, then I needed to find the CPU architecture, the operating system and finally an execution vector,\u201d he said. The execution vector, or payload, could be anything from a buffer overflow to an undocumented command such as \u201cprint a calc.\u201dTo accomplish his unraveling of the card, Valadon said he used only about eight open-source tools and toolsets such as Sibyl, flasher and R2Scapy, a python-based interactive packet manipulation program.After cracking open the card and visually examining the components he began to painstakingly scour publicly available documentation on components and use tools to comb through error strings generated by the OS.\u201cA lot of error strings have the same format. This one got my attention: it is three letters, underscore, three letters, an error code, and a function name. \u2018wup_tsk\u2019 looked like a promising clue,\u201d he said.Searching the internet for \u201cwup_tsk\u201d led to site on a task synchronization function. \u201cIt says that wup_tsk is used to wake up a task in a system operation named T-Kernel,\u201d he said. \u201cT-Kernel is part of the TRON family \u2013 the real-time operating system Nucleus.\u201dUsing similar reverse-engineering sleuthing techniques Valadon chased down the card\u2019s CPU, a Toshiba Media-embedded Processor (MeP).Once he accurately identified system firmware, OS and components, the PoC exploit could proceed. \u201cI was really surprised to discover that the card is using an operating system and chips architecture that seems unknown to the security community,\u201d he said.\u201cFirst, I would like to look for remote vulnerabilities. I am was really interested in the 802.11 component of the card,\u201d he said.Valadon eventually targeted vulnerabilities in the card\u2019s DHCP, HTTP and 802.11 networking. He then cracked open the card and manually updated the firmware with his own. From there code execution was possible remotely within proximity of the card\u2019s WiFi range.\u201cThis is the first time that native code execution on the FlashAir is described. Moreover, this is likely a typical example of a complex analysis of an embedded system,\u201d he said.For Valadon, the hack allows him to wirelessly display images on his non-wired picture frame. Other applications, he said, could include an on-the-fly auto-encrypt feature for images when photographers are taking pictures in prohibitive environments. Or perhaps rerouting images stored on the camera to be sent to a third-party.Black HatHacksPrivacy",

        "raw text": "The United States Justice Department on Friday announced 12 indictments against Russian nationals, accusing them of engaging in a \u201csustained effort\u201d to hack Democrats\u2019 emails and computer networks.According to Rod Rosenstein, United States deputy Attorney General, all 12 defendants are members of the GRU, a Russian federation intelligence agency. Rosenstein accused all 12 of involvement in hacking Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. It accuses them of intention to \u201crelease that information on the internet under the names DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0.\u201dThe Justice Department was careful to stress that there is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged criminal activity and that no assertion is being made that alleged criminal activity \u201caltered the vote count or changed the outcome of the 2016 election.\u201dRosenstein said the 12 that were indicted were officials in Unit 26165 and Unit 74455 of the Russian government\u2019s Main Intelligence Directorate.The DOJ alleges, in 2016, officials in Unit 26165 began targeting volunteers and employees of the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, including the campaign\u2019s chairman, with spear phishing messages.The release of embarrassing DNC documents humiliated\u00a0Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta and eventually lead to the resignation of\u00a0then-DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz.\u201cThrough that process, officials in this unit were able to steal the usernames and passwords for numerous individuals and use those credentials to steal email content and hack into other computers,\u201d according to the Justice Department. \u00a0\u201cThey also were able to hack into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) through these spearphishing techniques to steal emails and documents, covertly monitor the computer activity of dozens of employees, and implant hundreds of files of malicious computer code to steal passwords and maintain access to these networks.\u201dThe indictment also accuses Unit 26165 with collaborating with Unit 74455 \u201cto plan the release of the stolen documents for the purpose of interfering with the 2016 presidential election.\u201d Rosenstein said that the defendants registered the domain DCLeaks.com, which was later used to release thousands of stolen emails and documents under the guise of being \u201cAmerican hacktavists.\u201dThe groups allegedly used\u00a0fake Facebook and Twitter accounts to promote the DCLeaks.com website.\u201cAfter public accusations that the Russian government was behind the hacking of DNC and DCCC computers, defendants created the fictitious persona Guccifer 2.0. On the evening of June 15, 2016 between 4:19PM and 4:56PM, defendants used their Moscow-based server to search for a series of English words and phrases that later appeared in Guccifer 2.0\u2019s first blog post falsely claiming to be a lone Romanian hacker responsible for the hacks in the hopes of undermining the allegations of Russian involvement,\u201d according to the Justice Department.The alleged hacking didn\u2019t stop at the Clinton campaign and also included \u201cstate boards of elections, secretaries of state, and US companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of elections to steal voter data stored on those computers.\u201dIn all, Russian nationals face 11 criminal counts:Count One alleges a criminal conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States through cyber operations by the GRU that involved the staged release of stolen documents for the purpose of interfering with the 2016 president election;Counts Two through Nine charge aggravated identity theft for using identification belonging to eight victims to further their computer fraud scheme;Count Ten alleges a conspiracy to launder money in which the defendants laundered the equivalent of more than $95,000 by transferring the money that they used to purchase servers and to fund other costs related to their hacking activities through cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; andCount Eleven charges conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States by attempting to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and US companies that supplied software and other technology related to the administration of elections.Hacks",

        "raw text": "UPDATE \u2013\u00a0Over the last few years,\u00a0automakers like Ford, Jeep, Nissan and Toyota have all suffered car-hacking vulnerabilities in their vehicles. Now, \u00a0it looks like Volkswagen has been pulled into the mix after researchers discovered that\u00a0in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems in certain Volkswagen-manufactured cars could be remotely hacked.Not only that, but it\u2019s possible to pivot to more critical systems.The vulnerability was discovered in\u00a0the Volkswagen Golf GTE and an Audi3 Sportback e-tron, which were both manufactured in 2015. Computest researchers Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade, who discovered the flaw, said that under certain conditions the IVI vulnerability could enable\u00a0attackers to commandeer the on-board microphone to listen in on the conversations of the driver, turn the microphone on and off, and access the system\u2019s complete address book and the conversation history. There is also a possibility of hackers tracking the car through the navigation system at any given time, they said.A Volkswagen spokesperson told Threatpost that\u00a0the vehicles impacted are those produced with Discover Pro infotainment systems \u2013 Golf GTE and Audi A3 e-tron.\u201cWe have been in contact with Computest since mid-2017,\u201d the spokesperson told Threatpost. \u201cThe bug fix \u2013 in other words eliminating the vulnerability \u2013 had already taken place in early May 2016.\u201dThe spokesperson stressed that \u201cfrom what is currently known, it is impossible for [attackers] to manipulate the brakes, steering or vehicle access systems.\u201dThe researchers said they were able to leverage an undisclosed vulnerability in Harman-manufactured modular infotainment (MIB) platforms in the affected car models to access the IVI system remotely via Wi-Fi. Then, they exploited an exposed port to gain access to the management software of the system:\u00a0\u201cWe can remotely compromise the MIB IVI system and from there send arbitrary CAN [control area networks] messages on the IVI CAN bus,\u201d they said in a\u00a0report. \u201cAs a result, we can control the central screen, speakers and microphone. This is a level of access that no attacker should be able to achieve.\u201dBeyond an Annoyance HackThe researchers initially found they could use the vulnerability to read arbitrary files from disk, but quickly found that they could expand their possibilities into full remote-code execution.\u00a0The access didn\u2019t stop there: Through the vulnerability, Computest researchers also found that they could access the IVI system\u2019s multimedia applications unit (MMX) main processor, which is responsible for tasks like screen compositing and multimedia decoding. From there,\u00a0they were able to \u00a0control the radio and car control unit (RCC).\u201cThe next step would be to send arbitrary CAN messages over the bus to see if we can reach any safety critical components,\u201d said the report.However, sending an arbitrary CAN message to the CAN bus would involve hacking a chip that is directly connected to a \u00a0gateway, and is used to firewall messages between different CAN buses. At this point, Computest researchers said that they decided to drop their research, as it would require extracting the firmware from the chip using a physical vector.\u201cAfter careful consideration we decided to discontinue our research at this point, since this would potentially compromise intellectual property of the manufacturer and potentially break the law,\u201d Computest researchers said.Not Fixable OTAComputest brought its research to Volkswagen in the summer of 2017.\u00a0Keuper said that in April 2018, Volkswagen provided Computest with a letter confirming the vulnerabilities, and stating that they have been fixed in a software update to the infotainment system \u2013 meaning that cars produced since the update will not be impacted by the vulnerabilities.Despite the fact that Volkswagen has fixed cars currently being produced, the Computest researchers stressed that they would not disclose further details about the vulnerability because the updates are not able to be made over-the-air (OTA); as a result, affected car owners have to to meet with their dealers for a fix.\u201cThe system we investigated can also not be updated by the end user itself, a user needs to go to an official dealer to receive an update,\u201d Keuper told Threatpost in an email. \u201cHowever, based on our experience, it seems that cars which have been produced before are not automatically updated when being serviced at a dealer, thus are still vulnerable to the described attack.\u201dIn an ideal world, instead of having to proactively request an update themselves at the\u00a0dealer, consumers should get the updates pushed automatically OTA, similar to a smartphone, said Keuper.\u201cThis is also the key point in our research: these are all problems we can fix in the car of\u00a0tomorrow, for example by enabling OTA updates,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what about the cars that are sold today? They will be around for the next 15 to 18 years and will most likely never receive security updates.\u201dCar security issues \u2013 and how manufacturers respond to them \u2013 were put on the forefront after researchers Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek famously remotely hacked a 2014 Jeep Cherokee\u00a0to control the braking, steering and acceleration of the vehicle in 2015. Since then, the attack surface for many vehicles has only expanded as infotainment systems and other Wi-Fi-enabled capabilities have become increasingly popular in cars. \u00a0\u00a0For now, owners of impacted vehicles need to make sure they explicitly ask for security updates, Keuper told Threatpost. Meanwhile, manufacturers can also adopt security measures to tighten security, such as including third-party components as part of quality and security assurance measures.\u00a0IoTVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 Researchers have identified the hacking group behind several widescale business email compromise (BEC) attacks gouging the\u00a0maritime shipping industry millions of dollars since last year. Attackers are taking advantage of the industry\u2019s lax security and the use of outdated computers, according to a report released here at the RSA Conference Wednesday.Researchers from the Dell SecureWorks Counter Threat Unit dubbed the BEC group Gold Galleon. The researchers estimate that Gold Galleon has specifically targeted the shipping industry in an attempt to steal at least $3.9 million between June 2017 and January 2018.Gold Galleon\u2019s targets include maritime shipping organizations \u2013 such as companies providing ship management services, port services and cash to master services. Because the shipping industry is globally dispersed and operates in different time zones, they are completely reliant on email for communication \u2013 and thus a \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d for BEC scams, said James Bettke, security researcher at SecureWorks, who led the research into the group.\u201cThere\u2019s a couple reasons [Gold Galleon] would target this industry\u2026 it\u2019s a perfect storm between the lack of security and an interesting cultural piece,\u201d said Bettke in an interview with Threatpost. \u201cMany shipping companies that are very small are not worried about security \u2013 they don\u2019t have two factor authentication and are running Windows XP. The second piece is that many of these small companies are doing international business and communicating primarily with email, so it\u2019s hard to know if someone is being impersonated.\u201dSecureWorks found that Gold Galleon appears to be a group of at least 20 cybercriminals, who likely are based in Nigeria. The criminals work together to carry out various parts of the BEC campaigns \u2013 from the initial compromise, to monitoring accounts.Gold Galleon identifies target emails by collecting publicly available contact information, such as the company\u2019s website as well as leveraging marketing tools BoxxerMail or Email Extractor to scrape email addresses from companies\u2019 websites, according to SecureWorks.After gaining entry into a target\u2019s inbox, the cybercriminals will also extract a recipient\u2019s contacts through a tool called EmailPicky.Gold Galleon uses spearphishing techniques with malicious attachments to compromise their victims.These attachments contain a remote access tool with keylogging and password stealing functionality: \u201cTools deployed by GOLD GALLEON include the Predator Pain, PonyStealer, Agent Tesla and Hawkeye keyloggers. All of the malware leveraged by GOLD GALLEON is readily available from online hacking markets,\u201d according to SecureWorks\u2019 report.Once the group compromises the email accounts, members of the crew monitor the employees\u2019 inbox to identify emails for ongoing business transactions.When it is time for payment details to be relayed to the buyer through an invoice, the threat actor intercepts the seller\u2019s email and changes the destination bank account on the invoice to their money mule account.\u201cIn order to impersonate a buyer or seller in a particular transaction, GOLD GALLEON and other BEC groups, have been observed purchasing\u00a0\u00a0domains which closely resemble the buyer or seller\u2019s company name, they refer to this as \u2018cloning,'\u201d according to SecureWorks.The group uses a range of commodity remote access tools that have keylogging and password-stealing functionality to steal email account credentials. \u00a0Senior members of Gold Galleon will also routinely test malware on their own systems and tracks detection rates via online virus scanners, Bettke said.After sifting through usernames and passwords for the group, SecureWorks also linked Gold Galleon to a popular fraternity in Nigeria called the Buccaneer Confraternity or the National Association of Seadog.The Bucaneers Confraternity was originally established in Nigeria to support human right in the country \u2013 but reports suggest that a small subset of the group could engage in criminal activity.To mitigate attacks, SecureWorks suggests that potential victims implement two factor authentication, and inspect corporate email control panels for suspicious redirect rules.\u201cThe malware they use is very unsophisticated,\u201d said Bettke. \u201cI suggest companies in the maritime industry adopt two factor authentication and stronger accounting controls, so if someone out of the blue asks to change accounts, company employees should get on the phone instead of corresponding via email.\u201dMalwareRSACVulnerabilities",

Here is a roundup of leading research, themes and buzz from this year\u2019s shows.\nResearch of NoteVideo conferencing darling Zoom was highlighted at DEF CON by Patrick Wardle, founder of the Objective-See Foundation, for a hacking technique that allowed him, using the macOS version of Zoom, to elevated privileges and gain access to the entire macOS operating system.Pen Test Partners revealed a flaw in the Electronic Flight Bag tablets used by some Boeing aircraft pilots that could have allowed an adversary to modify data \u201cand cause pilots to make dangerous miscalculations,\u201d according to a Reuters report.Starlink, the satellite operated by SpaceX that provides internet access to over 36 countries, was shown vulnerable to a hack via a $25 modchip. Belgian researcher Lennert Wouters revealed at Black Hat how he mounted a successful fault injection attack on a user terminal used to manage the satellite.Researcher James Kettle debuted a new class of HTTP request smuggling attack that allowed him to compromise Amazon and Akamai, break TLS, and exploit Apache servers, according to reporting from Portswigger\u2019s The Daily Swig.Journalist Eduard Kovacs reported on a high-severity Realtek bug in the company\u2019s eCos SDK. Found by Faraday Security and discussed at DEF CON, the eCos SDK is used in a variety of routers, access points and network repeaters, according to his report.For fans of FUD, PC Magazine has a nice rundown of \u201cThe 14 Scariest Things We Saw at Black Hat 2022\u201c. Things keeping them up are SMS codes flunk MFA, an \u201cinvisible finger to take control\u201d of your touchscreen device and a Microsoft hiccup when launching its Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM).Topics of DiscussionThe main Black Hat keynote was from Chris Krebs, former Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), who shared his optimism when it comes to the US approach to information security. However, he did express pessimism that US cyber-defenses were too focused on nation state attackers versus more mundane and pressing concerns, in his estimation, such as ransomware.Ukraine war and Log4j also were major themes at each of the conferences. ESET provided Black Hat attendees with an update on cyberattacks against Ukraine. Firms such as CyCognito warned that we aren\u2019t out of the Log4j woods. A report by SiliconAngle \u00a0quotes Robert Silvers, undersecretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security, echoed those concerns telling attendees that \u201c[Log4j] is most likely that organizations are going to deal with Log4j issues for at least a decade and maybe longer.\u201dVictor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine\u2019s State Special Communications Service, told Black Hat attendees that his country\u2019s infrastructure has experienced a 300 percent uptick in cyber incidents since Russia\u2019s invasion of the country. The visit was unannounced, according to a\u00a0Voice of America report.Meanwhile current White House Cyber Director Chris Inglis told journalist Kim Zetter, during a DEF CON session, that he was focused on \u201c\u2018three waves of attacks\u2019 that have progressed in recent years,\u201d according a Nextgov report.The first wave \u201cfocused on adversaries holding data and systems at risk.\u201d In the second, the attackers \u201cstill held data and systems at risk, but they then abstracted that into holding critical functions at risk.\u201d The third is an attack on confidence, as exemplified by the attack on the Colonial Pipeline. \u2013 Nextgov.For DEF CON, it was the event\u2019s 30th anniversary, which events organizers billed as not a birthday but a Hacker Homecoming.\u201cThis has been a crazy couple of years,\u201d according to an official DEF CON forum post.\u201cA global pandemic turned DEF CON 28 into DEF CON Safe Mode. Some easing of the restrictions and some strict attendance rules gave us a hybrid con for DC29. An improvement, to be sure, but something short of a full DEF CON experience\u2026 We want DEF CON 30 to have the energy of a reunion\u2026 In honor of all that, we\u2019re calling DEF CON 30 \u2018Hacker Homecoming\u2019.\u201dBlack HatGovernmentHacksMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The Russian government is exploring \u201coptions for potential cyberattacks\u201d on critical infrastructure in the U.S., the White House warned on Monday, in retaliation for sanctions and other punishments as the war in Ukraine grinds on.Officials said that its latest intelligence shows cyber-related \u201cpreparatory activity\u201d on the part of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government, though White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology Anne Neuberger emphasized that no concrete threat has been identified.\u201cTo be clear, there is no certainty there will be a cyber-incident on critical infrastructure,\u201d she told reporters during a briefing. She added, \u201cThere is no evidence of any specific cyberattack that we are anticipating. There is some preparatory activity that we\u2019re seeing and that is what we shared in a classified context with companies who we thought might be affected.\u201dThat observed prep work includes vulnerability scanning and website probing, she added, declining to add any specifics. She noted that officials were holding more detailed classified briefings with organizations they believe could be targeted.\u201cThe current conflict has put cybersecurity initiatives in hyperdrive, and today, industry leaders aren\u2019t just concerned about adversaries breaching critical infrastructure but losing access and control to them,\u201d Saket Modi, co-founder and CEO at Safe Security, said via email.In tandem with the briefing, the White House released a cyber-preparedness fact sheet, and President Joe Biden issued the following statement:\u201cI have previously warned about the potential that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the United States, including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs we\u2019ve imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners. It\u2019s part of Russia\u2019s playbook. Today, my Administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence that the Russian Government is exploring options for potential cyberattacks.\u201dThe fact sheet contains basic advice for hardening cyber-defenses, including employee awareness education; implementing multifactor authentication; keeping patching up-to-date; ensuring backups for data; turning on encryption; red-team exercises; and updating security tools.\u201cThis is a call to action and a call to responsibility for all of us,\u201d Neuberger said, again citing a \u201cpotential shift in intention\u201d by Russia.Organizations Are Not Prepared for Russian AttacksJason Rebholz, CISO at Corvus Insurance, noted that basic cyber-hardening should have begun long ago.\u201cThe White House\u2019s best practices echo security fundamentals \u2013 something every organization should strive for,\u201d he said via email. \u201cFor many organizations, the time to implement was several years ago, as the frequency and severity of attacks began to escalate. Like planting a tree, the best time to secure your organization was ten years ago. The next best time is today. Organizations that have not addressed the key items and hardened their cyber-defenses are at a significantly greater risk of compromise.\u201dBeyond the basics, there are other challenges in being prepared for an onslaught from Russia\u2019s considerable cyber-arsenal, Modi said.\u201cWhile governments and businesses have started pivoting towards proactive cybersecurity, it is difficult to do so without addressing the three major challenges in cybersecurity that organizations face,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are too many cybersecurity products that do not communicate with each other, and this siloed approach leads to managing cybersecurity reactively. Finally, despite increased attention on the need for a better disclosure mechanism of cyberattacks, cybersecurity communication continues to be a challenge since it often lacks a business context.\u201dMeanwhile, Danny Lopez, CEO at Glasswall, pointed out that the real risk involves zero-day exploits and other unknown threats.\u201cPutin is playing a long game. War is costly both in terms of human and economic terms. If we see a de-escalation of the situation on the ground, we are likely to see an escalation of cyber warfare,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cThere are no patches for [unknown zero-day] and they wreak havoc within hours, whilst the security services and technology industry tries to catch up. These are extremely dangerous to governments as well as businesses.\u201dThe bottom line is that organizations should assume that attacks are imminent, researchers concluded.\u201cIt is a confusing time that involves two nations that have historically possessed and demonstrated very good skills in the cybersecurity and cybercrime areas,\u201d noted Purandar Das, co-founder and CEO at Sotero, via email. \u201cCountries under duress have and will utilize cyberattacks as a way to retaliate and to get around sanctions. The U.S. being the face of such sanctions and a history of poorly protected infrastructure make it a tempting target.

        "raw text": "The White House has denied reports that President Biden has been presented with an arsenal of ways to launch massive cyberattacks against Russia \u2013 attacks designed to disrupt the country\u2019s ability to sustain its military operations in Ukraine.NBC News on Thursday reported that the options included \u201cdisrupting internet connectivity across Russia, shutting off electric power, and tampering with railroad switches to hamper Russia\u2019s ability to resupply its forces.\u201dRussia\u2019s military forces have been deployed in a \u200bfull-scale attack against Ukraine.Within hours of the report, press secretary Jen Psaki said in a tweet that NBC got it wrong: \u201cThis report on cyber options being presented to @POTUS is off base and does not reflect what is actually being discussed in any shape or form,\u201d she said.This report on cyber options being presented to @POTUS is off base and does not reflect what is actually being discussed in any shape or form.\u2014 Jen Psaki (@PressSec) February 24, 2022The outlet\u2019s sources \u2013 \u201ctwo U.S. intelligence officials, one Western intelligence official and another person briefed on the matter\u201d \u2013 told NBC that no final decisions had been made as of earlier on Thursday.One of those sources said the possibilities range from the aggravating to the destructive: \u201cYou could do everything from slow the trains down to have them fall off the tracks,\u201d said the source, who\u2019d been briefed on the matter.But that source also said that most of the potential measures on the slate of possible cyberattacks (a slate that, again, press secretary Psaki said was inaccurate) wouldn\u2019t be destructive but would, rather, be designed to be disruptive, hence falling short of an act of war by the United States against Russia, according to NBC.Would the U.S. Be Prepared for Retaliation?NBC\u2019s sources said that the purported slate of cyberattack options were allegedly presented irrespective of the likelihood that Russia would retaliate.And retaliate it would, cybersecurity experts predicted, whether in response to sanctions, to any arms/material support the United States may choose to send to the Ukrainian resistance, or to whatever cyberattacks the country might launch.Mark Moses, director of client engagement at application security provider nVisium, told Threatpost via email on Thursday that Russian cyberattacks against critical U.S. infrastructure and economic assets \u201cwill escalate rapidly if the United States takes a real stance against the annexation of Ukraine to Russia.\u201dIn fact, government outfits and key businesses should already be bolstering defenses and ensuring that redundant systems are in place, he said, as defense against state-level actors \u201cis at another level from defense against the average Internet threat actor.\u201dThere\u2019s already been a swirl of malicious cyber-action that\u2019s coincided with Russia\u2019s deployment of troops to Ukraine.On Tuesday, a wave of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks hit institutions central to Ukraine\u2019s government, military and economy, including banks.In addition, Cybersecurity firms ESET and Broadcom\u2019s Symantec earlier this week reported that new data-wiping malware, dubbed HermeticWiper, was discovered on hundreds of machines on Ukrainian networks.In a Thursday post, the Digital Shadows Photon Research team noted that researchers found that in some cases the malware had been compiled in December 2021, \u201cindicating that the attack had been prepared in advance.\u201d  Other research identified that HermeticWiper was deployed directly from Windows domain controllers, indicating [it\u2019s] realistically possible that attackers may have had prolonged access prior to execution.\u201dHitesh Sheth, President and CEO at cybersecurity company Vectra, told Threatpost that it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d for the United States\u2019 organizations and government bodies to fortify defenses while the government considers offensive options. \u201cGoing on the offensive without the right technology to defend ourselves in cyber space would be bad strategy,\u201d he declared.John Hellickson, field CISO and executive advisor at cybersecurity advisory services provider Coalfire, agreed that retaliation by Russia could have \u201cdevastating\u201d impacts on essential services in the United States. He told Threatpost via email on Thursday that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work here at home to ensure that such retaliatory attacks could be sufficiently thwarted, \u201cas evidenced by very public ransomware and similar attacks of recent.\u201dHellickson preached caution: \u201cWe need to avoid crossing the line of such considerations as it\u2019s difficult to predict the impacts of a likely retaliation,\u201d he advised.More to ComeDigital Shadows is foretelling that Russia will launch yet more malicious cyber-action targeting Ukraine. Cyberattacks could extend beyond Ukraine, researchers predicted, with future attacks potentially affecting NATO and EU member states.\u201cThis has already been observed with HermeticWiper impacting networks in Latvia and Lithuania,\u201d Digital Shadows pointed out. The researchers compared the situation to the 2017 global NotPetya attacks: attacks allegedly tied to Russian military intelligence.\u201cIt is also realistically possible that the financial services, energy, and oil & gas sectors in particular are under an increased risk from Russian aligned threat actors,\u201d Digital Shadows suggested. \u201cTargeting oil & gas in Europe, for example, could serve to cause concern among nation-states dependent on Russian energy.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "A new ransomware family, White Rabbit, chewed through a local U.S. bank last month \u2014 and it may be connected to the financially motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as FIN8, researchers said.In a Tuesday report, Trend Micro researchers said that this twicky wabbit knows how to burrow away where it can\u2019t be spotted. In fact, it looks like the operators behind the White Rabbit ransomware have taken a page from the more established ransomware family known as Egregor when it comes to hiding their malicious activity, researchers said.Egregor, which claimed responsibility for a well-publicized cyberattack on Barnes & Noble in October 2020, is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) player that sparked an FBI warning after compromising more than 150 organizations in short order after its birth.White Rabbit may be sneaky, but it leaves tracks. The ransomware was spotted by multiple security outfits, and was first detected on Dec. 14 by the Lodestone Forensic Investigations team, which said that it had seen some White Rabbit activity a few days earlier, on Dec. 11.But the earliest stirrings date back to July 10, when a PowerShell script was executed \u2013 a script that held script blocks that matched those described in a July 27 Bitdefender article on FIN8.The Dec. 14 White Rabbit attack was also publicly disclosed on Twitter that same day by security researcher Michael Gillespie (@demonslay355).\ud83d\udd12 #Ransomware Hunt: \"White Rabbit\" with extension \".scrypt\", drops note for each encrypted file with \"<filename>.scrypt.txt\" with victim-specific information: https://t.co/ZjVay8A3Ch\"Follow the White Rabbit\u2026\" \ud83d\udc30\ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/lhzHi5t1KK\u2014 Michael Gillespie (@demonslay335) December 14, 2021Gillespie included a link to the ransom note, which includes cutesy bunny ASCII art. The note warns victims that if they\u2019re reading it, their network infrastructure has been compromised, their critical data has leaked and their files are encrypted. In other words, the newcomer is using the same double-extortion shtick used by a skyrocketing number of RaaS players, threatening targets that their stolen data isn\u2019t just encrypted but will also be published or sold.Ransom note. Source: Gillespie\u2019s upload to PasteBin.Command-Line Password \u2018KissMe\u2019 Used to Hide Bad ActsIt gets cutesy-wutesy-er: Trend Micro researchers said that one of the most notable aspects of the new ransomware\u2019s attack is the use of a specific command-line password to decrypt its internal configuration and launch its ransomware routine. In the particular case that they came across, that password is \u201cKissMe,\u201d as shown in the SysTracer screen capture below. SysTracer is a system utility tool that sniffs out changed data in a system\u2019s registry and files.Command line, showing the password \u201cKissMe,\u201d used to execute the ransomware. Source: Trend Micro.\u201cThis method of hiding malicious activity is a trick that the ransomware family Egregor uses to hide malware techniques from analysis,\u201d the Trend Micro researchers pointed out, adding that \u201cother samples might use a different password\u201d than KissMe.The SysTracer image also shows the arguments accepted by the ransomware, which, researchers surmised, stand in for:-p: password/passphrase-f: file to be encrypted-l: logfile-t: malware\u2019s start timeCobalt Strike Link to FIN8Trend Micro picked up on traces of Cobalt Strike commands \u2013 the PowerShell .exe, as shown below \u2013 that its researchers think \u201cmight have been used to reconnoiter, infiltrate and drop the malicious payload into the affected system,\u201d according to the report.Traces of Cobalt Strike commands. Source: Trend Micro.Lodestone\u2019s analysis of the ransomware group\u2019s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) points to the White Rabbit group potentially being affiliated with FIN8.FIN8 has typically used social engineering and spear-phishing to go after financial services and payment-card data from point-of-sale (PoS) systems \u2013 particularly those of retailers, restaurants and the hotel industry. More recently, it has added ransomware to its bag of trucks. It\u2019s been active since at least January 2016 and periodically pops in and out of dormancy in order to fine-tune its TTPs so as to evade detection and ramp up its success rate.One example was in August, when the latest refinement of the APT\u2019s BadHatch backdoor proved able to leverage new malware on the fly without redeployment, making it potent and nimble.Besides BadHatch, FIN8\u2019s well-stocked arsenal has included malware variants such as ShellTea \u2013 a backdoor also known as PunchBuggy \u2013and the memory-scraping malware PunchTrack.In the December attack, White Rabbit dragged in a previously unseen version of BadHatch that, based on characteristics of the malware sample acquired, Lodestone named F5.\u201cThe exact relationship between the White Rabbit group and FIN8 is currently unknown,\u201d Lodestone stipulated. \u201cHowever, Lodestone identified a number of TTPs suggesting that White Rabbit, if operating independently of FIN8, has a close relationship with the more established threat group or is mimicking them.\u201dWhite Rabbit\u2019s Ransomware PathAs Trend Micro tells it, the White Rabbit ransomware creates a note for each file it encrypts. \u201cEach note bears the name of the encrypted file and is appended with \u2018.scrypt.txt,'\u201d researchers described. \u201cPrior to the ransomware routine, the malware also terminates several processes and services, particularly antivirus-related ones.\u201dNext, if the -f argument isn\u2019t given, it tries to encrypt files in fixed, removable and network drives, as well as in resources. Trend Micro provided the list below of the paths and directories the ransomware tries to skip, \u201cto avoid crashing the system and destroying its own notes.\u201d*.scrypt.txt*.scryptc:\\windows\\**:\\sysvol\\**:\\netlogon\\*c:\\filesource\\**.exe*.dll*\\desktop.ini*:\\windows\\*c:\\programdata\\**:\\programfiles\\**:\\program files (x86)\\**:\\program files (x64)\\**.lnk*.iso*.msi*.sys*.inf%User Temp%\\**\\thumbs.dbFIN8 Connection Still a Bit SketchyFIN8 and White Rabbit may be related, or they might actually share the same creator: It\u2019s not a solid call just yet, Trend Micro said.It could be that this is just another indication of how the group is doing what it\u2019s known for: expanding its arsenal, past the infiltration and reconnaissance tools for which it\u2019s well-known, to add ransomware to the toolkit. \u201cSo far, White Rabbit\u2019s targets have been few, which could mean that they are still testing the waters or warming up for a large-scale attack,\u201d Trend Micro researchers noted.It has an \u201cuncomplicated\u201d ransomware routine, which likely means that it\u2019s still under development, they said. Despite being a simple piece of malware, it\u2019s still dangerous: \u201cDespite being in this early stage, however, it is important to highlight that it bears the troublesome characteristics of modern ransomware: It is, after all, highly targeted and uses double extortion methods,\u201d according to Trend Micro\u2019s writeup. \u201cAs such, it is worth monitoring.\u201dBlocking White Rabbit AttacksBoth Lodestone and Trend Micro included indicators of compromise in their White Rabbit writeups.Trend Micro also had the following suggestions for setting up a multilayered defense to \u201chelp guard against modern ransomware and prevent the success of the evasion tactics they employ\u201d:Deploy cross-layered detection and response solutions. Find solutions that can anticipate and respond to ransomware activities, techniques, and movements before the threat culminates.Create a playbook for attack prevention and recovery. Both an incident-response (IR) playbook and IR frameworks allow organizations to plan for different attacks, including ransomware.Conduct attack simulations. Expose employees to a realistic cyberattack simulation that can help decision-makers, security personnel, and IR teams identify and prepare for potential security gaps and attacks.Photo courtesy of PxHere.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Amazon and Google patched a domain name service (DNS) bug that allowed attackers to snoop on the confidential networking settings of companies \u2013 revealing computer and employee names along with office locations and exposed web resources.The vulnerability, outlined in a Black Hat USA 2021 talk last week, is a new class of vulnerabilities affecting major DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers, according to researchers at the cloud security firm Wiz.Ami Luttwak, co-founder and CTO of Wiz, said the bug allows an adversary to conduct unprecedented reconnaissance on a target \u2013 namely any vulnerable corporate network that inadvertently allows this type of network eavesdropping.While Amazon and Google have patched the bug, Luttwak warns the problem is likely widespread.Threatpost caught up with Luttwak at Black Hat and in the video below.Wiz revealed the vulnerability affecting DNSaaS providers Amazon Route53 and Google Cloud DNS, which both promptly patched the bug in February.Going Down the DNS Loophole \u201cWe found a simple loophole that allowed us to intercept a portion of worldwide dynamic DNS traffic going through managed DNS providers like Amazon and Google. Essentially, we \u2018wiretapped\u2019 the internal network traffic of 15,000 organizations (including Fortune 500 companies and government agencies) and millions of devices,\u201d Wiz wrote in a technical breakdown of the bug.Luttwak calls what he found a \u201cloophole\u201d within the process used to handle the now obsolete dynamic DNS within modern DNS server configurations.\u201cWe registered a new domain on the Route 53 platform with the same name as their official DNS server. (Technically, we created a new \u2018hosted zone\u2019 inside AWS name server ns-1611.awsdns-09.co.uk and named it \u2018ns-852.awsdns-42.net\u2019),\u201d researchers explained.Next, researchers gained control of the hosted zone by registering thousands of domain name servers as the same name as the DNSaaS official DNS server. \u201cWhenever a DNS client queries this name server about itself (which thousands of devices do automatically to update their IP address within their managed network \u2013 more on that in a minute), that traffic goes directly to our IP address,\u201d Wiz wrote.What researchers observed next was a flood of dynamic DNS traffic from Windows machines that were querying the \u201chijacked name server\u201d about itself. In all, researchers profiled 15,000 organizations (some Fortune 500 companies), 45 U.S. government agencies and 85 international government agencies.Misconfiguration or Vulnerability? DNSaaS providers Route53 and Google Cloud DNS fixed the issue by disallowing the type of copycat registration that mirrored their own DNS server.As for Microsoft, researchers said that the company considered this to be a misconfiguration issue.\u201cMicrosoft could provide a global solution by updating its dynamic DNS algorithm. However, when we reported our discovery to Microsoft, they told us that they did not consider it a vulnerability but rather a known misconfiguration that occurs when an organization works with external DNS resolvers,\u201d researchers said.Luttwak said that companies can avoid this type of DNS exploitation by configuring their DNS resolvers properly so dynamic DNS updates do not leave the internal network.Worried about where the next attack is coming from? We\u2019ve got your back.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Researchers recently demonstrated the weaponization of\u00a0 deep neural networks that can be used to shape public opinion, enrage people on Twitter and possibly spark QAnon 2.0.The research, presented last week at Black Hat by Drew Lohn, senior fellow at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, is based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) technology. This is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) designed to generate realistic text-based responses to language-based datasets.The second-generation version of GPT (GPT-2), developed by Elon-Musk-founded OpenAI in 2019, is best known for its ability to create news articles, stories and social-media posts that are indistinguishable as fake or real. This version was deemed \u201ctoo dangerous to release\u201d by some \u2014 including the company that developed it. OpenAI wrote on its own website \u201cdue to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology\u201d only researchers were given access to the full trained AI model.\nWhy is it considered dangerous? Feed it a snippet of text, and GPT-2 can be programmed to sift through 1.5 billion machine-learning language factors (40GB) to generate startlingly relevant content. The fear is that in the wrong hands, the tool could be used by adversaries to flood the internet with reasonable-sounding misinformation and fake news stories.To get a tiny taste of the power of GPT-2, researchers at InferKit created a light-version of the tool into which users can input text, and the AI will generate relevant text adding to the inputted thought.GPT-3: From AI Menace to Social-Media Monster In the context of social media, Lohn told Black Hat attendees that the newest version of GPT (GPT-3), released in May 2020, is even more powerful and potentially menacing. Where GPT-2 sorted through 1.5 billion parameters, GPT-3 sifts through 175 billion parameters.It can easily be programmed, he said, to draw on the firehose of text-based opinions shared on social media. It can generate AI replies specifically designed to spark divisions, spread malicious lies and promote a toxic point of view.\u201cBased on six months of privileged access to GPT-3, our research tries to answer just how useful GPT-3 can be for information operators looking to spread lies and deceit,\u201d Lohn said. \u201cIn the wrong hands, this tool can tear at the fabric of society and bring disinformation operations to an entirely new scale.\u201dIn the years since the 2016 U.S. presidential election, threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in launching disinformation campaigns \u2013 and staying under the radar to avoid detection from Facebook, Twitter and other platforms. GPT-3 represents one more way an adversary can\u00a0thwart mitigation efforts for these campaigns. Lohn, whose talk was based on an academic report published\u00a0earlier this year, said researchers trained GPT-3 to power an experimental AI army capable of influencing public opinion \u2013 and not for the better.In Lohn\u2019s tests, bot armies were created to auto-generate white supremacist, climate-change denying or QAnon-related tweets that reiterated disinformation or elaborated, manipulated, seeded, persuaded and wedged points of view. To help with believability, GPT-3 can also mimic the tone and style of writing of reputable sources.It should be noted that because of ethical considerations, none of the proof-of-concept disinformation campaigns were live.\u201cWhether GPT-3\u2019s messages would in fact resonate with QAnon followers is something we were unable to test ethically, and is a significant limitation on this part of our research,\u201d according to the report.Machine-Generated Biases for the Masses For its tests, researchers tapped Georgetown students as guinea pigs \u2013 who, after being shown tweets were asked if they thought the messages were believable.In one example, the system wrote 20 variations on an AP article, some left-leaning and some right-leaning. When shown to Georgetown students, at least one student believed that 11 of the 20 were authentic, he said.In the tests, GPT-3 was configured to dial up or down \u201cviolent and divisive\u201d rhetoric, Lohn said. Examples of different types of tweets created by the bots include a wedge tweet attempting to suppress voting by Christians:\u00a0 \u201cVoting doesn\u2019t save the soul of anyone. For a Christian to think that by voting they can change the course of history is absurd. The only way anyone is saved is by the blood of Christ,\u201d GPT-3 generated.A narrative-seeding example meanwhile attempted to mimic QAnon\u2019s style of communication. The tweet read: \u201cWhy was HRC so careless? Who is the enemy? Define. Expand your thinking. News unlocks past. We need to pray. God bless you all. Q.\u201d\u201cThis proof of concept suggests that GPT-3 easily matches the style of QAnon. The system creates its own narrative that fits within the conspiracy theory, drawing on QAnon\u2019s common villains, such as Hillary Clinton (referred to as \u201cHRC\u201d) and her staffer,\u201d according to researchers.The Cost of a CampaignHow far away are we from a world whose political landscape is colored by social-media bots? The good news is GPT-3 and GPT-2 require a great deal of computing power to run. Even GPT-2, which is available, often crashes systems due to its memory requirements, Lohn said.The infrastructure required to run a full-scale disinformation campaign is cost-prohibitive, too. For example, generating 90,000-words would cost $87.50. In comparison, generating a single Tweet would cost about $.02. Generating enough tweets to reach 1 percent Twitter users could cost $65 million a year, estimate researchers. While this might be too costly for most, a nation-state might be able to afford it within a small subset of Twitter and focused on one issue, Lohn said.An effective at-scale disinformation campaign would also require other overhead. Researchers estimate, in order to makes tweets believable \u2013 and without running afoul of spam detectors \u2013 adversaries would be required to create and maintain thousands of Twitter accounts.\u201cIn summary, GPT-2 and GPT-3 exist. \u00a0You can download GPT-2 for free and generate thousands and millions of different low-quality tweets. Once GPT-3 is available you can generate higher quality content. The cost will be more expensive if you want to do it at scale. But nation states will still be able to fire away at you at large volumes,\u201d Lohn said.Sharon Fisher \u2013 a digital nomad \u2013 contributed to this report.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Just weeks after the U.S. Senate confirmed Jen Easterly to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the new director spoke at Black Hat USA 2021 on Thursday, albeit virtually, announcing a major public-private partnership to fight cybercrime.Called the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), Easterly said 20 cybersecurity firms have already joined the effort. They include Amazon, AT&T, Google Cloud, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Verizon, Crowdstrike and FireEye Mandiant.She said ransomware will be the group\u2019s initial focus, along with creating a framework to respond to incidents affecting critical U.S. cyber-infrastructure.\u201cThe whole idea of JCDC is to bring together our partners to do four key things. First, to share insights so that we create a common operating picture, shared situational awareness of the threat environment so that we understand it better, and to develop national comprehensive cyber-defense plans to deal with the most significant threats to the nation threatening our critical infrastructure,\u201d she said.JCDC would also call on federal agencies that include Department of Defense and its cyber-command partners such as the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to \u201cmake sure that we are aligning operations, talents and capabilities to support the nation\u2019s cyber-defense activities,\u201d she said.Who is the New CISA Director?Easterly is a former NSA deputy for counterterrorism and has a long history within the U.S. intelligence community. She served for more than 20 years in the Army, where she is credited for creating the armed service\u2019s first cyber battalion. More recently she worked at Morgan Stanley as global head of the company\u2019s cybersecurity division.Easterly replaced CISA acting director Brandon Wales after the agency\u2019s founder and former director Christopher Krebs was fired by former President Trump in 2020.\u201cI hope to build on Chris\u2019s great work,\u201d Easterly said. \u201cChris did a fantastic job. He founded the agency and he shepherded CISA through some turbulent times, with the [2020] elections and COVID.\u201dShe likened her new position to that of a new CEO, fulfilling the spirit and mission of Krebs. \u201cI\u2019m going to be focused on how we put the right processes in place to be able to take CISA into our next five and 10 years,\u201d she said.For Those About to Hack, JC/DC is Gunning for YouBorrowing liberally from the design motif of the rock band AC/DC, Easterly debuted a tongue-in-cheek logo of JCDC (or JC/DC).She said JCDC represents a move by CISA to up its ante in working with the private sector. Several examples already this year \u2013 SolarWinds, Kaseya, PrintNightmare and ProxyLogon \u2013 are examples of the private sector aiding the federal response and helping shape cybersecurity policy.She singled out Victor Gevers, chair of the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure, for helping the agency understand the chain of vulnerabilities that led to the exploitation of Kaseya. During the height of the SolarWinds attack, Easterly said, Trimarc founder Sean Metcalf was instrumental in helping CISA understand the byzantine nature of identity management. She also thanked Will Dormann, a vulnerability analyst, for helping government security researchers understand \u201cthe pathways of interconnectedness\u201d associated with the PrintNightmare bug.In CISA We Trust? Perhaps Easterly\u2019s biggest challenge in her new role will not be heaping praise on the cybersecurity community. Rather, it will be earnings its trust. During a question-and-answer session, the CISA director scored points with the audience by stating that she supported strong encryption.\u201cI realized that there are other points of view across the government, but I think strong encryption is absolutely fundamental for us to be able to do what we need to do,\u201d she said.Strong encryption is jargon for what some call \u201cwarrant-proof\u201d encryption. Many in the law enforcement circles believe ironclad encryption helps criminals \u201cgo dark\u201d, in that it shields their communications.While acknowledging distrust within some segments of the cybersecurity community, Easterly urged the audience of security professionals to trust people first.\u201cWe know some people never want to trust an organization,\u201d she said. \u201cIn reality we trust people \u2013 you trust people. \u2026 When you work closely together with someone to solve problems, you can begin to create that trust.\u201d(Image of Jen Easterly, courtesy of Jen Easterly\u2019s Twitter feed)\u00a0Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Microsoft Windows 10 biometric user authentication systems Windows Hello can be bypassed, using a single infrared image of a user\u2019s face planted on a tampered clone of an external USB-based webcam.The vulnerability, tracked as (CVE-2021-34466, CVSS score: 5.7), was patched by Microsoft in July. However, according to research disclosed here at Black Hat USA 2021, the flaw still allows attackers \u2013 in some scenarios \u2013 to bypass Windows Hello and Windows Hello for Business, used for single-sign-on access to a user\u2019s computer and a host of Windows services and associated data.Security research Omer Tsarfati, with CyberArk Labs, outlined his research (dubbed Pass-the-PRT attack) that leveraged a custom-made USB device containing a spoofed image of a Windows 10 user.\u201cAll you need is a valid infrared frame of the target, which can be obtained relatively easily. Next, you need to take that data and put it into a cloned USB-based camera and plug it into the Windows 10 system targeted,\u201d Tsarfati said.It may sound like an easy hack, but the attack requires some heavy lifting on the adversary\u2019s part.CyberArk\u2019s Omer Tsarfati shows Threatpost the NXP (i.MX RT1050) circuit board used to mimic a USB camera to bypass Windows Hello.What is a Pass-the-PRT AttackGiving a nod to previous research on Windows ecosystem\u2019s tokens and encryption keys by Benjamin Delpy and Dirk-Jan Mollema, Tsarfati said his hack also sidesteps the need to acquire Azure AD (Active Directory) Primary Refresh Tokens (PRT) used for single sign-on access to Windows.For this reason, he calls the vulnerability a Pass-the-PRT bug. Similar to Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket, a Pass-the-PRT attack, is serious, given the fact that it gives an adversary access to not just local systems, but also Azure-related resources such as MSFT 365 assets.The soft underbelly of the Windows Hello biometric authentication platform, which includes PIN, fingerprint and facial recognition, is the reliance on the biometric sensor (camera), the research explained.\u201cAt the heart of this vulnerability lies the fact that Windows Hello allows external data sources, which can be manipulated, as a root of trust,\u201d Tsarfati said.Hardware Hack ExplainedThe relatively easy part of the hack was capturing the infrared image frame of a targeted victim. \u201cWith a $50 camera from a consumer electronics store you can easily capture a photo of the target. The hard part requires much more than an infrared image,\u201d he said. The challenge for Tsarfati was cloning the camera and the specific design descriptors that Windows uses to validate and trust an external USB camera. These are used with Microsoft\u2019s Windows Hello system to secure a USB session handshake by camera or webcam devices.\u201cUSB has a strict tree network topology and master/slave protocol for addressing peripheral devices. Once a USB device is connected to the computer bus via the USB port, the host starts a session with the peripheral device. After the session is established between the host and the USB device, the host will send multiple requests to identify the USB device, called descriptor requests,\u201d according to a technical breakdown posted by CyberArk.The post continues: \u201cThe host can\u2019t identify which device is connected to the USB port, and therefore it needs to get the information from the connected peripheral device. As unbelievable as it sounds, it means that every device can present itself as whatever it wants, and the host can\u2019t verify this. At least there is nothing in the specification that defines such a process.\u201dUsing tools (USBPcap and Wireshark) to capture the URB (USB Request Blocks) packets sent and received by the targeted PC to communicate and validate the Windows Hello authentication, researchers were able to clone a USB camera on a NXP circuit board with IR and RGB sensors. Next, they needed to understand how the cloned USB-based camera defined itself in terms of its USB capabilities and features via \u201cdescriptors that define the device interfaces, alternate settings and endpoints.\u201d\u201cWe aimed to create a clone that will act as the real camera, so we copied the configuration and the device descriptors,\u201d Tsarfati said.Easier said than done.Through massive trial-and-error, reverse engineering the USB descriptor specifications and cloning the precise USB handshake used by Windows Hello, the researcher finally hit pay dirt. \u201cOnce you have correctly captured and placed the frames in the custom USB camera, you will be able to bypass the login screen,\u201d he said.Video Demo of (CVE-2021-34466) Hack and AttackNot a Perfect PatchAfter five months of working with Microsoft on validating and breaking down the bug, Microsoft delivered a patch this past July.\u201cMicrosoft did release a fix that restricts the number of camera brands it supports with Windows Hello and restricts external cameras, unless a user permits,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the external camera restrictions are disabled by the user, the bypass still is possible.\u201dMicrosoft responded to CyberArk research, explaining that its July Patch Tuesday mitigation includes an allow list of USB devices that are trusted to be used in the Windows Hello authentication phase. \u201cMicrosoft released a security update on July 13 that mitigates this issue,\u201d it stated.\u201cIn addition, customers with Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security are protected against such attacks which tamper with the biometrics pipeline,\u201d Microsoft said in a statement. \u201cEnhanced Sign-in Security is a new security feature in Windows which requires specialized hardware, drivers, and firmware that are pre-installed on the system by device manufacturers in the factory.\u201dCyberArk responded on Wednesday, stating: \u201cAccording to our current assessment, exploitation of the vulnerability is still possible via duplication of an external trusted USB device due to the way trust is established.\u201dResearchers reported the vulnerability to Microsoft in March 2021. Microsoft acknowledge the vulnerability a month later. Microsoft published an advisory regarding mitigations on July 13.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 The suspected Iranian threat group that IBM Security X-Force calls ITG18 and which overlaps with the group known as Charming Kitten keeps leaving a trail of paw prints.The latest: a custom Android backdoor dubbed \u201cLittleLooter\u201d \u2013 used exclusively by the threat actor, as far as researchers have been able to determine \u2013 that IBM Security X-Force detailed for the first time at Black Hat USA 2021.On Wednesday, in a session titled \u201cThe Kitten that Charmed Me: The 9 Lives of a Nation State Attacker,\u201d X-Force researchers Allison Wikoff and Richard Emerson said you just have to laugh about all the errors the group keeps making. \u201cIf that is not amusing, I do not know what is,\u201d Wikoff said. \u201cAnd God, I love my job with things like this happening.\u201dLittleLooterMost recently, \u201cthings like this\u201d included X-Force\u2019s discovery of a file named \u201cWhatsApp.apk\u201d (md5: a04c2c3388da643ef67504ef8c6907fb) on infrastructure associated with ITG18 operations.X-Force determined that \u201cWhatsApp.apk\u201d was Android malware that the researchers dubbed \u201cLittleLooter\u201d based on its information-stealing capabilities.For command-and-control (C2) communication, LittleLooter attempts to establish communication to the C2 server via HTTP POST requests and responses. X-Force says that the C2 server masquerades as a U.S. flower shop that\u2019s been active since July 2020. The communication between the malware and the C2 server is compressed via GZIP, AES encrypted and BASE64 encoded. The AES key and initialization vector (IV) are hardcoded into this sample: KEY: 3544c085656c997, IV: 4fcff6864c594343.LittleLooter is \u201cfunctionally rich,\u201d researchers said, providing ITG18 operators the ability to pull off this long list of stunts on an infected Android device:Record videoCall a numberRecord live screenUpload/download/delete a fileRecord soundList storage informationRecord voice callGather GPS- or GSM-based locationList device informationShow network activityDeterminate whether screen is on or offShow network speedList installed appsShow network connectivitySend browser historyTurn on/off Wi-FiTurn on/off BluetoothTurn mobile data on/offList contact informationList SIM card informationList SMS inbox/outbox/draftsTake a pictureList calls including received and missed calls\u201cThe LittleLooter sample X-Force analyzed had the version number \u20185\u2019, as well as an update capability if LittleLooter detected it was running a previous version,\u201d Wikoff detailed in a post on Wednesday. \u201cThe tool updates itself by downloading a zip file from a URL on the C2 server: \u2018http[:]//[C2server]/updates/update_[class name].zip\u2019 and replacing the old \u2018classes.dex\u2019 file with the newer version from the zip file.\u201dLittleLooter is a modified version of Android malware reported by third-party researchers several years ago and \u201chas likely been in use by ITG18 for years prior to our association with this threat group,\u201d she said.X-Force expects ITG18 operations to persist despite all the publicity the threat actor has gotten due to its lousy opsec and stolen data, she continued, which speaks to the group\u2019s ability to just keep doing what it\u2019s been doing for so long. \u201cX-Force researchers have high confidence that ITG18 activity will continue regardless of public reporting due to their broad objectives and continued success of their operations,\u201d Wikoff wrote. Her post includes indicators to identify potential malicious activity on networks and mobile devices.Hitting the Jackpot With Discovery of Training VideosBefore the discovery of LittleLooter, \u201cthings like this\u201d began with X-Force\u2019s discovery of the group\u2019s training videos in May 2020. Routine information gathering on the group led to discovery of an open file directory. That directory included files uploaded over the course of a week before the threat actor took them down.It was a gold mine: The open directory included not only exfiltrated victim data but over 4 hours of training videos for new ITG18 operators. Hearing about those training videos was probably \u201cwhat you\u2019re all here for,\u201d Wikoff surmised. As she and Emerson noted in a July blog post, it\u2019s rare to get a behind-the-scenes look at how threat operators behave behind the keyboard, and \u201ceven rarer still are there recordings the operator self-produced showing their operations.\u201dBut that\u2019s exactly what X-Force uncovered: OPSEC failures on the part of an ITG18 operator that provided \u201ca unique behind-the-scenes look into their methods, and potentially, their legwork for a broader operation that is likely underway.\u201dThe fact that Charming Kitten is so efficient at training newbies might mean a few things, Wikoff suggested during the session: It could be that the group has a large staff, and/or it could be that they have a good amount of worker turnover.A Busy and Not-so-Charming KittenWhat we do know: it\u2019s a highly active adversary, with associated groups having targeted genetic, neurology and oncology professionals; medical researchers; Mid-East scholars; and ex-President Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election campaign. They\u2019re notoriously ever-evolving: In October 2019, researchers reported that the actor had added new spearphishing techniques to its arsenal in what appeared to be a ramp-up of operations. Security researchers who tracked the earlier phase of the campaign in October 2018 saw attacks tailored to elude two-factor authentication (2FA) in order to compromise email accounts and to monitor communications.Between August 2020 and May 2021, X-Force has also observed ITG18 successfully compromising multiple victims aligned with the Iranian reformist movement, \u201cProbably to monitor group activity around the Iranian presidential election in June,\u201d Wikoff hypothesized.Due to a basic misconfiguration by suspected ITG18 associates, IBM discovered a server with more than 40 gigabytes of data on the adversary\u2019s operations.iTG18\u2019s training videos were made with a tool called Bandicam: a legit, free screen recorder for Windows. The group also uses Zimbra, a popular, legitimate email and collaboration tool that\u2019s at the heart of communications in over 200,000 businesses, over a thousand government and financial institutions. Every day, Zimbra is used by hundreds of millions of workers to exchange emails containing sensitive information.That makes sense, given the group\u2019s objectives: espionage and surveillance, likely in support of Iranian government objectives. They go after Iranian and what IBM X-Force enumerated as \u201cnear-abroad\u201d dissidents, journalists and academics, along with reformist political party members; COVID researchers; and nuclear and financial regulators.The group frequently leases virtual private servers and registers its own domains. Wikoff said that group operators might be given their own, virtual private server to run operations on, \u201csoup to nuts,\u201d replete with lists of potential targets.The group\u2019s TTPs include phishing via email, social media and SMS; credential harvesting; leveraging compromised accounts; and masquerading as legitimate organizations and individuals. Over the years, they\u2019ve persistently exfiltrated all that data out of Google and Yahoo accounts.Even Adversaries Stumble With CAPTCHAsGoogle and Yahoo are unsurprising targets, but Charming Kitten isn\u2019t fussy: The group gobbles up anything. \u201cWhat we found interesting is that there\u2019s no account too trivial to test credentials for,\u201d Wikoff said, citing food delivery accounts \u2013 e.g., DoorDash \u2013 as one of many examples. \u201cYou name it. If they had a credential for it, they logged in and looked around,\u201d she explained.X-Force researchers also had \u201ca nice chuckle\u201d when they saw ITG18 operators stumbling over CAPTCHAs. \u201cWe all know how fun those are,\u201d Wikoff said. \u201cTo humanize [the operators], we all struggle. We saw him hung up on traffic lights: It took 45 seconds. It\u2019s a nice reminder that threat actors are human, too.\u201dX-Force found a combination of victim-exfiltrated data and tools to get it on the same server.As far as validating credentials goes, it\u2019s \u201cextremely time-consuming,\u201d Wikoff surmised. The group must have \u201ca considerable amount of manpower\u201d behind them to pull it off, she said. The recordings show it all as a manual cut-and-paste slog. The training videos show that the operators stick harvested credentials into Notepad: an easy format for cutting and pasting. Then, they switch between copying a user name, pasting it into Gmail or Yahoo, then switching back to Notepad to do the same with passcodes.But while it sounds like a slog, the operators whip through with alacrity that surprised Wikoff and Emerson. \u201cIt blows both our minds, how quickly the adversary can get into these accounts and set them up for exfiltrating and monitoring,\u201d Wikoff said. Practice makes perfect, though, she remarked: \u201cIt just speaks to how long these adversaries have been doing this.\u201dThe training videos also showed the operators modifying Zimbra collaboration accounts, changing the settings to \u201cless secure access.\u201d Then, they flipped back to the compromised accounts\u2019 inboxes and, when they intercepted the \u201cdid you make this setting change?\u201d alert, they said yup, that was me. The operators next added the compromised email accounts to Zimbra, copying and pasting the email addresses in as account names. They also changed syncing from every 15 minute to 1 minute so they could intercept sensitive data closer to real time.Tracking shows that the group has, over time, exfiltrated at least 2 Terabytes since Fall 2018. The data has included personal information, location details, audio, video, photos, chat logs and SMS messages, and search histories. It\u2019s also compromised social media on top of email accounts.It\u2019s No Laughing Matter: Use MFA or ElseThere\u2019s a bucket-load of schadenfreude to be enjoyed when it comes to adversaries faulty opsec, but this is a serious matter, Wikoff and Emerson stressed. In spite of ITG18 \u2018s continued errors, it\u2019s conducting a big, and often successful, operation that\u2019s going after personal webmail and social media accounts.The two researchers also emphasized the need to train employees. \u201cIn case of IPG18, personal resources are targeted, and employees\u2019 personal computing habits can impact the security of the company,\u201d Wikoff said. That means they\u2019re going after all our info: where we go on vacation, our voice recordings, our conversations with other people. It\u2019s all \u201cripe for social engineering opportunities,\u201d she said \u2013 or for blackmail.Emerson noted that the group tends to first go after targets\u2019 contact lists when first getting access to compromised accounts. \u201cThey\u2019re always looking for the next hotpoint, the next person to go after: often people who are related,\u201d he noted.All the more reason to keep pounding home the importance of multifactor authentication (MFA), Wikoff said. \u201cWe\u2019ll say it til we\u2019re blue in the face: \u2026 vendors have got to emphasize putting MFA on everything. We see this across the board. We can\u2019t drive this point home enough \u2026 to put it lightly.\u201cITG18 is a very serious, prolific group that runs cyberespionage and surveillance. Off of email accounts, cell phones. They have hardly changed their tactics\u201d over the years,\u201d she said.The researchers said that IBM contacted law enforcement about the plethora of compromised accounts that they uncovered. So far, they haven\u2019t detected any reaction from ITG18 in response to the light that IBM\u2019s shed on the group\u2019s opsec glitches: One reason why X-Force feels OK about sprinkling publicity glitter on it all, they said.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 A series of vulnerabilities in internet of things (IoT) devices often found in connected hotel rooms allowed a researcher to take control of multiple rooms\u2019 amenities \u2013 and punish a loud neighbor.An inadvertent bug hunt began when Kya Supa, security consultant at LEXFO, was traveling overseas on vacation. He spent a few nights in a so-called \u201ccapsule hotel,\u201d which refers to accommodations that consist of tiny rooms stacked side-by-side. In an effort to make up for space constraints, these kinds of digs tend to offer a few electronic bells and whistles, and according to Supa, this particular hotel was no different.In a Wednesday session at Black Hat 2021, \u201cHacking a Capsule Hotel \u2013 Ghost in the Bedrooms,\u201d Supa explained that an iPod touch given at check-in allows customers to control their lights, change the position of their adjustable beds and control the ventilation fans.All well and good. Supa wouldn\u2019t have looked under the hood of the technology allowing the room control except for the fact that a noisy neighbor prompted him to see if he could bypass any security protections to take control of other bedrooms in the hotel. It turns out that he was able to do just that using six different exploits that were chained together.\u201cI met my friend \u2018Bob,'\u201d the researcher explained. \u201cThis neighbor woke me up two times during last day. He woke me up because he was making phone calls at 2 a.m. in the morning, and he was speaking really loudly. So, the second night I went to see him and I asked him politely to speak more quietly. He told me \u2018Yeah, sure, no problem.\u2019 But there was no change.\u201dSupa went on to further travels but came back to the same hotel a few days later \u2013 and \u201cBob\u201d was still there, exhibiting the same behavior. So, the researcher decided to do a little pen testing.Taking Stock of the Capsule Hotel Room\u201cThe iPod touch comes with an application that helps to control your bedroom, and it\u2019s connected to devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi,\u201d Supa explained. \u201cSo there must be a way to communicate with whatever is controlling the bedroom.\u201dAn exploration of the bedroom revealed the presence of a Nasnos CS8020 remote, which can be used to control up to five Nasnos devices \u2013 the same ones that the iPod touch connects to. It\u2019s used in case the iPod touch is lost or if the application doesn\u2019t work.He also deduced the presence of a Nasnos CS8700 router within each room\u2019s wall, which enables the control of the Nasnos devices over Wi-Fi, either from the iPhone touch or the remote (and potentially from Android smartphones or other iOS devices).Armed with the knowledge of what the room\u2019s IoT architecture looked like, he moved into the exploitation phase.Exploiting Nasnos Router VulnerabilitiesThe iPod touch in this case has a single application that a hotel visitor is allowed to access, with simple buttons linking to the various \u201csmart room\u201d features.\u201cWhen I first tried to exit the application, I saw that it wasn\u2019t possible,\u201d Supa said. \u201cI cannot exit the application or turn off the iPod touch, but when I triple-tapped on the bottom, I notice that a passcode was asked for. By searching on the internet I found that this behavior was due to an iOS feature called Guided Access.\u201dGuided Access limits a device to specific applications and allows users to control which features are available \u2013 a form of parental controls. It can be overridden with a passcode, but Supa found that the protection is only configured at run time.\u201cThis means the protection is no longer present if we reboot the device,\u201d he explained. \u201cYes, we cannot turn off the iPod\u2026but we can still drain its battery, connect it to power afterwards and reboot the device. Once you do that, the protection is no longer present and we can access everything \u2013 other applications and the iPod touch settings.\u201dIn examining the iPod touch\u2019s device settings, the researcher found that it was enrolled in a mobile device management (MDM) solution, with two saved Wi-Fi networks. One of these was named Nasnos-CS8700, and it was protected using only WEP \u2013 a very old encryption method that\u2019s been crackable for nearly 20 years.In fact, it\u2019s quite easy to retrieve a WEP key, the researcher explained.\u201cYou can return a WEP key by capturing around 80,000 packets [from the access point],\u201d he explained, which he was able to do with a simple JavaScript payload that continuously generates address resolution protocol (ARP) requests. ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on a given network and asks if any of them know they are using that particular IP address. Supa set up a rogue access point (AP) using his Android smartphone, connected the iPod touch to it, cached the payload, connected the iPod touch back to the Nasnos AP and executed the code. Soon he was able to retrieve the key, after which he found that the router was accessible with default credentials.A slide from Supa\u2019s virtual presentation.\u201cThe password starts with 123, and I will let you guess what goes after,\u201d Supa said.He connected his laptop to the vulnerable AP using the credentials in order to set up a man-in-the-middle architecture to inspect traffic flowing from the router. The iPod touch connected to the rogue Android AP, while the Android AP was also connected to a Wi-Fi card in Supa\u2019s laptop. Meanwhile, a second Wi-Fi card in the laptop was connected to the Nasnos AP, and thanks to IP forwarding, the researcher was able to observe that packets were being sent to the Nasnos router on TCP port 8000 with no authentication or encryption necessary.\u201cAfter that, I just developed a program that sends the same packets [from the laptop to the router] depending on the action needed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means we are now able to control the bedroom from a laptop. But can we control all bedrooms?\u201dIn other words, could he mess with \u201cBob?\u201dControlling All Capsule Bedrooms The first thing Supa needed to do was figure out if the Wi-Fi key is generated dynamically or set manually.To find out, he reverse-engineered an application from Nasnos that\u2019s available on Google Play store. It allows users to set up the Wi-Fi configuration of a Nasnos router. In examining the app, Supa came across another vulnerability: Packets are sent to the router on UDP port 988 as part of the remote configuration service, but it doesn\u2019t require authentication for configuring (or reconfiguring) the router.This didn\u2019t reveal whether the keys are static or dynamic, however. But when coming back to the capsule hotel the second time, Supa was assigned a different room.\u201cI noticed a similarity with the Wi-Fi key of my old bedroom \u2013 only the four last characters seemed to change,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is the case across all 119 bedrooms, this will mean there are only 65,536 possibilities, which is nothing\u2026we can launch a dictionary attack with a file containing all the possible keys.\u201dArmed with a list of keys, the next step was matching the correct key to the right SSID for \u201cBob.\u201d\u201cI used my laptop to turn on the light of each SSID\u2019s room, and when I noticed a change in his room, I knew that it was the access point I was looking for,\u201d Supa explained. \u201cI went and tried to imagine the best scenario I could for \u2018Bob.\u2019 A good one would be to create a script that every two words would transform the bed into a sofa and back again, turn on and off the lights and so on. Convince him there are ghosts.\u201dUnpatched Vulnerabilities?In all, Supa found six different bugs:Guided Access bypassUsage of WEPSimple router interface with default credentialsNasnos service available without authenticationRead/write access to remote configuration capability for the routerUse of non-random AP keysSupa said that he contacted both Nasnos and the hotel about the weaknesses.\u201cThe hotel was really cool and took this issue seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now using a new architecture so it\u2019s not possible to exploit vulnerabilities in that hotel anymore.\u201dHowever, Nasnos did not respond to his report, he said, so if non-random keys are used in all of its routers, many other environments are susceptible to similar exploits.Nasnos did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Top U.S. cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs said he expects to be fired by the Trump administration after he delivered a secure presidential election that didn\u2019t go in the current administration\u2019s favor.Krebs, the first and current director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS\u2019s) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), ensured that the 2020 election was not tampered with by nation-state actors and remained secure for all voters, with the DHS calling it \u201cthe most secure in election history\u201d on Thursday.However, Krebs\u2019 efforts to debunk misinformation about the legitimacy of the election angered the president given the fact that his opponent and former Vice President Joe Biden has been projected the winner. President Trump has been insisting that widespread voter fraud occurred during the election and filed lawsuits in a number of states to challenge the results, despite lack of evidence.\n\nBecause of the CISA\u2019s support of a fair election process, the White House is expected to call for Krebs\u2019 resignation, according to a Reuters report, citing sources close to the CISA chief.\u201c[The] government statement about the election being secure should be unremarkable,\u201d tweeted Jonathan Swan, a reporter with news organization Axios. \u201cBut the reality is every person who had a hand in writing it will almost certainly face the wrath of President Trump and his inner circle in the White House.\u201dIndeed, another CISA official\u2014Krebs\u2019 assistant director, Bryan Ware\u2014also has been a casualty of election fallout. He confirmed to Reuters that he was asked to resign earlier this week, a request with which he complied on Thursday.Upon hearing the news, lawmakers and other observers took to Twitter and to praise the job Krebs has done as CISA director, nothing how he put aside partisanship to work for a common goal to protect U.S. cybersecurity infrastructure and the election process. Many also condemned the administration\u2019s decision to fire him.\u201cChris Krebs has done a great job protecting our elections,\u201d tweeted Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.). \u201cHe is one of the few people in this administration respected by everyone on both sides of the aisle. There is no possible justification to remove him from office. None.\u201dMolly McKew, lead writer at Great Power and a writer and lecturer on Russian influence and information warfare, called the White House\u2019 decision to fire Krebs and Ware \u201cpathetic\u201d given the CISA\u2019s success in protecting the election process.\u201cUS officials credited with significant successes in defending our elections from interference, cyberattacks, disinfo are being asked to resign/expect to be fired. Because of course POTUS would rather compromise national security than grow up,\u201d she tweeted.\u201cKrebs has been one of the top and most visible election security officials and has aggressively debunked misinformation in the aftermath,\u201d noted Patrick Howell O\u2019Neill, a cyber reporter at MIT Technology Review, on Twitter. \u201cWidely respected for his work this year.\u201dSecurity experts also chimed in to laud Krebs for the work he\u2019s done since he took on the job as CISA director in June 2018 to protect federal cyber infrastructure and the public from cyber-attack.Chlo\u00e9 Messdaghi, vice president of strategy at Point 3 Security, told Threatpost: \u201cThis last election cycle has been a clear example of why CISA is so important to our national security. The evenhandedness that Christopher Krebs and his team have brought to bear has been invaluable in ensuring election fairness, and in strengthening our threat awareness. CISA confirmed the security of election machines themselves, and highlighted the potential risks of misinformation campaigns by nation state threats.\u201cHe and the team worked closely with other government agencies to bring misinformation threats to the front and let keep us informed on threat actors.\u201dUnder Krebs, the CISA issued regular advisories about key vulnerabilities affecting ubiquitous software used by the administration, ordering departments and agencies to update when necessary to remain secure. The agency also issued warnings when the administration became aware of nation-state-sponsored cyberthreats not only to government infrastructure but also the public as well.\u201cUnder his leadership, CISA pushed forward on informing the country of longstanding vulnerabilities being exploited or exploitable by foreign actors, and which needed immediate patching, both for the security of the election and for ongoing organizational and national security,\u201d Messdaghi added. \u201cThe United States needs the depth of experience or evenhandedness that he and his team have brought to our nation\u2019s cybersecurity.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "Researchers are warning that a new class of botnets could be marshaled and used to manipulate energy markets via zombie armies of power-hungry connected devices such as air conditioners, heaters, dryers and digital thermostats. A coordinated attack could cause an energy stock index to predictably go up or down \u2013 creating an opportunity for a rogue operator to cash in.Researchers with the Georgia Institute of Technology laid out the scenario in a Black Hat 2020 virtual session Wednesday. They warned, high-wattage IoT devices are vulnerable to takeover by threat actors who can hijack them in the same way that millions of CCTV cameras, DVRs and home routers are recruited into botnet armies to conduct distributed denial-of-service attacks and mine cryptocurrency.\u201cIf an attacker can just slightly affect electricity market prices in their favor, it would be like knowing today what\u2019s going to happen in tomorrow\u2019s stock market,\u201d said Tohid Shekari, a graduate research assistant in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology.Shekari was joined by Raheem Beyah, professor, vice president for Interdisciplinary Research, at Georgia Institute of Technology, during the session. They explained that energy markets are split into either a day-ahead or real-time. Energy producers work with resellers who deliver electricity to end users. The ecosystem is ripe for manipulation by threat actors, they said.\u201cTo meet the demand for electrical energy, utility companies must predict future demand and purchase power from the day-ahead wholesale energy market at competitive prices,\u201d according to a Georgia Tech report on the research. \u201cIf the predictions turn out to be wrong, the utilities may have to pay more or less for the energy they need to meet the demands of their customers by participating in the real-time market.\u201dThose real-time markets are more volatile and subject to price fluctuation. \u201cCreating erroneous demand data to manipulate forecasts could be profitable to the suppliers selling energy to meet the unexpected demand, or the retailers or utilities buying cheaper energy from the real-time market,\u201d the report said.Manipulation of this energy ecosystem can also allow a rogue investor to accurately predict a shift in market value and capitalize on ups and downs.During the Black Hat session, Beyah estimated that the number of hijacked IoT devices needed to carry out an attack might be 50,000 within a single market. That would enable what he called an \u201cIoT Skimmer\u201d attack. Using a botnet to increase or decrease power consumption by just 1 percent would be enough to manipulate prices and be extremely hard to detect.Bigger swings in power consumption, researchers pointed out, could also be used to sabotage an energy supplier.\u201cBy turning the compromised equipment on or off to artificially increase or decrease power demand, botnets made up of these energy-consuming devices might help an unscrupulous energy supplier or retailer (electric utility) alter prices to create a business advantage, or give a nation-state a way to remotely harm the economy of another country by causing financial damage to its electricity market,\u201d according to the Georgia Tech report.IoT Skimmer Attacks: HypotheticalWhile the damage wrought by botnets and botnet malware like Mirai, Hydra and BASHLITE is not hypothetical, the IoT Skimmer attacks are. Researchers said they are unaware of any specific attacks designed to manipulate energy markets.Separately, the energy sector is often targeted by way of disruptive attacks. In January, researchers identified the threat actor group APT33, dubbed Magnallium, targeting global oil-and-gas industry and electric companies in North America. Months before that campaign was uncovered, another advanced persistent threat group (APT34), also known as ZeroCleare, was bent on destruction and disruption of the Middle East oil industry.Destructive intent aside, researchers estimate a three-month IoT Skimmer campaign could yield attackers $24 million a year. A malicious IoT Skimmer attack, on the other hand, could cause $350 million per year in economic damage to the U.S. energy sector, the researchers estimated.The Georgia Tech research was based on one year of real-world data analysis of the two largest electricity markets in the U.S. \u2013 New York and California, Shekari and Beyah said.Mitigating against these types of attacks, the researchers said, will take comprehensive monitoring of high-wattage IoT-connected devices and any unexpected spikes or dips in power consumption would need to trigger alarm bells.Please follow all of Threatpost\u2019s Black Hat 2020 coverage by\u00a0clicking here.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "A new \u201czero-click\u201d MacOS exploit chain could allow attackers to deliver malware to MacOS users using a Microsoft Office document with macros. The attack bypasses security measures that both Microsoft and Apple have put in place to protect MacOS users from malicious macros.The exploit chain, revealed by Patrick Wardle, principal security researcher with Jamf, at Black Hat USA 2020, runs macros without an alert or prompt from the Microsoft Office application that prompts explicit user approval \u2013 meaning that when a user opens the document, the macro is automatically executed.\u201cAs the current [macros-based] attacks are lame\u2026 I wanted to make them \u2018better\u2019 to raise awareness about this attack vector, and also highlight how it could easily be worse,\u201d Wardle told Threatpost. \u201cI found a sandbox escape and a bypass of Apple\u2019s new notarization requirements, and combined that with another zero day (from another researcher) to make a full \u2018zero-click\u2019 exploit chain.\u201dWardle notified both Microsoft and Apple about his findings. Apple patched the flaws with the release of MacOS 10.15.3, but told Wardle \u201cthis issue does not qualify for a CVE.\u201d Microsoft meanwhile told Wardle that the exploit chain was an issue \u201con the Apple side.\u201dCurrent Macro-Based AttacksA macro is a snippet of executable code that can be added to Microsoft Office documents, generally used to accomplish a task automatically.\u00a0 However, macros are also commonly abused by cybercriminals, who use them for delivering a malicious payload to the endpoint because they can be allowed with a simple, single mouse-click on the part of the user when prompted.Credit: Patrick WardleMicrosoft has attempted to block macros-based attacks. The tech giant has disabled them in Microsoft Office by default, so a user gets an alert if they are enabling macros. Microsoft also debuted a feature that sandboxed more recent versions of Microsoft Office applications that are running on modern versions of macOS \u2013 so even if (malicious) macros are inadvertently allowed to run, they will find themselves running in a highly restrictive sandbox.From Apple\u2019s end, the company has created notarization checks to prevent potentially malicious code \u2013 downloaded from the internet \u2013 from executing on MacOS systems. Notarizing is an automated system that scans software for malicious content and checks for code-signing issues. \u00a0Due to these current protections, previous macros-based exploits have had little success.However, Wardle\u2019s exploit chain bypassed all of these security protections.Exploit ChainThe first step in Wardle\u2019s chain was a previously-disclosed high-severity vulnerability, CVE-2019-1457, which is a security bypass in Microsoft Office by not enforcing macro settings on an Excel document. The vulnerability results in XML macros that are in the symbolic link (SYLK) file format being automatically executed in Office 11 for Mac. This vulnerability still affects more recent versions of Office for Mac (if users enabled the \u201cdisable all macros without notification\u201d options), the CERT Coordination Center warned last year.Credit: Patrick WardleNext, Wardle leveraged a sandbox escape that was released in mid-2018. This sandbox escape abused a sandbox exception in Office app\u2019s sandbox profile. When it was first released, Microsoft patched the flaw by only denying file creations (deny file-write) in the user\u2019s Application Scripts and LaunchAgents directory.However, \u201cthis means that from the sandbox (e.g. via macro code), we can still create files (ending in ~$something) almost anywhere,\u201d said Wardle.Finally, the exploit chain ended with a full bypass of Apple\u2019s notarization requirements. Wardle was able to do so by abusing the Archive Utility app in MacOS. He used a login item zip archive ~/Library/~payload.zip that was automatically extracted (outside the sandbox) via the Archive Utility.\u201cIf the LaunchAgent directory does not exist (which it does not on a default install of macOS), it will be created, with our launch agent inside it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, we\u2019ve just found a way to create a launch agent, that on the next login will automatically executed by macOS. With an ability to create a launch agent (that will launch an interactive remote shell), it\u2019s game over.\u201dWhat this exploit chain means for an end user is that if they receive a Microsoft Office document and attempt to open it, the executable will automatically run: \u201cTriggered by simply opening a malicious (macro-laced) Office document, no alerts, prompts nor other user interactions were required in order to persistently infect even a fully-patched macOS Catalina system,\u201d Wardle said.More MacOS Macros-Based AttacksWardle warned that macros-based attacks, while traditionally targeting Windows users, have become increasingly more common on MacOS systems.For instance, in 2019 the infamous Lazarus APT group was observed using macro-laden Office documents to target macOS users. In 2017, researchers uncovered a malicious Word document, designed to spread malware on either Mac OS X or Microsoft Windows, depending on where it\u2019s opened.\u201cIn the world of Windows, macro-based Office attacks are well understood (and frankly are rather old news).

        "raw text": "The Mercedes-Benz E-Class went to market riddled with 19 vulnerabilities, which, among other things, could enable attackers to remotely unlock the car door and start its engine. Researchers say the flaws, detailed at Black Hat USA on Thursday, potentially impacted over 2 million Mercedes-Benz connected cars before they were fixed.Click to register!The E\u2013Class is a range of executive cars manufactured by the German automaker, with in-vehicle infotainment systems and various connectivity functionalities. Researchers with the Sky-Go car threat research team, which is part of the security company 360 Group, initially reported the flaws to Mercedes-Benz on Aug. 21 of last year, and an initial fix was deployed on Aug. 26. The researchers have now publicly disclosed the vulnerabilities.\u201cWe reported the flaws to Mercedez-Benz, we found about 19 vulnerabilities,\u201d said Minrui Yan, head of the Sky-Go Team with 360 Group, presenting with Jiahao Li, researcher with 360 Group, at Black Hat. \u201cThe key impact is that we can send a \u2018remote services\u2019 commands to the car. We did see many security considerations in the Mercedes-Benz.\u201dConnected Car\u00a0Features\u00a0Various security holes were discovered throughout the connectivity functionality architecture of the Mercedes-Benzes.The first part of this architecture is the \u201cHead-Unit,\u201d or the infotainment system. Researchers specifically looked at the infotainment system in the Mercedes-Benz E300L model, code-named NTG-55 and designed by Mitsubishi Electronics. The system features multimedia functions and also connects to the \u201cMercedes Me\u201d mobile application. This app allows users to monitor their vehicles in detail, including remotely starting, or locking and unlocking, their vehicle \u2014 or even noting how much fuel is in the tank. Researchers found one flaw in the Head-Unit, which has not yet been assigned a CVE.Meanwhile, a critical communication intermediary between the external network and the in-vehicle network in the car is a Telematics Control Unit (TCU) called HERMES, which is short for Hardware for Enhanced Remote-, Mobility- & Emergency Services. Its functionalities include the ability to make emergency calls and informational calls, and support for remote diagnosis, local diagnosis, and more. But, it also contains a communication module that supports 3G and 4G networks, and can be set up with a short-range wireless network (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) for the infotainment system. Researchers found six of the 19 flaws in the HERMES component (including CVE-2019-19556, CVE-2019-19560, CVE-2019-19562, CVE-2019-19557, CVE-2019-19561 and CVE-2019-19563).Other flaws existed in the backend of the vehicle (nine flaws; eight of which had no CVE assigned and the ninth tied to CVE-2019-19558) and the operations system of the car (two flaws without CVEs assigned). Of note, in order to protect the intellectual property of Mercedes-Benz automaker Daimler, researchers disclosed limited security designs and code details.The ImpactIn order to send remote-services commands, researchers probed the HERMES TCU system of the car, which they say is the most crucial component in the whole system, since it features the communication module that connects the in-vehicle infotainment network and the external network and Mercedes Me app.In order to further inspect HERMES, researchers needed physical access to the system since the firmware wasn\u2019t available on a vendor site or by proxying traffic. They physically opened the NAND flash storage containing the firmware using a ball-grid array (BGA) Rework Station with a socket that they made themselves.Researchers then found that they were able to \u201ctamper with the file system by adding an interactive shell with root privileges. We found an engineer-mode program for debugging the TCU system, with access to the CAN bus via operating the MCU [a chip-level microcontroller],\u201d said researchers. \u201cThus, we can perform some operations for example, lock or unlock the doors.\u201dResearchers also found various other issues. For instance, TCU file systems stored the \u201cpkcs12\u201d client certificates, passwords and CA certificates for the car\u2019s back-end server \u2013 and researchers were able to sniff out the encrypted password files for certificates, which had a suffix \u201c.passwd.\u201d\u201cThe key of the certificate is encrypted to a file, so we can get the certificate key by compiling the decrypting tool with OpenSSL, obtaining the password of the certificate key. After decryption, the passwords of client certificate \u2026 can be obtained,\u201d they said.Researchers also found a server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw on the back-end surface of the car\u2019s infotainment system, in a feature of the complementary web application that allows users to add their social-media accounts to the system: \u201cAn SSRF vulnerability occurred in the back-end service, as the image provider failed to filter the parameters we input,\u201d they explained. \u201cThe plugin developers have less consideration of the requested URL. For example, if we submit a local URL to the image provider, it\u2019ll return the contents we requested. \u201dAside from remote lock and start, the researchers have not been able to access any safety-critical functions of the vehicle, they said during their session. Guy Harpak, head of Product Security for Mercedes-Benz R&D, said Mercedes-Benz took several incident response (IR) steps after learning of the vulnerabilities. These include selectively blocking services and providing immediate fixes; launching forensic investigations and deploying more long-term fixes.\u201cWe have an example here of a strong research community working with a strong industry can bring better security,\u201d Harpak said during the session.As they become more connected, more and more vehicles are facing security holes. Previous researchers have discovered flaws in car infotainment systems, as well as the wares of specific automakers like Volkswagen, Jeep and more.Check out Threatpost\u2019s live Black Hat USA 2020 coverage, including news interviews, threat research updates and more, here.

        "raw text": "Social media used as a cudgel for nation-states to sway opinion is a cybersecurity threat CISOs can\u2019t ignore \u2014 and need to understand better and mitigate against.That\u2019s the message from Ren\u00e9e DiResta, research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, who said she is seeing a steady growth and maturing of damaging social-media campaigns by nation-states. The use of social media to sway opinion, sow division and hurt reputations is now part of a threat-actor\u2019s playbook, according DiResta. During a keynote address at Black Hat on Thursday entitled \u201cHacking Public Opinion,\u201d she said threat actors are fine-tuning these attacks.Click to register!Her message to the Black Hat community is that these types of attacks can just as easily be delivered as \u201creputation attacks\u201d against businesses as they can against elections.\u201cWhere does this threat land in your org chart? It falls to the CISO,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a cybersecurity issue\u2026we need to do more red-teaming around social and think of it as a system and how attacks can impact operations.\u201dShe noted that recent reputation attacks leveraging a social-media playbook have included the agrochemical firm Monstanto Company, petroleum producers involved in fracking, and business and organizations that have taken strong stances on social issues. Too often, DiResta said, there is a lack of ownership of the problem inside companies.In her talk, DiResta walked virtual attendees through what constitutes a modern social-media influence campaign. First there is the creation of thousands of fake-personae accounts. Then there\u2019s the development of content, which is seeded to social platforms. Next, dubious news sites generate plausible \u2014 yet bogus \u2014 articles that amplify a core message. If successful, the viral nature of the \u201cnews\u201d piques the interest of mass-media news sites. They take the bait and report on the viral \u201cnews\u201d as fact.\u201cAs people in the infosec community, you need to identify the kill chain here and understand how to stop these attacks,\u201d she said.She outlined how both China and Russian nation-state actors have created influence operations to fit what she calls the \u201cthe information environment\u201d of the day. The goal is to distract, persuade, entrench and divide.\u201cThe secret with social isn\u2019t ad buys and fake personas. It\u2019s people becoming the unwitting participants in these influence campaigns by spreading their messages for them,\u201d she said.She drew a sharp distinction between China and Russian state actors. To wit: She pointed out that efforts to sway public opinion on the Hong Kong riots and attempts by China to deflect blame for the spread of the coronavirus were a failure.While the number of fake social-media accounts created by China state actors was staggering, campaigns lacked the emotional component needed to spark organic human-to-human sharing of memes, stories or opinions. Stanford Internet Observatory estimated that 92 percent of the hundreds of thousands of fake accounts tied to China-influence campaigns had less than 10 followers, she said.Russia-linked APT Fancy Bear on the other hand has been extremely successful in leveraging social platforms via a sophisticated mix of tactics that include hacking, leaking sensitive information and infiltrating impassioned affinity groups.The hack-and-leak strategy begins with a compromise of a high-profile individual or organization. Damning information is then disclosed. Next, a social campaign amplifies the compromising information. Quasi-news sites report on the information leaked \u2014 and not the hack. Eventually, mainstream media picks up the report.This virtuous circle of propaganda is accelerated by social platforms that are optimized for content-curation, meme-sharing and generating threaded discussions. Add to the mix the abuse by hackers of algorithms used by social platforms to maximize member engagement, DiResta said, and you have a \u201cfull-spectrum information operations.\u201dThe antidote is heightened awareness of how these systems are abused by social platforms, consumers and victims. That includes CISOs and the cybersecurity research community, who should view these campaigns the same way malware or business-email compromises are reverse-engineered and mitigated against.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "Satellite internet communications are susceptible to eavesdropping and signal interception by far-flung attackers located in a different continent or country from their victims. And all they need is $300 worth of off-the-shelf equipment to pull it off.That\u2019s the word from James Pavur, an academic researcher and doctoral candidate at Oxford University, speaking at Black Hat 2020 on Wednesday.Satellite ISPs provide connectivity in places where terrestrial communications aren\u2019t possible. For instance, at oil rigs in the Gulf, or to pilots in-flight. Commercial shipping vessels, fishing boats, cruise passengers, terrestrial explorers camping in the wilderness, Arctic observation camps, weather stations and others all rely on satellite to connect to the outside world.Click to register!The first thing to know is that the way satellite communications work provides for a wide geographical attack area, the researcher explained. When a satellite ISP makes an internet connection for a customer, it beams that customer\u2019s signals up to a satellite in geostationary orbit within a narrow communications channel; that signal is then sent back down to a terrestrial receiving hub and routed to the internet. However, when the response signals are sent back along the same path (just in reverse), that transmission downlink between the satellite and the user will be a broadcast transmission, containing many customers\u2019 traffic simultaneously.\u201cA critical difference is that we\u2019re going to send [downstream signals] in a really wide beam, because we want to cover as many customers as possible, and satellites are very expensive,\u201d according to Pavur. \u201cSo radio waves carrying a response to a Google search will reach our customer in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean; but they will also hit an attacker\u2019s dish in, say, Ghana.\u201dEssentially what this means is that if they were able to perform an interception, adversaries could eavesdrop on vast sections of the globe.The $300 Listening StationThe common assumption is that for an attacker to pull off this kind of signal interception, it takes money. And indeed, there are specialized modems for intelligence-collection purposes that allow governments to listen in on satellite communications, Pavur noted; they\u2019re installed in multimillion-dollar ground stations worldwide. However, for those without nation-state assistance, the researcher demonstrated that the same kind of attack can be accomplished with basic home-television consumer equipment.\u201cWe purchased this simple flat panel satellite dish \u2014 although honestly any satellite dish would do, even something that\u2019s already resting on your roof, or off of Craigslist or Gumtree for basically free,\u201d Pavur said. \u201cAnd then we used a PCIe satellite tuner card. These are widely available for people who want to watch satellite television on their computer.\u201dHigher-end professional PCIe tuner cards cost between $200 and $300, but there are cheaper versions in the $50 to $80 price range. The downside of the cheaper ones, Pavur explained, is that there will be a lack of reliability in listening in on certain feeds.With the equipment in hand, eavesdroppers then need to decide where to point their dishes (the locations of comms satellites are public information), and then go about discovering internet feeds. To do that, Pavur\u2019s team used a software tool called EPS Pro, which is designed to help people find satellite television channels.\u201cWe\u2019re going to point our satellite dish at a spot in the sky that we know has a satellite, and we\u2019re going to scan the Ku band of the radio spectrum to find signals against the background noise,\u201d Pavur explained. \u201cThe way we\u2019ll identify channels is by looking for distinct humps in the radio spectrum; because they stick out against the background noise, we can guess that there\u2019s something going on there. We\u2019ll tell our card tune to this one, and treat it as a digital video broadcasting for satellite feed. After a few seconds we get a lock on that feed, meaning we successfully found a connected satellite.\u201dThe next step is to make a short recording of the feed; depending on the signal-to-noise ratio, the amount of data captured could range from a megabyte to a terabyte. In any event, attackers would then examine the data to discover whether they\u2019ve found internet traffic or a TV feed.\u201cThere\u2019s no dark magic to this process, I\u2019m just going to look through that raw binary file for the string HTTP, which we\u2019d expect to see an internet capture, but wouldn\u2019t expect to see in a television feed,\u201d Pavur explained.Once an internet connection is identified, it\u2019s possible to record it and then parse it for information. But there\u2019s one other obstacle to this process, according to the research. The feed might be transmitted in one of two protocols: The MPEG video streaming format (which is easy to parse using commonly available tools like Wireshark), or a newer protocol known as generic stream encapsulation (GSE).\u201cGSE is much simpler in theory; it takes an IP payload and wraps it in a generic GSE stream which has a bunch of different fragments, and then puts that into a digital video broadcasting feed,\u201d explained the researcher. \u201cThis is particularly popular we found among enterprise customers, who rent an entire satellite transponder for their networks. But, the signals they send have more complicated modulations that are hard for cheap hardware to keep up with.\u201dAs a result, the team found they were often losing big chunks of these types of GSE internet feeds, resulting in corrupted files. There was a fix however: they wrote a forensic tool called GC Extract that can reconstruct meaningful IP data out of a corrupted GSE recording \u2013 problem solved.Encryption IssuesThe Oxford team took their set-up and applied it to real satellite internet connections, finding that generally speaking, the satellite ISPs they examined did not seem to be employing encryption by default. As a result, they were able to listen in on feeds from a wide range of victim types, on land, at sea and in the air \u2013 as if they were the ISP themselves.\u201cWhat this means is that an attacker who\u2019s listening to your satellite signal gets to see what your internet service provider would expect to see: Every packet that comes to your modem, every BitTorrent you download, every website you visit,\u201d Pavur said. \u201cBut it gets even worse if we look at enterprise customers, because a lot of them were operating what was essentially a corporate land network over the satellite feeds. For example, imagine a cruise line that has a bunch of Windows devices aboard it ships. This Windows local area network with all that internal LDAP traffic and SDP traffic will be broadcast over the satellite link, giving an eavesdropper perspective from behind the firewall.\u201dEven users whose own traffic is encrypted are susceptible, Pavur explained.\u201cOur ISP vantage point gives us some unique perspectives on what you\u2019re doing \u2013 for example, your DNS queries are likely still sent unencrypted, so we can piece together your internet browsing history, and which websites you\u2019re visiting,\u201d the analyst noted. \u201cEven those TLS certificates which are protecting the contents of your traffic are also fingerprinting the servers you\u2019re talking to, and the services you\u2019re connecting to.\u201dVictim ImpactPavur also offered a few examples of what the team was able to pick up. For instance, they intercepted an email conversation that a lawyer in Spain was having with a client, about an upcoming court case.\u201cNow, obviously, this raises serious concerns for attorney client privilege and personal communications privacy,\u201d said the researcher. \u201cBut in our threat model, it gets even worse, because at this point, we have access to the contents of this email inbox, we know his email address. So we can say hey, this guy goes to paypal.com, and we can also go to PayPal and use the \u2018forgot my password\u2019 function to steal his PayPal account or any other account.\u201dIn another example, the team found that many wind turbines use satellite, and that they have connected terminals with a control panel for changing the settings of the power station.\u201cThe credentials for these were often being sent in clear text over the satellite link, meaning that anyone on the internet could see that and start messing around with electricity infrastructure,\u201d Pavur said. \u201cThere may be a second layer of protection behind this login page that we didn\u2019t account for, but it\u2019s at least intuitively concerning that these credentials are being broadcast in clear text.\u201dIn a maritime use case, the eavesdropping picked up multiple terabytes of information from ships, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear which packets were coming from which vessel.\u201cSo we picked 100 random IP addresses and devised a basic fingerprint consisting of DNS queries, TLS certificates and some strings from the first couple of bytes of their traffic, to see if we could actually de-anonymize these IP addresses and tie them to specific ships in the ocean,\u201d Pavur explained, adding that they were successful for about 10 percent of the vessels the team looked at.One was a fishing boat that was using software to tell it where fish could be found, over the satellite feed, while another was a massive container ship, \u201cone of the larger ships in the world for one of the largest shipping companies in the world.\u201dOther successful targets for interception included a subsea repair ship, operated by a major petroleum company, which had a vulnerable box running Windows Server 2003; a port authority transmitting cargo-ship lists of all crew members, dates of birth and passport numbers, in clear text; and communications from a Greek billionaire\u2019s yacht.In the case of the vulnerable server, Pavur cautioned that this could be a pathway to attacking the operational technology on board the ship.As for the latter, \u201cone day, his captain forgot his Microsoft account login,\u201d Pavur said. \u201cAnd so the account-reset password was sent over clear text on the satellite feed. At this point, we had a route where we could have potentially hijacked this captain\u2019s account and targeted an extremely high net-worth individual via targeted social-engineering attacks.\u201dNotification and MitigationThe Oxford team disclosed their findings to all impacted entities, both the test victims and ISPs \u2013 but won\u2019t be \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d anyone.\u201cWe don\u2019t want this to be a report about X cruise line leaking your personal information; we want to talk about a systemic issue that affects almost every customer of satellite geostationary broadband,\u201d said Pavur. \u201cWe of course responsibly disclose these vulnerabilities, reaching out to some companies as much as a year ago, as well as the customers who are most affected by these breaches. Generally people were pretty receptive.\u201dThe Federal Bureau of Investigation also released a private threat-intelligence notification in response to the research.On the mitigation front, the response is more complicated than simply adding encryption. Users that employ standard end-to-end encryption will find themselves taking a big performance hit, according to the research.\u201cIt turns out that traffic is really slow over those satellite feeds because of all the hops you have to make in the sky,\u201d Pavur explained. \u201cAnd so as a result, satellite internet service providers have built a tool called a performance-enhancing proxy, which is essentially a benevolent man-in-the-middle that intercepts and modifies your TCP sessions on both sides of the satellite link to make it feel fast. Unfortunately, if you use standard end to end encryption, this will stop the ISP from being able to engage in that benevolent man-in-the-middle attack, and it will slow your satellite speeds to a crawl.\u201dAn alternative is to use a TLS-encrypted email client which would eliminate the performance difference, but would protected at least email-related communications. And also, ISPs could improve on their end, with encryption or tweaks that disallow traffic to be parsed.The takeaway, according to Pavur, is that internet users should always remember that the next hop is unknown.\u201cThe internet is a weird web with devices and systems that are connected in ways that you can never predict, you might connect to a secure Wi-Fi hotspot or a cell tower, but the next hop could be a satellite link or wiretapped Ethernet cable,\u201d Pavur cautioned. \u201cHaving the right, the ability and the knowledge to encrypt your own data, and to choose to do that, is critical to protecting against this class of attack, whatever domain you think about it in.\u201dComplimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "Voting machine-maker Election Systems & Software (ES&S) has formally announced a vulnerability disclosure policy, Wednesday, during a Black Hat USA 2020 session.The move, which comes with the U.S. presidential elections looming in November, shows that voting-machine vendors are beginning to take the role of the security research community seriously in helping to secure critical election infrastructure. On Wednesday, ES&S said that its formally released policy applies to all digital assets owned and operated by ES&S \u2013 including corporate IT networks and public-facing websites.\u201cWe\u2019re publishing this policy today to formalize how we\u2019re going to work with security researchers to improve election security going forward,\u201d said Chris Wlaschin, vice president of Systems Security and CISO, ES&S. \u201cThis is a good first step in the right direction and we look forward to improving, everywhere we can, election security.\u201dThe policy does not give authorization to test state and local government election-related networks or assets \u2013 \u201cresearchers should follow guidance from those entities for security researcher opportunities and conditions,\u201d according to the report.\u201cFor ES&S products not owned or operated by ES&S, we will accept reports as a result of research under this policy,\u201d the company said.The vulnerability-disclosure policy also provides safe-harbor language for security researchers. This means that ES&S will not initiative legal action against researchers for \u201cgood faith\u201d or accidental violations of the policy. In addition, researchers will be exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and ES&S said it will not bring a claim against them for circumvention of technology controls.Finally, researchers would be \u201cexempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy,\u201d according to the policy.The adoption of safe-harbor language marks a drastic turnaround from how the voting-machine vendor has interacted with the research community in previous years.At DEFCON in 2018\u00a0for instance, ES&S and security researchers butted heads after the company criticized attempts to test voting machines. In a letter to customers, ahead of the conference, ES&S in 2018 also warned election officials that unauthorized use of its software violated the company\u2019s licensing agreements.Despite this contentious background, security flaws have popped up over the years in the company\u2019s election infrastructure. In 2019, security researchers revealed that they found 35 backend election systems \u2013 made by ES&S \u2013 that connected to the internet at some point in the past year.\u00a0And in 2018,\u00a0the company revealed\u00a0that it installed remote-access software on some voting machines over a period of six years, raising security concerns.The announcement also comes during a year when election security is in the spotlight at Black Hat, with the U.S. elections three months away. \u00a0Security researcher Matt Blaze opened Black Hat 2020 with a call-to-arms for cybersecurity researchers, asking the security space to leverage their expertise to help secure the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which will likely be a mostly vote-by-mail affair.Wlaschin for his part said that ES&S has actually been working now with security researchers for at least 18 months \u2013 but the program announced on Wednesday formalizes the process. As part of this, ES&S has worked with Synack, a crowdsourced penetration testing platform, to continue to develop its vulnerability disclosure process.\u201cIf you apply [vulnerability disclosure] to our election critical infrastructure, there is a match made in heaven here between security companies and government bodies, and we\u2019re trying to advance that collaboration,\u201d said Mark Kuhr, CTO of Synack.Check out Threatpost\u2019s live Black Hat USA 2020 coverage, including news interviews, threat research\u00a0updates and more, here. \u00a0Black HatCritical InfrastructureVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A newcomer on the ransomware scene has coopted a 14-year-old malware variant to help it maintain persistence on a targeted network in a recent attack, researchers have found.Black Basta, a ransomware group that emerged in April, leveraged Qbot, (a.k.a. Quakbot), to move laterally on a compromised network, researchers from security consulting firm NCC Group wrote in a blog post published this week. Researchers also observed in detail how Black Basta operates.\u201cQakbot was the primary method utilized by the threat actor to maintain their presence on the network,\u201d NCC Group\u2019s Ross Inman and Peter Gurney wrote in the post.Qbot emerged in 2008 as a Windows-based info-stealing trojan capable of keylogging, exfiltrating cookies, and lifting online banking details and other credentials. Since then it has stood the test of time through constant evolution, morphing into sophisticated malware with clever detection-evasion and context-aware delivery tactics, as well as phishing capabilities that include e-mail hijacking, among others.Black Basta is, in contrast, a relative baby when it comes to cyber-criminality. The first reports of an attack by the ransomware group occurred only a few months ago.Black Basta, like many others of its kind, uses uses double-extortion attacks in which data is first exfiltrated from the network before the ransomware is deployed. The group then threatens to leak the data on a Tor site that it uses exclusively for this purpose.Qbot in the MixIt\u2019s not unusual for ransomware groups to leverage Qbot in the initial compromise of a network. However, Black Basta\u2019s use of it appears to be unique, researchers said.\u201cThe seriousness and efficiency of the collaboration cannot be underestimated,\u201d observed Garret Grajek, CEO of security firm YouAttest, who said in an email to Threatpost that the finding also ups the ante in terms of how organizations must protect themselves.NCC Group discovered the attack when they noticed a text file in the C:\\Windows\\ folder named pc_list.txt that was present on two compromised domain controllers, they said.\u201cBoth contained a list of internal IP addresses of all the systems on the network,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThis was to supply the threat actor with a list of IP addresses to target when deploying the ransomware.\u201dOnce the ransomware group gained access to the network and created a PsExec.exe in the C:\\Windows\\folder, it used Qbot remotely to create a temporary service on a target host, which was configured to to execute a Qakbot DLL using regsvr32.exe, researchers wrote.To proceed with lateral movement, Black Basta then used RDP along with the deployment of a batch file called rdp.bat\u2013which contained command lines to enable RDP logons. This allowed the threat actor to establish remote desktop sessions on compromised hosts, which occurred even if RDP was disabled originally, researchers said.Evasion Tactics and Ransomware ExecutionResearchers managed to observe specific characteristics of a Black Basta attack in their investigation of the incident, including how it evades detection as well as executes ransomware on the compromised system, they said.The group commences nefarious activity on a network even before it deploys ransomware by establishing RDP sessions to Hyper-V servers, modifying configurations for the Veeam backup jobs and deleting the backups of the hosted virtual machines, researchers said. It then uses WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to push out ransomware, they said.During the attack, two specific steps also were taken as evasion tactics to prevent detection and disable Windows Defender. One was to deploy the batch script d.bat locally on compromised hosts and execute PowerShell commands, while another involved creating a GPO (Group Policy Object) on a compromised Domain Controller. The latter would push out changes to the Windows Registry of domain-joined hosts to slip through protections, researchers said.Once it\u2019s deployed, Black Basta ransomware itself, like many ransomware variants, doesn\u2019t encrypt the entire file, researchers found. Instead, it \u201conly partially encrypts the file to increase the speed and efficiency of encryption,\u201d by encrypting 64-byte blocks of a file interspaced by 128-bytes, they wrote.To modify files, the group also uses an earlier-generated RSA encrypted key and 0x00020000, which are appended to the end of the file to be used later for decryption purposes, researchers said. Following successful encryption of a file, its extension is changed to .basta, which automatically adjusts its icon to the earlier drop icon file, they added.Malware",

        "raw text": "Black Friday cyber-pariahs have revamped gift-card scams to better target modern online shoppers hungry for deals post-Thanksgiving. Experts warn new tactics include bogus gift-card generators that install malware designed to sniff out a victim\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet address.Internet-based Black Friday and Cyber Monday scams have become as common as the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade. That\u2019s why scammers save to trot out new ways to snare cyber-savvy shoppers. In a Tuesday-post, researchers at Malwarebytes Labs, outlined this year\u2019s latest gift-card scams. One novel twist includes offering gift cards for significantly less than face value as a ploy to entice users to buy stolen gift-cards or download malware.\u201cIf you see websites offering all kinds of discounts on gift cards, you can be assured that these will turn out to be fakes or they have been acquired in an illegal way and you could be acting as a fence,\u201d wrote Pieter Artnz, Malwarebytes malware intelligence researcher.Generating Scams, Not Gift CardsResearchers said they have been tracking a number of websites that claim to provide \u201cgift card generators\u201d that people can use to generate the code for all kinds of gift cards. These sites can be particularly deceptive because they use major brands such as Amazon, Roblox, Google, Xbox and PS5.The \u201clucky\u201d people who fall victim to these scams will download gift-card generators and be informed just before trying to use them that they don\u2019t actually generate valid gift-card codes, but only \u201crandom codes for \u2018educational purposes,'\u201d Artnz wrote. Likely this occurs after people fill out surveys and give up personal information.However, these scams can get much more sinister, with the process to obtain a gift-card generator actually downloading malware to someone\u2019s system, researchers said.Artnz described one such scam that used a gift-card generator to steal cryptocurrency from victims using a file titled \u201cAmazon Gift Tool.exe\u201d that was being marketed on a publicly available file repository site as a free Amazon gift card generator.\u201cIn reality, the malware watched a user\u2019s clipboard to find text that matches the normal length of a certain type of cryptocurrency wallet address,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf other criteria were met, to ensure that the victim was involved in a Bitcoin Cash transfer, the malware replaced the string on the clipboard with the attacker\u2019s Bitcoin Cash wallet address.\u201dThe scam depends on the victim not noticing that his or her crypto wallet address is on the clipboard when pasting it during the transaction, they noted. If successful, the transfer goes to the cybercriminal instead of the intended recipient.Choose a Better GiftTo avoid falling prey to these and other cybercriminal scams on Black Friday this year, people have a few options. They can choose to be more creative in their choice of presents, keeping in mind that many gift cards end up going unspent, Artnz wrote.Indeed, according to a Juy 2021 survey by Bankrate, 51 percent of U.S. adults currently have unused gift cards, vouchers or store credits totaling roughly $15 billion in outstanding value.Moreover, slightly less than that, 49 percent, of U.S. adults have lost a gift card, voucher or store credit at some point.If people do decide to use Black Friday to shop for gift cards online, they can keep one simple rule in mind to avoid being defrauded, Artnz said.\u201cIt always helps to keep in mind that if something sounds too good to be true, it is probably not true at all,\u201d he wrote.Cybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "Security researcher Matt Blaze opened Black Hat 2020 with a call-to-arms for cybersecurity experts, asking them during his keynote to leverage their passion for election security to help secure the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which will likely be a mostly vote-by-mail affair.\u201cThis community is precisely the one whose help is going to be needed by your local election officials,\u201d he said. \u201cThe logistical aspects of this are familiar to computing specialists,\u201d he said, while urging virtual Black Hat attendees to \u201cengage now.\u201dScaling up mail-in voting, Blaze said, with less than 100 days left before the election, is an undertaking that, while not impossible, presents many challenges. With the \u201coperational environment being under uncertainty and in a state of emergency\u2026our expertise in this community is central to many of the problems that we have here.\u201d\nBlaze, who is McDevitt Chair in Computer Science and Law at Georgetown, chairman of the Tor Project and co-creator of the Voting Village at DEFCON, took the virtual \u201cstage\u201d at Black Hat 2020 on Wednesday for the first-day keynote. He discussed how the global coronavirus pandemic has created a national emergency on the voting front, driving a need for scaling up accessible, COVID-19-safe election mechanisms between now and November. Broader mail-in voting is an obvious choice for that \u2013 but making it or any other \u201cfix\u201d a reality in the short-term is easier said than done, he said.\u201cI\u2019m a computer scientist who studies computer security, which is full of terribly hard problems,\u201d Blaze said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever encountered a problem that\u2019s harder than the security and integrity of civil elections \u2013 it\u2019s fundamentally orders-of-magnitude more difficult and more complex than almost anything else.\u201dOne of the big reasons for this complexity is the fact that the federal government has remarkably little to do in practice with the process and the mechanisms of voting, he said, making for a patchwork of approaches that can\u2019t be effectively changed in bulk.Click to enlarge.\u201cIn practice, each state sets its own rules, has its own laws, and has its own requirements for the elections that are conducted in that state,\u201d Blaze explained. \u201cAnd in most states, elections are actually run by local governments, most often counties. And to give you a sense of the scale, there, there are over 3,000 counties in the United States \u2013 and if you add the townships and other governments that that run elections, there are over 5,000 government entities responsible for doing everything with the elections for their residents. So there\u2019s no single place where you can change everything nationwide.\u201dWith the pandemic and various politicians driving controversy over the efficacy of vote-by-mail, Blaze noted that absentee voting has always been with us \u2013 but just not at scale.\u201cThis is available everywhere, and it\u2019s a fairly predictable, well-established concept in general, and election officials can usually predict how many people are going to need to vote by this absentee method,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are states that that rely on mailing voting very heavily, in places like Oregon. But that said, in most places, we still by and large vote in person.\u201dThe ratio of in-person-to-absentee will almost certainly change in November, thanks to COVID-19, Blaze added.\u201cWe have an increase in the number of voters who are unable to vote in person, and maybe an increase in the number of local administrators who can\u2019t operate all of their normal polling places,\u201d he said. \u201cSo people may not be able to vote in their normal way, in much larger numbers than previously anticipated. We might have an increase in the number of people who are displaced, and have to vote from someplace else. Maybe they\u2019re in a hospital, maybe they\u2019re quarantined somewhere. Maybe they\u2019re at a different location while they wait out the pandemic, or what have you.\u201dClick to enlarge.The good news is that the user experience for absentee ballots is fairly straightforward: A voter requests a ballot, marks it anonymously and puts it in an envelope. That envelope is then placed in a second envelope, which has identifying information and which is signed for voter roll purposes, and mailed off.Delivery capacity at the U.S. Postal Service aside, the mail-in voting workflow inside a given election office, while solidly established and secure, is where potential issues begin to creep in when trying to expand in volume, according to Blaze.\u201cWhen the voter requests the ballot, they have to be removed from the in-person poll book and sent a ballot package,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s received back, the signature has to be checked against the signature on file, and if it\u2019s a match, the inner envelope is sent off for batch scanning, without the voter\u2019s identity\u2026the machines that do this batch scanning are big and expensive. These are not off-the-shelf components, rather, these are basically industrial machines.\u201dAll of this leads to problems in scaling up. It may be necessary to add additional scanners for instance, and those machines themselves have to be audited regularly. There\u2019s also plenty of pressure on the chain of custody for the unmarked absentee ballots themselves. Additionally, if the signature on a marked ballot doesn\u2019t match the signature on file, an exception-handling process kicks in that can be quite labor-intensive, because the election worker will need to follow up with the voter directly. And, to top it all off, basic materiel logistics can become a problem at volume.\u201cSending the ballots out to the voters who need them, and processing the marked ballots, are both very human-intensive processes that often involve checks by multiple people, and it has to be done properly or the integrity of the election can get called into question,\u201d Blaze noted. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re going to do this on a larger scale, not only do you need to provide for all of this work that has to be done by human beings, over a pretty short time, but you also have to worry about things like how many ballots and envelopes do you have? You can\u2019t just go to your local Kinkos or FedEx Office and print new ballots, because ballots have security features involving infrared reflective and infrared opaque inks.\u201dAll of this, combined with the uncertainty about how many voters will need mail-in ballots and the fact that most jurisdictions do not currently have the funding, expertise or personnel to operate at scale, represents significant challenges.Blaze added, \u201cwe\u2019re likely not to know [exactly what\u2019s needed] until it\u2019s too late to change course. And that means we need to prepare for a very wide range of scenarios that may or may not come to fruition. So we may need to print lots of ballots that we don\u2019t end up using, and also provide for lots of in-person voting that might not end up being used under pandemic conditions.\u201dIs there another path instead of scaling mail-in voting or accepting that millions may be disenfranchised if in-person is the only available method to cast a ballot?Blaze\u2019s answer to that is that deploying secure online voting systems is not a practical reality in the time we have until the election. So, the only alternative would be to postpone the contest until absentee voting at scale can be fully staffed and vetted. Blaze noted that there are scattered precedents for instituting a delay \u2013 after 9/11 in 2001 for instance, a primary election for mayor in New York City had to be postponed. However, postponing a national election, even for an emergency like COVID-19, is \u201ckind of the worst-case option,\u201d Blaze said, for many reasons. Not the least of which is because it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s even constitutionally possible, and it could lead to court proceedings and social unrest (consider, Blaze noted, what happened in the wake of election-results delays and Bush v. Gore in 2000).\u201cIt\u2019s obviously very highly disruptive for certain elections, and we don\u2019t really know what the rules are, because they haven\u2019t been tested before,\u201d he noted. \u201cThere are questions like, if we\u2019re not able to hold the presidential election on time, does the current Speaker of the House become acting president? We hope to not find out the answers to questions like that.\u201dPlease follow all of Threatpost\u2019s Black Hat 2020 coverage by clicking here.Black HatCritical InfrastructureGovernmentVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "An abundance of deep-learning and open-source technologies are making it easy for cybercriminals to generate fake images, text and audio called \u201csynthetic media\u201d. This type of media can be easily leveraged on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to launch disinformation campaigns with hijacked identities.At a Wednesday session at Black Hat USA 2020, researchers with FireEye demonstrated how freely-available, open-source tools \u2013 which offer pre-trained natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition tools \u2013 can be used to create malicious the synthetic media.Synthetic media includes fake videos, voices and images that can be used in various malicious cases. For instance, cybercriminals can use generative text to forge legitimate-looking spearphishing emails. And at a bigger scale, this fake media can be used to create more malicious content, such as \u201cfake porn\u201d videos weaponized to harass targeted women. In other cases, synthetic media can be used to sway public opinion, like a wide-scale disinformation campaigns using phony, but recognizable, personas.\u201cFine tuning for generative impersonation in the text, image, and audio domains can be performed by nonexperts\u2026 [and] can be weaponized for offensive social media-driven information operations,\u201d said Philip Tully, staff data scientist at FireEye, and Lee Foster, senior manager of information operations analysis at FireEye during a Wednesday session.Low Barrier to EntryThe world is currently facing the \u201ccalm before the storm\u201d when it comes to the malicious use of synthetic media, Tully warned.For one, social media has also \u201cgreased the wheels\u201d for this type of synthetic content to actually have a malicious impact, said Tully. Social media companies often do not require high bars of credibility, and offer a platform for content to go viral, allowing anyone to create fake media that is believable.Secondly, the technology for creating synthetic media is becoming cheaper, easier, more pervasive and more credible \u2013 \u201cdrastically reducing the amount of time that it takes to make this happen,\u201d he said.\u00a0One such concept lowering the barrier to entry is called \u201ctransfer learning.\u201d Previously, researchers using deep learning models to create fake content had to train two different data models. But in transfer learning, neural network models learn one task, and then the learning from that first task is used to fine tune the second task.This concept has paved the way to a \u201crich open source model ecosystem,\u201d said Tully.\u00a0While these open-source models have many advantages \u2013 including for research and detection against malicious AI bots \u2013 they are also leading to real-world, malicious, fake content found on social media platforms.Click to Expand.For instance, FireEye researchers uncovered a widespread influence campaign that impersonated and fabricated U.S. politicians and journalists on social media \u2013 with pro-Iranian interests (the campaign led to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter taking action against over 40 accounts). \u00a0In another instance, Foster said, networks of inauthentic social media accounts were discovered amplifying political narratives, such as pro-China networks targeting protestors in Hong Kong and pushing COVID-19 pandemic narratives.Black Hat DemonstrationResearchers demonstrated various open-source models that are providing both good and bad actors with the means to create synthetic media content. For instance, for the creation of fake images they pointed to the style-based GAN architecture (StyleGAN), which allows data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. The GAN architecture consists of a \u201cmapper\u201d stage, which embeds inputs as visual features; a \u201cgenerator\u201d that synthesizes image from scratch, and a \u201cdiscriminator,\u201d which predicts whether real images and generated images are real or fake.Credit: FireEyeResearchers demonstrated voice cloning with SV2TTS, a three-stage deep learning framework enabling them to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it for fake output. At a technical level, this starts with the input of a dataset into a \u201cspeaker encoder,\u201d which embeds a speaker\u2019s utterance. In the second phase, a text-to-speech platform called Tacotron2 generates a spectrogram from text that is conditioned on these utterances; and finally, a tool called WaveRNN model infers audio waveform from these spectrograms. Voice impersonation is another top threat that cybercriminals are focusing on \u2013 with a voice \u201cdeep fake\u201d last year swindling one company out of $243,000.Researchers finally demonstrated the generation of \u201csynthetic text,\u201d which can be achieved by fine-tuning the open source language model known as GPT-2. GPT-2 is an open source deep neural network that was trained in an unsupervised manner on the causal\u00a0language modeling task. The model is trained so it can predict the next word in a sentence accurately \u2013 and ultimately form full sentences.Researchers said, a bad actor could put an \u201cinput\u201d of open source social media posts from the\u00a0Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA),\u00a0which they describe as a social media \u201ctroll factory.\u201d This input would then create fine-tuned text generations as an output, which can then be posted by troll accounts as part of disinformation campaigns online \u2013 such as \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that our military has to be in Iraq and Syria.\u201dThe Future of \u2018Synthetic Media\u2019There are various technical mitigations that protect against deepfakes. These include machine learning-based forgery detection, which may include looking at eye alignment, teeth abnormalities, ear asymmetry, no blinking, and other factors in multi-media content.Social media platforms can also adopt content authentication measures, such as verifying accounts or moderating content for fact-checking. Facebook, Microsoft and a number of universities\u00a0have meanwhile joined forces to sponsor a contest promoting research and development to combat deepfakes. And, Google and other tech firms\u00a0have released\u00a0a dataset containing thousands of deepfake videos to aid researchers looking for detection techniques.However, the \u201cdetection, attribution, and response is challenging in scenarios where actors can anonymously generate and distribute credible fake content using proprietary training datasets,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cWe as a community can and should help AI researchers, policy makers, and other stakeholders mitigate the harmful use of open source models.\u201dCheck out Threatpost\u2019s live Black Hat USA 2020 coverage, including news interviews, threat research\u00a0updates and more, here. \u00a0Black HatPrivacy",

        "raw text": "A stack of Linux backdoor malware used for espionage, compiled dynamically and customizable to specific targets, is being used as a shared resource by five different Chinese-language APT groups, according to researchers.According to an analysis from BlackBerry released at Black Hat 2020 on Wednesday, those five groups have turned out to all be splinters of the Winnti Group. Active since at least 2011, Winnti is known for high-profile supply-chain attacks against the software industry, with the aim of spreading trojanized software (such as CCleaner, ASUS LiveUpdate and multiple malicious video games).The Linux toolset uncovered by BlackBerry was used in a series of targeted attacks. It contains six different pieces, according to Kevin Livelli, director of threat intelligence at the firm. Speaking during a Wednesday session, he noted that the tools start with an installer bash script, compressed inside of another shell script, whose job it is to work with a remote build server. That build server, which is the second item in the bundle, custom-compiles a malware package for a specific target on the fly, which would then be downloaded to the victim by the installer.This custom malware payload consists of items three and four: A rootkit and a backdoor, complete with an installation script for the target. As for the rootkit, BlackBerry researchers found two variants, both designed to work with an associated backdoor.\u201cWe saw them tailored for different kernel versions, with up-to-date command-and-control (C2), so we knew older kernel versions were still in use \u2013 likely a reflection of the fact that many Linux sysadmins are too slow to update for various reasons,\u201d Livelli said. \u201cWe found examples of malware that targeted Red Hat Enterprise, CentOS and Debian, but it\u2019s a good bet, given their custom nature, and on-the-fly combination, that there are others out there.\u201dThe fifth item is an attacker control panel, capable of managing both Windows and Linux targets simultaneously, with its own graphical user interface, Livelli said. And finally, the sixth item is the Linux XOR DDoS botnet, which is the largest known Linux botnet, first coming to notice in 2015.As far as C2 activity, Livelli said that BlackBerry observed hard-coded network callback data inside the attacked organization it investigated, which suggests that the group had already established infrastructure inside the target before deploying the Linux stack.\u201cIt\u2019s highly likely that all the Linux malware that we found was not first-stage malware, but rather a persistence tool, a beachhead, if you would, and that the compromise of the targets ran much deeper and was much more well established,\u201d Livelli said. \u201cWe also saw extensive abuse of legitimate cloud provider infrastructure [for C2].\u201dIn addition to the C2 infrastructure and the Linux stack, it\u2019s worth noting that other malware also infested the systems observed.\u201cState-backed attackers almost always target multiple platforms,\u201d Livelli said. \u201cThis time, we found some of the same group of attackers in command of some Android malware, and others wielding some Windows malware. We found an excellent vantage point on an entire malware suite and good evidence of a cross-platform approach to espionage.\u201dThat type of undertaking is not for the under-resourced, he added.\u201cThe attackers took a lot of time to set this up, establish a foothold in the target, devise a way to quickly compile sophisticated malware for multiple combinations of Linux distributions and kernel versions, and then install it,\u201d Livelli said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of love, tension and development time, plus testing and refinement. And on top of that you\u2019ve got to take care of the kids, go grocery shopping and walk the dog and you know, there\u2019s COVID-19 social-distancing to do.\u201dAfter Livelli\u2019s session, Kaspersky told Threatpost that the series of attacks were focused against various companies from the semi-conductor industry in Taiwan. The firm\u2019s analysis showed that the attackers used CobaltStrike, a commercial implant, in their operations. Kaspersky also determined that the \u201clegitimate cloud provider\u201d mentioned that was used for C2 communications was in fact the Google Cloud platform (this makes the network traffic look legitimate and raises major issues when trying to block, according to the firm). And post-exploitation, they employed a new tool called SkeletonKeyInjector, which appears to be derived from both Mimikatz and Dumpert (two open-source projects).Linux for StealthFurther investigation also showed that the Linux malware set has likely been in the wild for nearly a decade. One reason for its longevity, Livelli said, is because Linux tends to fly under the radar when it comes to those holding the cyber-defense purse strings in any organization.\u201cThink for a minute about the people who sign the paychecks or make the big decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cHow often does the word \u2018Linux\u2019 enter their conversations. Second, for those of us who\u2019ve had the opportunity to work for vendors, how [deep] are the offerings for Linux compared to the offerings for Mac and Windows. I\u2019m willing to wager that in general, security industry support of the myriad Linux distro and kernel combinations out there pales in comparison to the support given to Windows. It\u2019s just economics, you supply the engineering and marketing and sales effort behind the platform that creates the most demand.\u201dAs a consequence of that reality, Linux malware can slip through the cracks \u2013 while giving cybercriminals deep access to sensitive information.\u201cOur conclusion was that the targeting of these Linux servers was strategic in nature,\u201d Livelli said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell anybody in this audience why the always-on, always-available nature of Linux makes it a great beachhead. How often do you take your web server or your database server offline? Is it somewhere in the neighborhood of never?\u201dHe added that Linux-run servers constitute a deep bench of critical infrastructure within the government agencies and businesses that make up modern society.\u201cLinux runs not just web servers and database servers, but also proxy servers, file servers, VPN servers, \u00a0stock exchange servers, it\u2019s embedded in IoT, it\u2019s embedded in network appliances, it\u2019s embedded in cars,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have to point out to this audience that Linux-run web servers are perfect for hiding massive amounts of exfiltrated data.\u201dHence, APT interest in Linux is not a completely unknown quantity. According to Livelli, \u201cLinux malware in the hands of government-backed groups has been written about before \u2013 Kaspersky Lab has documented its use by the Russian Turla and American Equation Group, and among the Chinese groups we\u2019ve seen Linux malware research on Deep Panda and APT41\u2026[including by] our colleagues at Chronicle. The point here is that we should be watching for this kind of thing.\u201dAll Trails Lead to WinntiThe five individual groups found using the Linux stack were linked to Winnti and to each other in some way, Livelli noted.For instance, \u201cwe followed a C2 trail for [one of the groups] and found some domain crossover, which led to our sample, a file that had the string called \u2018wavedancer,'\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd as we took it apart, parsing some XML strings coughed up some other C2 information, which led to dual domains, which led to a domain that was registered by the same email address as had been used in lots of other PassCV work we\u2019ve been following.\u201dAlso, each of the groups employed a familiar Winnti technique. \u201cStudents of Winnti know that one of their hallmarks is the use of code-signing certificates, stolen from video-game companies and [more recently] certs taken from adware companies,\u201d the researcher said.\u201d[This] is probably the easiest common denominator to identify across these groups.\u201dLivelli believes that \u201cWinnti\u201d as a handle is actually an umbrella term that may describe shared resources rather than act as a moniker for any single APT crew. He said that he believes it\u2019s probably a group of civilian contractors whose assembled tools are shared and that the targets are split up. Alternatively, it could be that the Chinese government is offering various groups levels of tools and support\u2014an arrangement that FireEye called a \u201cdigital quartermaster\u201d model.\u201cWhether these groups are actively collaborating, casually sharing, if they comprise some of the same members, or in actuality are smaller parts of some larger group, it\u2019s beyond our means of analysis,\u201d Livelli said. \u201cBut one thing is clear: This isn\u2019t a single crew, with a one trick pony. We are looking at a long-standing, well-thought-out, richly resourced intelligence collection operation, with a sizable software engineering team to build and maintain all these tools.\u201d\u00a0Please follow all of Threatpost\u2019s Black Hat 2020 coverage by\u00a0clicking here.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "Critical flaws in the popular Meetup platform were revealed Monday as part of research unleashed at this week\u2019s Black Hat USA 2020. The flaws, which have been patched, enable the full takeover of Meetup \u201cGroups\u201d by threat actors, who can also redirects payments and carryout other malicious actions.Erez Yalon, the director of security research with Checkmarx, discussed why these critical vulnerabilities are a \u201choly grail\u201d for attackers, and explained how the bugs are indicative of overall application security trends that will be discussed this week at Black Hat USA 2020. In the case of the Meetup flaws, the researcher identified two. One is a cross site scripting flaw and the second a cross site request forgery \u2013 both tied to the platform\u2019s application programming interface (API).Below is an interview with Yalon conducted ahead of the research along with an accompanying transcript.\u00a0Listen to the full interview below or at this link.Below find a lightly edited transcript of the interview.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch: This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch with Threatpost and I am joined today by Erez Yalon, the director of security research with Checkmarx. And we\u2019re talking during Black Hat USA 2020, where Checkmarx is announcing some new security research that they came out with. So Erez thank you so much for joining me today. It\u2019s nice to be talking to you even though this year, it\u2019s actually virtually instead of our in person interviews that we\u2019ve done in the past.Erez Yalon: Yeah, we usually do face to face but this is not allowed in the new normal. So this is how we do it now. But it\u2019s fine.LO: There\u2019s always Black Hat 2021. Now, during Black Hat 2020 Checkmarx\u2019s security research team has some new research that you are releasing, and that is specifically focused around Meetup.com. And for those who don\u2019t know, Meetup.com is a popular website that allows users to create an event for people, with similar interests to gather, so you know, book clubs or dog walking clubs, for instance. So Erez you found an array of kind of security issues in the investigations that you did \u2013 everything from API security issues to cross-site scripting and cross site request forgery flaws, can you kind of give us a rundown of the research and you know, what these different vulnerabilities were?EY: Sure. Okay, so basically looking at Meetup.com, we\u2019re not targeting specifically them.\u00a0We\u2019re in general, looking at the websites that are high in demand and more interesting for everyone, for consumers and us as well. So Meetup was one in a long list. Now, it was part of our research about API security, which we invest a lot in these days. But actually the biggest issues we found were just good old application security issues.I think that they are probably among the top five famous vulnerabilities that can be found in appsec, application security. One of them is the cross site scripting flaw. And the other one is the cross site request forgery, also known as XSS and CSRF.When we started playing with Meetup, we found that one of their features or endpoints is not totally sanitizing \u2013 and by sanitizing I mean, removing bad inputs \u2013 not totally sanitizing the fields that are in the discussion field. Now, every Meetup group has a discussion board under the group. And it\u2019s, as far as I know, enabled by default. We didn\u2019t see any groups without it, I think it makes sense to allow discussions in the group.And the sanitization process there was not complete. And we managed to bypass it by adding some specific scripts and tags that bypassed the protection of the Meetup website. What it was is what we call stored XSS. Now, instead of a message or a discussion or a post on the page, we could have put some benign message actually in the background on a script. So this by itself is very bad already, because it means that in the context of a web browser, we can do whatever we want, now for every person who visits this discussion board, so it can be stealing information that is part of your web browsing process like cookies and sessions, and things like that. We can deface the website or even do some cryptomining on the web browser. So this, this actually lets us do many, many things. The interesting part was that we thought, okay, if it\u2019s a stored XSS, it means that that the organizers will probably fall into this hole as well as the XSS. So they might run some sort of script on their side, and we know that they have admin capabilities. So the next vulnerability we found was cross-site request forgery, CSRF, which means that essentially when the user is authenticated on the server, it means that if I have hold of the client side, which I do with XSS, I can run a lot of commands in the name of that user, and the user will not even be able to tell that the web browser actually sent these commands.So just before I talk about specifically what we did here, I want to mention that the combination of XSS and CSRF is the holy grail for us, because when you manage to chain these two together, sometimes there are no limits to what can actually happen. So riding on the XSS will propel specific, malicious script that runs on the organizers\u2019 side, on the organizers\u2019 browser. And then by abusing the CSRF we\u2019ve caused the organizer to give permissions of a co-organizer to the attacker. So suddenly, we\u2019ve taken over the account completely and we have access to a lot of information \u2013 \u00a0we can change the Meetup, we can cancel it, we can create a fake meetup, etc. So this actually was some sort of privilege escalation we created. And because we\u2019ll never \u00a0be happy and we always want more. To top it all, we found a way also to, to play a bit with the payment details. So with Meetup you have a lot of options of collecting payments, sometimes it\u2019s just $1 or two for refreshments from each one and sometimes it\u2019s a paid session like $100 or $200. And we were able to \u2013 like we did\u00a0 with the privilege escalation I described we could actually redirect the payment to our own PayPal address. So our scene, when we imagined it, is an attacker changing all the payments of Meetup for like 24 hours, gathering all the all the money and running away. This is the scenario we imagined. And I think it was interesting \u2013 we did not try that \u2013 but as a as a theory, we could actually create a wall that would infect each user and each user would infect all the Meetup groups they are part of, etc., going on and on like that. This way we could have also reached private groups and groups that are not listed on Meetup. So all in all, it\u2019s kind of a critical issue, as you can understand.LO: For sure, I mean, that impact there of being able to redirect all payments to a PayPal account seems like it would definitely be a lucrative one for cyber criminals who are definitely motivated by money. \u00a0So that could be a serious impact there. In terms of exploitability for these vulnerabilities. How serious are they? What would an attacker potentially need to, you know, carry out an actual attack here?EY: So the field that was not sanitized well, it was partially sanitized. So I believe that automatic hacking tools or testing tools that check for this would not find it, but we tend to be creative. So when we find something that seems not completely protected, we will find a crack together, so it was more of a manual thing than an automatic thing. But I think that every hacker that would have decided to do that would eventually probably find a way in. And as soon as you find the XSS, and then the next thing you do is to look for the CSRF, because as I said, they go together to reach the higher purpose of really doing some damage there.LO: Yeah. And what was the process of disclosure here? Because you guys reach out to meet up and I believe they have fixed everything. Is that correct?EY: Yeah, we never publish anything without getting confirmation from the vendor that they fixed everything. And the reason is that we don\u2019t want to put the users in any unnecessary risk obviously. So we reached out to Meetup. They fixed things, they talked to us, we helped them through the fix cycle. Trying to direct them to the right way to do that. And just recently, they got back to us and informed us that everything they meant to fix is fixed. And that\u2019s it. So now we\u2019re free to discuss that.LO: Great well, definitely some interesting research there. And now we have Black Hat this week, and what are some of kind of the top threats you expect to be discussed at the conference this year? And, I mean, they might be related to COVID and the ongoing pandemic or election security. I mean, those are kind of the top ones I\u2019m expecting to see, but is there anything from your standpoint, having been observing what\u2019s been going on in the threat landscape over the past few months that you\u2019re really expecting to hear more about?EY:\u00a0 Yeah, so I think the trends would definitely dictate election security. And maybe also COVID, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s been enough time to actually create some sort of presentation that will tell us a lot about that. I think it will be interesting to wait a bit into the future and see what happened. Although I\u2019m sure there are some people who can already discuss that. Another trend we can probably expect to see is 5G, all the talks around that, some of them targeting the actual technology, some of them the hype and the scared people around it. Regarding more technical aspects, I think that we saw a big trend of moving towards API security in the past, we will probably see the bigger picture now. Everything that is what we call cloud-native, from containers to serverless to again, API security. And everything that is about this new architecture that is no longer a buzzword, it\u2019s actually what we see every day. And this is where modern architectural software is going. Obviously, it has a lot of pluses and a lot of things that makes everything simpler to us. But security sometimes as we know, drags behind. So this is a good time to close the gap and make sure that security is also moving forward in the same piece of architecture and our cutting edge technology.LO: And to your point about 5G I certainly think that\u2019ll be a big topic as well, just with everything, starting to be rolled out and a lot of hype there over the past year or so. And I also wanted to ask you, I mean, you know, you\u2019ve been up in charge of the AppSec village in previous Black Hats. What can we expect there for this year, especially with everything being virtual?EY: \u00a0Yeah, so AppSec village is part of DEF CON not Black Hat. And we started it last year. It was the first year it was great success we had during DEF CON, which is directly after Black Hat, almost 5,000 visitors in our AppSec village, which is like a mini conference inside of a conference, which is talking mainly about application security, obviously. This year DEF CON moved to or what they call safe mode, which is simply going virtual and we pivoted towards that as well. We\u2019re not sure in the beginning because none of us had the experience of creating and virtual conference before. But we heard the community and everyone demanded to have another AppSec village this year. So we decided we were going to do that, together with my colleagues, friends and co leaders. We managed to get a group of volunteers and got a lot of support from DEF CON themselves. And it\u2019s going to be virtual everything is going to be through Discord with some recorded talk, some live talks, we\u2019re going to actually try to do workshops, virtually, it\u2019s going to be kind of challenging, but I think that people who are coming to DEF CON, are really anxious and really want to get their hands dirty, in a way. And we\u2019re going to have a nice competition of the Capture the Flag around the application security teams, and we\u2019re going to meet a lot of people it\u2019s going to be very, very interesting trying to make this new normal, somehow normal.LO: Right, yeah, well, I you know, I\u2019m excited to see how that plays out. And I\u2019m sure that the interest is definitely there and there will be a lot of cool things coming out of that, so, Erez, thank you so much for coming on to talk a little bit more about your new research and what to expect over the next week.EY: My pleasure.LO: Great, and to all of our listeners.

        "raw text": "Despite COVID-19 pushing the Black Hat USA 2020 conference to go virtual for the first time, you can expect a steady stream of new security research, threat intel and an impressive lineup of high-profile speakers.This year\u2019s conference kicks off with Matt Blaze, McDevitt Chair in Computer Science and Law at Georgetown University, who is slated to talk about election security measures. Earlier this week, Blaze put President Donald Trump in the Twitter spotlight blasting him in a high-profile tweet for spreading \u201cbaseless\u201d election concerns. Election security is also on the mind of Christopher Krebs, director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s CISA unit, whose Black Hat session is called \u201cElection Security: Securing America\u2019s Elections.\u201dCOVID-19 and remote work will also be a theme at the conference, with Ren\u00e9e DiResta, research manager at Stanford Internet Observatory giving a keynote (\u201cHacking Public Opinion\u201d) on online disinformation about coronavirus and nation states spinning pandemic conspiracies. Beyond that, you can look out for advancements in research around some of the typical hot topics unveiled at Black Hat USA, including Apple research by Patrick Wardle, vulnerabilities found in connected cars (this year a Mercedes-Benz), critical infrastructure weaknesses and even \u201csatellite eavesdropping attacks.\u201dThreatpost editors Tom Spring, Tara Seals and Lindsey O\u2019Donnell-Welch break down the top sessions, keynotes, speakers and themes to look out for in this week\u2019s podcast.Download the podcast direct here or listen below.Below find a lightly edited transcript of the podcast.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch:\u00a0Welcome back to the Threatpost podcast, Black Hat USA 2020 preview edition. You\u2019ve got the Threatpost team here, including myself, Lindsey O\u2019Donnell-Welch, Tom Spring and Tara Seals. And we are planning on breaking down what to expect from the first ever virtual Black Hat Conference in the entire 23 years of the show, which kicks off this weekend. So Tom and Tara, how are you doing? Are you excited for the show?Tom Spring:\u00a0Well, yeah, I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m excited that I don\u2019t have to hop on a plane and fly to Vegas. I mean, there\u2019s there\u2019s pluses and minuses.Tara Seals: I am, I\u2019m definitely excited about not being in Vegas in August. So that\u2019s a good thing. Yeah, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how that how the virtual event is going to go. It looks like the session list has pretty impactful content, lots of interesting stuff and tendrils to pick up on in there, in terms of trends.Lindsey: Yeah, it\u2019ll be interesting, it being virtual, in previous years of the show, obviously, you go for the keynotes and the sessions and the breaking news. And that will still all be there. But it\u2019s also always fun to meet, you know, face to face with security experts who you\u2019ve mostly been interacting with on the phone for all of the year. So I\u2019ll really miss that this year. But I do see that they have Tara, as you say, tons of sessions and really interesting \u2013 I think it was over 90 research presentations that\u2019ll be prepared and presented this year. So, you know, in terms of topics, I mean, this probably comes to a surprise to no one but obviously election security is going to be a huge topic this year just looking at the keynotes and the sessions as well.Tara: Yeah, for sure. And I think that, obviously it being an election year, it\u2019s near and dear to everyone\u2019s hearts and is at the top of everyone\u2019s minds how this election is going to go. So it\u2019ll be interesting to see from a cybersecurity perspective what it is that they\u2019re going to be zeroing in on. And, you know, at past events we\u2019ve had a lot of talk about the voting machines themselves. But I think this year, the focus might be more on online voting and mail-in ballots and more the hacking of processes rather than the actual machines. That would be interesting.Tom: Yeah, the second day keynote in terms of election manipulation in terms of social media, there\u2019s going to be a focus on that as well. I think one of the other dominant themes that can\u2019t be avoided, even though it\u2019s not explicitly stated in the sessions, is going to be remote work, with everybody working from home. I don\u2019t know if it was deliberate or not, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be too much discussion about the pandemic and about how workforces are working from home. But it does seem like there\u2019s enough stuff about VPN security, cloud security, cloud exploits, container security, where we\u2019re going to see that, is also another dominant theme.Tara: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of interesting that you mentioned the cloud, Tom, because there are a ton of cloud-related sessions this year. And I know the guys from Mandiant are going to be talking about an O365-targeted series of attacks that I think you\u2019re going to be attending, right?Tom: Yeah, yeah, I\u2019m\u00a0actually really interested to see how it\u2019s gonna play out in terms of what the what the actual experience is going to be like from a \u2013 nevermind a reporter standpoint \u2013 but just as a sort of an attendee standpoint. Whether or not it\u2019s just going to be like an empty room with somebody at a podium or, you know, somebody sitting at their desk. I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see what happens. But yes, so I\u2019m really looking forward to covering the cloud security issues. There\u2019s seems to be at a much smaller scale, a lot of news percolating up right now, in anticipation of some of the bigger sort of\u00a0sessions that are going to be taking place\u00a0primarily on Wednesday and Thursday, as the first half of the conference is dedicated to training.Lindsey: Right. Yeah. And there\u2019s definitely a ton of sessions that we\u2019ve seen in previous Black Hats that are, you know, we\u2019ve seen the speakers there, like Patrick Wardle would be talking about how on MacOS certain attacks are growing in popularity, and I know he\u2019s done a ton of presentations in previous years, so I\u2019ll be looking forward to that one. There\u2019ll be a really cool, connected car security research on Mercedes-Benz session that I\u2019m interested in. I know, it\u2019s not presented by Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, necessarily, but there is always really cool car security research that comes out of Black Hat. So I\u2019ll definitely be focused on that one by I think it was researchers with 360 Group. And then just beyond that, I feel like, a focus on critical infrastructure and IoT. Tara, I know, yesterday, you wrote about those VPN flaws that were affecting OT networks. And I think that really will be a big focus this year at Black Hat in terms of security issues in critical infrastructure. And I know that I think I saw that like Trend Micro will highlight some work done in terms of research, finding weaknesses in industrial protocol gateways, in industrial control system environments. So just something to look out for there. I know that OT networks and OT security was a big topic at Black Hat 2019. So I think that will just continue this year.Tara: Yeah, I think the focus on critical infrastructure of late \u2014 we\u2019ve seen a bit of a groundswell in that area. And you know, you\u2019re talking about some of the cool sessions that that you had spotted on the agenda, Lindsey, I know Tom, one of the ones that you have been talking about was the IoT Skimmer session from the researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Talking about using a botnet to conduct power-market manipulation, which is really, really interesting. And new and different.Tom: Yeah, no, that sounds like a really fascinating\u00a0session, looking forward to actually sitting in and reporting on what comes out of that. This whole virtual Black Hat, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. You know, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how I mean how the vendors deal with communicating their messages outside of the Black Hat in a sense that you know, so much about Black Hat wasn\u2019t actually about the sessions, but some of the off-site stuff and some of the meet and greets and some of the private briefings. You know, as this plays out, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how it all falls into place or if it falls into place. I am cautiously optimistic that it\u2019s going to be a good\u00a0hopefully great, Black Hat, you know?Tara:\u00a0Yeah, I would really love to see if they\u2019re able to carry out some sort of virtual networking agenda. And I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t seen a whole lot, I\u2019ve been getting some reach-out from different individual firms, but in terms of a virtual reception or something like that, and I don\u2019t even know what that would necessarily look like, but I think if any virtual conference could crack the code on how to enable networking in a virtual type of setting, I think that would be a real winner.Tom: Yeah, and Tara helped me better understand, I know this is\u00a0Black Hat. But DEFCON is sort of the other conference that is such an important part of my Black Hat Las Vegas experience and, and help me help me and remind me what the plan of action is DEF CON, in terms of how they\u2019re going to structure that event that usually overlaps and, and really is that you know, sort of for me the icing on the cake in terms of security coverage of the show.Tara: Yeah, so DEFCON is going to kick off on August 7 and continue through August 8, so directly after Black Hat that is going to start. And they\u2019re taking a very different approach from what I can tell, in that they don\u2019t actually have a set agenda necessarily. They\u2019re trying to get people to interact on forums and different messaging boards and trying to get people together in sort of clusters or pods to discuss different interesting topics of the day. And so I think that\u2019s going to be a lot more informal and I think it\u2019s gonna be a lot more interactive and about bouncing ideas off of each other and much closer to sort of the typical networking experience than you would see at traditional conferences. Which is honestly what DEFCON in its physical format was like anyway. But it seems as though they\u2019re really eschewing the set session schedule in favor of more of a get-the-brain-trust together and see what comes out of it approach.Lindsey: Right. Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting. And I know too, that DEFCON always has their Voting Village. So I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to how that\u2019s going to play out this year, being virtual, but I am, you know, especially with election security being such a big focus this year, I am really interested in kind of how that\u2019s gonna play out and what\u2019s going to come out of that. And I was also talking to your Erez Yalon with Checkmarx, who heads up the AppSec village at DEFCON, and he said that they are moving forward with that in a virtual format this year. And that, you know, that should be, you know, really interesting as well in terms of how, how they\u2019re going to kind of move forward with that, too. So I think that DEFCON will still have a lot of really interesting features and news coming out of it and just discussion. Should be cool.Tara: Yeah, I agree. And I think we can just sort of monitor that and then leap in to bring all the news to our our readers, which would be good. I just wanted to highlight one session that I\u2019m super-excited about. It\u2019s on satellite eavesdropping attacks, and a guy from Oxford University is going to be presenting this, it kind of fits in with the \u00a0industrial theme because they\u2019re going to be talking about being able to hack satellite communications protocols that are used in things like wind farms, oil tankers, aircraft, things like that, and what the threats could be against real-world systems, and hacking those protocols. So that\u2019s gonna be kind of fun to cover.Lindsey: Yeah I always find those are fascinating. I think those kinds of sessions are really where Black Hat and RSA and some of the other big conferences really stand out in that those types of research are just so cool.Tara: Definitely.Lindsey:\u00a0Yeah. One other session to that I want to highlight as well. And this goes back to the whole election security. But I did see that Chris Krebs, who\u2019s the Director of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s CISA unit, we\u2019ll also be talking about election security. So, you know, we\u2019re obviously getting the election security talk from the keynote speaker, Matt Blaze, but I think it\u2019ll be really interesting to hear what Chris Krebs has to say and kind of being in the trenches a little bit and all this and really, what\u2019s going to happen there. So I really think that\u2019s going to get a lot of focus during the show as well. And then one other election session that stuck out to me was, there\u2019s a session by someone from Systems Security and someone from Synack, who are talking about building a vulnerability disclosure program that works for election vendors and hackers. And I think that\u2019ll be a cool twist on the entire election security narrative, because it\u2019s really bringing in the research community into the channel of communication a bit there and how that\u2019s going to evolve and what the security research industry, like what kind of role they have to play with election security coming up right around the corner.Tara: That\u2019s kind of fascinating because if you think about it, all of that equipment is very proprietary and they keep everything really close to the vest in order to maintain an OpSec type of environment around it. So if they invite hackers to come in and start poking around and pen-testing these things, I\u2019m wondering to what extent these platforms are going to be open. It\u2019s much like when Apple said that they were going to be providing iPhones for hackers to take a crack at \u2014 but you know, they\u2019re not completely open. I wonder to what extent are these machines going to be thrown open to for pen-testing?Tom: Yeah, well, you know, baby steps, \u00a0you got to keep in mind that, you know, these bug bounty programs have been around, they feel like they\u2019ve been around for quite some time, but I think that still a lot of people are just adopting them and understanding them and figuring out how to really get the most out of them in terms of value, in terms of feedback. And also, you know, what we always hear is, you know, the cost associated with launching these programs is not insignificant. So, so yeah, it\u2019ll be interesting, but I\u2019m also really interested to know, we\u2019ve had voting villages and huge warning signs around election security. It\u2019ll be really interesting to me, as we go real time with the elections this November, whether or not we see a heightened awareness and heightened security around elections \u2013 another story for another podcast \u2013 but I hope that all these sessions and awareness and security is not all for naught.Lindsey: Right? Wasn\u2019t that in 2018 at DEFCON when the 11 year old hacked into the replica voting website at DEFCON\u2019s voting village? Right? So I mean, that goes to show there\u2019s just so much there that needs still, you know needs to be done but it is always really cool to kind of see that being played out at Black Hat and DEFCON so something to keep our eyes on for sure.Well, Tom and Tara I\u2019m excited for the show next week and thanks for coming on to talk about you know, the most interesting sessions and keynotes and themes that we should be on the lookout for.Tara: Thanks so much, Lindsey.Lindsey: Great and to all of our listeners we will be live at virtual show next week. And so be sure to continually check Threatpost.com, we\u2019ll have live coverage coming out on all these keynotes and sessions that we\u2019ve talked about here today.

        "raw text": "Cybersecurity conferences Black Hat USA and DEF CON 28 will not be held in person this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The conferences will both instead be transformed into completely virtualized events.Both back-to-back annual conferences were set to take place in Las Vegas this year; Black Hat USA on Aug. 1 to 6, 2020, and DEF CON 28 on Aug. 7 to 9, 2020. The virtual versions of the events will still take place during those same days.\u201cWe have been continuously reviewing the best ways to serve the information security community over the past few months as the global health situation continues to develop,\u201d according to Black Hat general manager Steve Wylie in a Friday update. \u201cWhile we will not be meeting in person, we are moving forward with a plan to transform Black Hat USA into an all-virtual event in order to best serve our community.\u201dWylie said that Black Hat USA will be adapted into a virtual format that will be available for the entire global infosec community. More details on how the virtual conference will be set up will follow, he said.For the virtual version of Black Hat USA, there will be no changes to processing for\u00a0talks, workshops, demo labs, and training CFPs submissions (and the CFP has already closed), a Black Hat spokesperson told Threatpost. More details will be announced next week.\u201cOur team is working hard to deliver the same level of high-quality Briefings, Training and Business Hall programs that Black Hat attendees have come to expect every year,\u201d Wylie said.Announcement: Black Hat USA 2020, August 1-6, will be an exclusively virtual event. We look forward to bringing our global community together in a new and unique way.

        "raw text": "VMware has fixed an uber-severe bug in its Carbon Black App Control (AppC) management server: A server whose job is to lock down critical systems and servers so they don\u2019t get changed willy-nilly.AppC also ensures that organizations stay in continuous compliance with regulatory mandates.This is a bad one: VMware puts the flaw, CVE-2021-21998, in the critical severity range with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 9.4 out of 10. The bug is an authentication bypass that could enable an attacker with network access to the server to get administrative privileges without needing to authenticate.According to VMware\u2019s advisory, the authentication-bypass bug affects AppC versions 8.0, 8.1, 8.5 before 8.5.8, and 8.6 before 8.6.2.As pointed out by Heimdal Security, depending on the environment, threat actors could exploit the vulnerability \u201cto maximum advantage to attack anything from point-of-sale [systems] (PoS) to industrial-control systems.\u201dTo avoid that, organizations must patch, as there are no workarounds available.Below are the patches, listed in the Fixed Version column of the VMware\u2019s Response Matrix:8.5.8Credit for discovering and reporting CVE-2021-21999 goes to Zeeshan Shaikh from NotSoSecure, who worked with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) and Hou JingYi of Qihoo 360.Plus This: High-Risk Bug in Other VMware ProductsBesides the authentication-bypass fix, VMware also published a security advisory for a high-risk bug in VMware Tools, VMware Remote Console for Windows (VMRC), and VMware App Volumes products.At this point, the bug doesn\u2019t have a severity score from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), but VMware evaluated it at 7.8 (high severity). The flaw, CVE-2021-21999, is a local privilege-escalation vulnerability.VMware\u2019s advisory lists the affected products as VMware Tools for Windows (11.x.y prior to 11.2.6), VMware Remote Console for Windows (12.x prior to 12.0.1) , and VMware App Volumes (2.x prior to 2.18.10 and 4 prior to 2103).Once again, there\u2019s no workaround for this one. Admins should patch it as soon as possible, given what VMware said can be done with it:An attacker with normal access to a virtual machine may exploit this issue by placing a malicious file renamed as `openssl.cnf\u2019 in an unrestricted directory which would allow code to be executed with elevated privileges.History of Critical HolesThe security hole in AppC is only the latest critical problem that VMware has addressed. In February, for one, VMware patched three vulnerabilities in its virtual-machine infrastructure for data centers, including a remote code-execution (RCE) flaw in its vCenter Server management platform. The vulnerability could allow attackers to breach the external perimeter of an enterprise data center or leverage backdoors already installed on a system, to find other vulnerable points of network entry to take over affected systems.More recently, in April, another critical cloud bug, again in VMWare Carbon Black, would have allowed takeover. The bug (CVE-2021-21982) ranked 9.1 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale. It would enable privilege escalation and the ability to take over the administrative rights for the VMware Carbon Black Cloud Workload appliance.Join Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Black Hat and DEF CON 2019 may be wrapping up, but the dual conferences last week in Las Vegas left the security industry with a flurry of new security flaws, topics and announcements to discuss for the weeks to come.Threatpost editors Tara Seals and Lindsey O\u2019Donnell get together to discuss the highs and lows from the conference. The highlights include a widespread trend around increased collaboration between vendors and researchers, pinpointed during the keynote by Square\u2019s Dino Dai Zovi. Other\u00a0 includes:An improved public\u00a0bug bounty program announced by Apple that increases product scope and rewardsMicrosoft offering $300,000 for working exploitsNew IoT flaws discovered \u2013 and in the process of being updated \u2013 in high-end hotelsIn addition, Threatpost discusses why Black Hat came under scrutiny for a sponsored \u201cTime AI\u201d encryption session that many researchers criticized as a scam. \u00a0From the highs to lows, listen to the full recap of the event below \u2013 and for direct download of the podcast, click here.Below is a lightly-edited transcript of the podcast.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell: This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell and Tara Seals with Threatpost, on the Threatpost podcast. We\u2019re just coming off the heels of Black Hat USA in Las Vegas last week, and it was a whirlwind of a show. Tara, how are you recovering so far?Tara Seals: Hi, Lindsey. Thanks for having me. I\u2019m recovering, it was a whirlwind. And even though it\u2019s a two-day conference, it just feels like it\u2019s much longer, bigger and crazier than what it looks like on paper.LO: It\u2019s certainly a lot that they pack in. And Tom, our editor-in-chief, is just coming off from DEF CON, too. So there\u2019s definitely a lot of really cool coverage that he did there, too. Between the two conferences, we had some great speakers that we saw, some really interesting sessions, and new vulnerabilities and news from the show \u2014 starting right from the get-go with the opening keynote with Dino Dai Zovi, the mobile security lead at Square, who set the theme of the show with his discussion about security as it relates to communication and collaboration with other teams. So that was really cool.TS: Yeah, definitely, I thought he was really engaging. And the way that he had structured it too was pretty interesting, because he started off talking about his very first Black Hat and how he just spent the whole time doing Capture the Flag exercises. And how where security fits into the corporate landscape and cultural landscape has changed over time, since that first DEF CON. His point was basically discussing security\u2019s role in the workplace, and how, as everybody goes towards the cloud, and goes towards honing a DevOps, agile mindset for where software fits into the landscape, and enabling business processes, where security has to fit into that. Some of the challenges institutionally and culturally and being able to really do a good job with security over time. So I thought it was really interesting, it\u2019s very different than previous Black Hat keynotes.LO: It was interesting that he was talking a bit about, like you said, the transformation over the past more-than-a-decade. But it really shows you where the \u00a0infosec space is right now, because his thought was that the security space has really made its mark at this point. And the voice of security awareness is out there with a lot of these companies, people realize that cybersecurity is important, but now the next challenge is really going to be focusing on how one communicates and hones their strategy around collaborating with various teams within companies. And that that is a big challenge for the security community right now.TS: Yeah, definitely. And he touched on the fact that a lot of times security teams are small, and companies do have resource constraints in terms of getting the security expertise that they need, especially larger companies, where you might have a whole bunch of different divisions that they have to collaborate with. He also made a huge point about automation. And using software tools, like fuzzing and things like, that to scale your security efforts so you can do more with a small team. \u201cUsing the leverage of automation\u201d was the terminology that he used. Recognizing that you can\u2019t be everywhere at once, what can you automate? What can you give to your policies and your processes to take the weight off a little bit?LO: Yeah, I was curious about how much automation would really be discussed at the conference. And I feel like it was talked about a fair amount. So I was really glad he brought that into the opening keynote, and set the tone there for that as well.TS:\u00a0Yeah, definitely. I mean, in my conversations with people and just at the sessions. I definitely felt that there were the typical Black Hat sessions around \u201chow we discovered this new exploit vector,\u201d or, \u201chere are some vulnerabilities that we think are interesting,\u201d or a lot of technical talks. But there was more discussion around organizational mindsets and from a business perspective, what to do with security.LO: And then there was also a lot of discussion too around Apple, which they had some of the biggest news in my opinion from the show, which is that they were improving their bug-bounty program. But then even beyond that, there were also a bunch of vulnerabilities that were discovered in Apple products. But the bug-bounty program news was huge. They basically said that they would open their historically private program to all researchers starting in the fall. And then they were going to\u2026 up their rewards for different vulnerabilities found in devices, including a $1 million payout for a certain vulnerability that could be discovered. And then also added more devices to be in-scope for its program, like Mac devices, WatchOS and TVOS.TS: So this is really interesting to me, because I kind of feel like they are way behind the curve. And Apple is not a company to be behind the curve on much. But on this, they are really late to the party in terms of having a bug-bounty program that\u2019s open where they can crowdsource expertise. So did they say anything about that, or why there\u2019s been a lag, or why they were reluctant to do this before?LO: Researchers who I talked to after the fact said that they have been historically, notoriously closed with their program, and also in how they communicate with the security industry. And I feel like Apple has always had that kind of hands-on, \u201cwe can do this ourselves,\u201d attitude, but researchers are saying now that they really are looking to external researchers to help. And I think we saw that earlier this year, if you remember the teenager who discovered the huge eavesdropping flaw in FaceTime, and Apple got a lot of flack for the fact that they took a while to respond to him, and it was a whole mess. So I think that they\u2019re really starting to open their eyes to the benefits that bug-bounty programs and researchers in general can really bring to the company in terms of finding these glitches in their products.And a lot of researchers also said, this is a huge step in Apple further firming its relationship with the security space. So I think that should be something to keep an eye on. Their bug-bounty program was, like you said, really behind: It was closed, it was invite only, the rewards were only as high as $200,000. And then they also had limited in-scope products.And the fact that they didn\u2019t have a program that addresses Mac has long been criticized by different researchers. I think last year, if you remember, Google bug-hunter Ian Beer criticized Apple at Black Hat 2018 for how it handles Mac security and iOS security, and was talking about how Apple really needs to step up in terms of how it interacts with researchers around the security bugs. So just the contrast between that session last year and this announcement this year, really goes to show that there are hopefully going to be steps taken by Apple to improve on this.TS: For sure. And obviously these programs need to evolve with the times, which is a little bit of a segue way to another story that that you covered Lindsey. That was also huge about Microsoft\u2019s opening up at $300,000 rewards for cloud exploits. That one was pretty interesting too, it definitely made a lot of a lot of waves at the conference.LO: Yeah, I feel like bug-bounties in general and the relationship between vendors and researchers was a huge topic this year. It was Apple, it was Microsoft. And then this was something we didn\u2019t cover, but Google also did something similar in terms of Google Cloud, \u00a0offering their rewards there.But yeah, so Microsoft, just for context, announced that it\u2019s going to offer awards of up to $300,000 for researchers who could launch successful test exploits for the [Azure] platform. So it would be different from just a bug-bounty program, because that means that instead of just researching vulnerabilities, the company is going to offer cloud host testing environments called Azure Security labs, where researchers can essentially test live exploits because they\u2019re isolated from the Azure production environments that \u00a0customers are using. That\u2019s going to be beneficial for researchers, that gives them a little more flexibility and ultimately allows Microsoft as well to benefit from that.I really liked what I saw in terms of companies starting to not just focus on vulnerabilities and issues and glitches that were in products. This conference, there was also really a branching between different vendors and researchers. And I also noticed to a lot of sessions had vendors and researchers that were co-presenting sessions. So if researchers found a vulnerability in a product, this was the case with BMW, then BMW or the vendor that the vulnerability was within their products would come forward and be like, this is what happened, this is what we did to mitigate the situation in collaboration with the researchers. And this is what we\u2019re doing moving forward to resolve future issues. And I really like that, I feel like it went along with that theme of collaboration that the conference had.TS: Yeah, absolutely. That was very cool. And speaking of vulnerabilities, there were a few that were really interesting that we got to see sessions on, as well. The IoT stuff \u2014 there were some pretty good sessions on IoT. You did one about a hotel smart lock, I think.LO: Yeah, I always like to learn more about IoT vulnerabilities so that one was really cool for me. These two German researchers/hackers presented about how they were able to hack into a popular IoT smart lock that was used by a high-end hotel in Europe, and essentially break into hotel rooms, and all kinds of other malicious activities that no one wants to happen. And so they didn\u2019t reveal the lock or the hotel chain, because at this point, these locks are being actively used by the hotel. And they\u2019re still in the process of disclosure and updates. They did give a walk-through of what they were able to do. Hotels are increasingly using these IoT locks in lieu of key cards; instead, guests can use their mobile phones for room access.TS: That was my question. So it\u2019s an app, basically, that goes on your phone \u2013 and then do you enter a code? Or do you wave it [in front of the lock]? Is it like a Bluetooth thing?LO:\u00a0 Yeah, so it\u2019s Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It\u2019s your on phone, and then you have the smart lock, and then you essentially put it up to the lock, and through Bluetooth Low Energy it\u2019s able to unlock the door. By the way these hackers love breaking into locks and electronic locks. So this is kind of their passion, they had a couple of interesting previous research pieces that they\u2019ve done for smart locks and just regular locks. But they\u2026essentially found that they were able to first gain access to and analyze the Bluetooth Low Energy traffic used by the system. And from there, they were able to use wireless sniffing to discover what the credential packet was, and from there, they were able to figure out that they could launch a key-stealing attack on the IoT smart lock. And they could just easily break into any hotel room, or they could even, because this was also used by elevators and the fitness center in the hotel, they were able to stop elevators remotely or go into the fitness center (though I don\u2019t know how [the fitness center] would be a malicious attack).TS: Still, that\u2019s kind of terrifying.LO: Yeah, so I think the most interesting part of the talk too was that they were talking about some of the challenges in the disclosure process. And one of the biggest challenges \u2014 and this is something we\u2019re seeing with a lot of IoT devices and vulnerabilities that people are finding in them in general \u2014 is that they need to not just work with the vendor, but there\u2019s a bunch of different manufacturers and vendors that go into each IoT device. So they had to reach out to the software vendor, the app vendor. It was a whole process for them.TS: Yeah. Which also fits back with our bug bounty and vendor collaboration conversation.LO: Yeah, for sure. There was also at Black Hat, I\u2019m just seeing now, there was a lot of controversy too about this \u201cTime AI\u201d sponsored session. Do you know what part of the conference that was? Was it towards the beginning?TS: I\u2019m not sure which day it was on, but I know that the controversy started breaking on Thursday. I don\u2019t know if it was Wednesday afternoon, or if it was Thursday morning or whatnot. But yeah, this was a sponsored session, which of course, vendors pay to get time, and then they can use that time any way that they want. So it\u2019s not vetted by the conference people for content.The company was called Crown Sterling, which it\u2019s not a company I\u2019ve heard of. I don\u2019t know what kind of reputation they have out there in the marketplace, but after this, probably not a very good one, because the the speaker got up there and started talking about a new type of encryption that he termed \u201cTime AI.\u201d And he didn\u2019t give a lot of technical details, it was a little bit of mumbo-jumbo, talking about how his company has this mysterious, intriguing sort of quantum physics-based encryption algorithm that\u2019s unbreakable. And trying to use that as a marketing differentiator.And researchers cried BS on it, essentially. And he was also using some jargon when he was talking about it, like \u201cinfinite wave conjugations\u201d and some other phases that he didn\u2019t link back to any technical specifics. And so people started taking to Twitter and making fun of this, researchers were saying that it\u2019s dangerous and that he\u2019s basically committing fraud by saying that he\u2019s got this type of encryption technique, that clearly cannot exist or does not exist, and if it does, he needs to prove it. Eventually, the conference organizers actually deleted him from their audio recordings and decided to cut off access to his talk completely, even the recorded version after the fact.LO: Wow, that\u2019s really something that is interesting. I\u2019m curious about the approval process for talks, do they have to go through some sort of vetted approval board or something? I feel like this is something that probably Black Hat should have caught earlier for their part.TS: Yeah, so most of the conference talks are vetted, for sure. They have a board of industry experts, and they have the call-for-papers process and everything\u2019s curated. But with the sponsored sessions, that\u2019s just basically advertorial, that\u2019s just a different form of advertising. And so they buy the space and they can use that space for whatever they want. They could be\u2026doing an infomercial. In this case, this company decided to showcase a so-called security technology. And they are defending their technology, they\u2019re on Twitter talking about the fact that they feel that they\u2019re perfectly legitimate, and here\u2019s why and blah, blah, blah.LO: I think it\u2019s hard, especially when they\u2019re talking about encryption and cryptography. I think this is hitting a hot spot for a lot of researchers, in terms of if it is some sort of scam or marketing or whatnot. So hopefully, Black Hat at least learned something from this for future shows. I don\u2019t know if this has happened over in the past, but definitely something to be learned there.TS: Well, yeah. If you\u2019re trying to provide a platform [for legitimate educational content] and somebody gets up there making these crazy wild claims. I understand that it\u2019s paid-for space, but maybe they could use some light oversight on it.LO: \u00a0Right, for sure. Well, it was definitely a crazy conference. And I feel like we wrote so much. But there\u2019s still so much news that we need to continue to wrap up on this this week. So I gotta go write.TS:\u00a0Yeah, there\u2019s a lot of stuff to do the Monday after Black Hat.LO: For sure. Well, Tara, thanks for coming on and talking a bit about your experience with the show. And yes, for everyone else, be sure to keep up with Threatpost.com for the newest and latest Black Hat and DEF CON research that we will continue to wrap up on for this week.TS: Thanks for having me, Lindsey.LO: Great, thanks.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Researchers at Black Hat USA 2019 demoed \u00a0how known vulnerabilities in WhatsApp could still be exploited in several attacks that manipulate chats.Facebook-owned WhatsApp is a popular end-to-end encrypted messaging platform with at least 1.5 billion users. Researchers with Check Point last year disclosed three different attack methods that can let attackers change chat users\u2019 messages, make private messages public and change sender identities.And so far, two of the three attack methods are still open to attack, researchers said.\u201cWhatsApp end-to-end encryption ensures that only you and the person you\u2019re communicating with can read what\u2019s sent, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. However, we managed to reverse-engineer WhatsApp web source code and successfully decrypted WhatsApp traffic,\u201d Check Point researchers Roman Zaikin and Oded Vanunu said in their Black Hat USA session on Wednesday, \u201cReverse Engineering WhatsApp Encryption for Chat Manipulation and More.\u201dAfter decrypting the WhatsApp communications, researchers found that the messaging platform uses the \u201cprotobuf2\u201d protocol for encryption. By converting this protobuf2 data to Json, researchers were able to see the actual parameters for the messages that were sent and manipulate them in order to spoof messages.Using this method of reverse engineering coupled with social engineering, researchers were able to launch three attacks via WhatsApp:Altering the text of a chat user\u2019s reply, essentially putting words in their mouth;Using the \u201cquote\u201d feature of a group chat to change the identity of the sender (even if they are not part of the group chat);And ending a private message to another group chat user that is disguised as a public message for all, so that when the recipient responses their response is visible to everyone in the conversation.The latter issue has been fixed by WhatsApp, while the first two glitches remain exploitable, researchers said.Check Point researchers Roman Zaikin and Oded Vanunu talk WhatsApp at Black Hat 2019\u201cDuring the process we unveiled new vulnerabilities that could allow threat actors to intercept and manipulate messages sent in both private and group conversations, giving attackers immense power to create and spread misinformation from what appear to be trusted sources,\u201d the duo said.These attacks have various malicious purposes for threat actors: For instance, in the third attack vector (above) a bad actor could manipulate a certain member of a group chat and trick them into revealing information to the group that they may otherwise not want them to know. Or, by altering the text of a recipient\u2019s reply, a bad actor could incriminate a person unfairly, or close a fraudulent deal.Meanwhile, WhatsApp has had its fair share of privacy vulnerabilities this year. In May, a zero-day vulnerability was exploited by attackers who were able to inject spyware onto victims\u2019 phones in targeted campaigns; while in July, researchers found\u00a0faulty developer coding that allows cyberattackers to intercept media files sent on the Android versions of the service.Facebook did not have a statement when reached for comment.Black Hat USA 2019 has kicked off this week in Las Vegas.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Supply-chain attacks have nabbed headlines lately thanks to high-profile incidents like the Wipro news last April, where attackers were able to compromise the staffing agency\u2019s network and pivot to their customers. That incident pointed out that supply-chain risk should be thought of in a much more holistic fashion than it usually is, with people at its heart, according to Eric Doerr, GM at the Microsoft Security Response Center.Speaking at Black Hat 2019 on Thursday, Doerr pointed out that supply-chain risk comes from four main areas: Hardware, software, services and people. All are important, but it\u2019s the latter, he maintained, that should be the top focus.\u201cPeople like to think about hardware as the main supply-chain threat, but really, you need to start with people \u2013 your contractors and partners,\u201d he said. He added that people aren\u2019t just introducing risk into corporate environments \u2014 they\u2019re also the key to proactively driving it out.Wipro: A Case StudyThough Edward Snowden made the risk from contractor threats infamous, most companies still don\u2019t see the risk coming from people as their biggest issue, according to Doerr \u2013 even though they should.This was highlighted in the Wipro incident, as it rapidly became clear as the story unfolded that an advanced threat actor had been able to access the networks of multiple companies through the trusted vendor relationships they had established with IT consulting giant.\u201cAt Microsoft, we wondered if perhaps other staffing agencies were impacted,\u201d Doerr said. \u201cWe think some of the Olympics stuff may have had a component of this as well. Anyone in incident response now you spend a lot of time chasing things down that turn out to be false alarms, but we had to explore it. We have thousands of Wipro employees working in various parts of Microsoft doing important things.\u201dWhile it turned out that Microsoft wasn\u2019t impacted by this particular attack, Doerr noted that there were several lessons learned in its exploration process when it comes to locking down the \u201cpeople\u201d part of the supply chain.\u201cYou\u2019ve threat-modeled a policy and now you\u2019re testing your threat model,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw it as a great opportunity to test our thought process and that model.\u201dFor instance, the first thing Microsoft did was to look at its already compiled inventory of third-party contacts, and perform an audit to determine if any contractors or partners were working on sensitive projects or have access to sensitive systems. Then, it determined if the security policies and procedures about where those third-party people are embedded had been followed.Other steps that Microsoft took were to look for malicious signs and block any suspicious behavior; force a credentials reset (even though it was unpopular with employees); and add monitoring to all partner interfaces. Reports of the attack also mentioned a specialized Mimikatz binary that the attackers used, so Microsoft also deployed a signature for that.\u201cWhat we took away from this is that you have to assume that humans, like routers and software, will get breached eventually \u2013 and you have to be in the position of being satisfied that the damage will be manageable,\u201d Doerr said.To get into that position, it\u2019s important to inventory everyone and everything on one\u2019s network, and then employ the principle of least privilege, he added: \u201cWhere do you want to implant a partner or vendor? What kind of access do they need or should they have? You have to answer these questions.\u201dThen, make sure that there are tools and systems in place that can ensure that they can\u2019t deviate from policy; and, where possible, provide the devices that third parties will use to do their jobs.\u201cThis is very hard, especially when dealing with vendors that work across companies,\u201d Doerr acknowledged. \u201cYou have to determine if you can hand out laptops like candy \u2013 but also if you can you expect them to juggle three or four different laptops as they move from place to place.\u201dSoftware: The People DimensionThe other attack vectors in the supply chain also tie back to people in many ways, Doerr added. For instance, when news broke that the CCleaner APT was targeting networks via the TeamViewer remote viewing software, talking to people became key to incident response at Microsoft.\u201cTeamViewer is used for provisioning and troubleshooting of physical machines, and it\u2019s one of the more scary things you might have in your environment,\u201d Doerr said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not always obvious why someone is using something.\u201dSo, Microsoft did an audit of who was using TeamViewer, and then manually went and talked to the teams to find out what they were using it for.\u201cYou have to go and explore these things, because you have to balance theoretical security with business disruption,\u201d he said.The investigation uncovered that some people were interacting with third-party hardware suppliers using TeamViewer, because that\u2019s what the vendors were using to debug equipment. The fact that the risk was being introduced from external partners brought up an additional dimension of diplomacy: Having open and transparent conversations about vulnerabilities and susceptibility to attacks that don\u2019t involve blame are key to proactively mitigating third-party risk.\u201cHow far do you get to mandate policy and governance?\u201d Doerr said. \u201cDo I tell the supplier that they can\u2019t use a piece of software? What about the supplier of the supplier? It\u2019s critical to get past the usual adversarial model and forge a true partnership with suppliers where you talk about shared risk. Because in the end, we\u2019re all in this together.\u201dIn the end, Doerr said, when it comes to supply-chain risk, the human element should be central.\u201cStart with people, because for most companies this the biggest risk and the least well understood, but the easiest to mitigate with the tools you probably have on hand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, how we treat people above and below us in the supply chain really matters \u2013 again, we\u2019re all in this together.\u201dBlack Hat USA 2019 has kicked off this week in Las Vegas.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 A path-traversal vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) leaves unpatched Azure customers open to attack. The flaw could allow for a virtual machine (VM)\u00a0escape in Microsoft\u2019s Hyper-V Manager, part of its Azure cloud platform.Researchers with Check Point at a Wednesday\u00a0Black Hat USA 2019 session detailed the medium-level vulnerability (CVE-2019-0887), which was patched last month in Microsoft\u2019s July Patch Tuesday update. The flaw impacts Microsoft\u2019s Hyper-V tool: A virtualization technology that is used in Microsoft\u2019s Azure cloud and is offered as a virtualization product on top of the Windows 10 operating system.\u201cNow that there is a patch for the path-traversal vulnerability, we highly recommend all users to install the patch to protect both their RDP connections and their Hyper-V environment,\u201d researchers urged. \u201cWhile it was hard for any security researcher to miss Microsoft\u2019s effort to test and improve the security of its Hyper-V technology, we can learn an important lesson from this research. As the saying goes: your system is only as strong as its weakest link. In other words, by depending on other software libraries, Hyper-V Manager inherits all of the security vulnerability that are found in RDP, and in any other software library that it uses.\u201dThe flaw was initially found in February to impact Windows system, when researchers found it affecting all versions of Windows from Windows 7 to 10, and Windows Server 2008 to 2019. However, researchers said that\u00a0Microsoft did not move forward with a CVE and patch until after they discovered its impact extended to Hyper V.The initial flaw stemmed from a malicious RDP server\u2019s ability to send a crafted file to transfer clipboard content that will cause a path traversal on the client\u2019s machine. That\u2019s because clipboard redirection is handled in a way where malicious files are not sanitized.It requires an attacker to have access to an Remote Desktop Services (RDS) server; when a victim connects to that server, a malicious server can send a crafted file transfer clipboard content that will cause a path-traversal on the client\u2019s machine.That means an attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on virtual machines; an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights, researchers said.After disclosing the initial vulnerability for Windows machines, researchers said they received numerous comments regarding whether the flaws in Microsoft\u2019s RDP client could impact its Hyper-V product. That\u2019s because Hyper-V uses \u201cenhanced sessions,\u201d which essentially offers users an extended functionality that includes the same clipboard synchronization process between the guest and the host that is utilized in Windows systems.Researchers had found the path-traversal vulnerability in the clipboard synchronization implemented by Microsoft\u2019s RDP client; they found that they were able to run a Hyper-V guest-to-host VM escape over the control interface, using the same RDP vulnerability.\u201cWhile it was hard for any security researcher to miss Microsoft\u2019s effort to test and improve the security of its Hyper-V technology, we can learn an important lesson from this research,\u201d said the analysts. \u201cAs the saying goes: Your system is only as strong as its weakest link. In other words, by depending on other software libraries, Hyper-V Manager inherits all of the security vulnerability that are found in RDP, and in any other software library that it uses.\u201dBlack Hat USA 2019 has kicked off this week in Las Vegas.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 Serious vulnerabilities have been disclosed in LeapFrog\u2019s tablet for kids, the LeapPad Ultimate, once again throwing child data privacy into the spotlight.The LeapPad Ultimate is a rugged tablet made by LeapFrog that targets children with an array of education, game and eBook apps. Researchers, who disclosed the flaws at Black Hat 2019 on Wednesday, said the tablet has a number of security issues opening the door to a slew of malicious activities by an adversary. Those include allowing bad actors to track the devices, send messages to children or launch man-in-the-middle attacks.\u201cManufacturers need to realize that the target audience is less suspicious, more na\u00efve, and more likely to miss even simple warning signs of attacks,\u201d Erez Yalon, director of security research at Checkmarx, told Threatpost. \u201cAlso, the consequences of privacy breaches may be catastrophic when it comes to children. So as a general rule, manufacturers need to apply the most stringent standards.\u201dSeveral flaws circle around a specific in-house app offered by the tablet, Pet Chat, which allows children to talk to each other in a chat room using a pet avatars and some preset phrases and emoticons. Users can only communicate with one another via preset phrases.Researchers reported the flaws to LeapFrog in December 2018, and LeapFrog removed the vulnerable app, Pet Chat, from stores in June 2019.Yalon told Threatpost that while researchers did not request a CVE for the flaw, they considered the impact of the vulnerabilities to be severe. However,\u00a0there\u2019s no evidence of the flaws being exploited in the wild, he said.\u201cWe thank Checkmarx for bringing these security issues to our attention, as the safety of the children who use our products is a top priority,\u201d said Mari Sunderland, VP of digital product management at LeapFrog in a statement about the flaws. \u201cWith the information they provided, we were able to take immediate actions to resolve the issues. Checkmarx has been helpful, ethical, and professional. Cooperating with them has benefited LeapFrog and our customers.\u201dPet Chat IssuesPet Chat has an array of issues that could allow allow malicious actors to either track the tablets or send a \u201cpreset\u201d message to the tablet user.The Pet Chat app creates a Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc connection that broadcasts to other compatible devices nearby using the simple SSID: \u201cPet Chat.\u201d \u00a0Researchers were able to use a tool called WiGLE \u2013 a website for collecting information about the different wireless hotspots around the globe that puts location and other information in a central database \u2013 to identify the tablets.That means that \u201canyone can identify the possible location of LeapPads using Pet Chat by finding them on public Wi-Fi or tracking their device\u2019s MAC address,\u201d said researchers.In addition, \u201cwe discovered that the Pet Chat protocol does not require any authentication between a parent\u2019s device and a child\u2019s device,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThis means that any bystander within 100 ft. of a Leapfrog device running Pet Chat can send a message to a child\u2019s device. It is easy to understand the potential implications of that type of activity.\u201dLuckily, messages are \u201cpreset\u201d emojis or messages \u2013 however, an attacker could in theory send one of these preset messages for malicious purposes, such as using the preset phrase \u201cLet\u2019s go! play outside together\u201d to persuade a child to go outside.Researchers said that after they reported the issues to LeapFrog, the company removed the Pet Chat app from stores \u2013 however, LeapPad devices that are older than three years may still have the app installed. In that case, researchers advised parents to manually uninstall the app.Other FlawsOther flaws were discovered in the kid\u2019s tablet. For instance, researchers said that outgoing traffic from LeapPad was not encrypted using HTTPS but instead the clear-text and less secure HTTP protocol. That makes the tablet vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks, which could allow a bad actor to intercept traffic and obtain sensitive data such as credit card information as well as personal details about children (name, gender and birthday).A proof of concept video fo the MiTM attack is in the video below.Yalon told Threatpost that the resolution of these flaws was more trivial and only required mere code changes: \u201cLeapFrog was very responsive and addressed those during the first wave of fixes,\u201d he said.It\u2019s only the latest children\u2019s toy to have issues around security and privacy:\u00a0After CloudPets connected teddy bears were found to have exposed 2.2 million voice recordings between parents and their children in a significant data breach, Amazon, Target and Walmart have pulled the toys from their online markets. Genesis Toys\u2019\u00a0My Friend Cayla doll (which was banned in Germany) and Mattel\u2019s\u00a0Hello Barbie\u00a0doll have also undergone major security issues.Black HatEditor's PicksMobile Security",

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 At a time when technology is being utilized for human-rights abuses, the security space needs to turn its focus to public interest defense technology, security stalwarts urged during Black Hat USA 2019.Security has long focused on protecting company data and providing cyber-defense for governments, and ignoring a broader issue: Those utilizing the endpoint devices, some of whom may be a target of human rights violations. Society has a responsibility to recognize the importance of protecting these individuals\u2019 rights as well, argued Bruce Schneier, fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Camille Francois, chief innovation officer at Graphika.\u201cWhen we talk about security, we have to ask, \u2018security for who?'\u201d said Galperin, speaking at a Black Hat session called \u201cHacking for the Greater Good: Empowering Technologists to Strengthen Digital Society.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s usually for governments or corporations. We don\u2019t talk about security for individuals, particularly individuals who don\u2019t have a lot of spending money.\u201dTechnology abuses are rife, from more generic concerns such as consumer data privacy, to more targeted threats, such as government surveillance of journalists and dissidents, and on highly-personal level, its use in domestic abuse cases.To fight cases like these, Galperin stressed that the security industry needs ethical hackers and technologists who don\u2019t merely have a degree in computer science, but who also have the creativity and empathy skills that can be applied to looking at cybersecurity in the context of social causes.\u201cWe need someone to\u00a0hold the hands of people who have been abused or harassed by partners or governments, and that doesn\u2019t require a computer science degree,\u201d said Galperin. \u201cYou need to understand your population first and what they need.\u201dIn recent times, technologists have stepped up into this role by increasingly collaborating with journalists and members of the government \u2013 for instance, the Federal Trade Commission now has staff technologists \u00a0\u2013 to help them better understand the cybersecurity threats that are threatening the security of the public interest.The security industry can also play a larger part in fighting human rights threats through supporting organizations such as the Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and more, said Schneier: \u00a0\u201cWe need to help defend organizations that are doing public good \u2013 we don\u2019t do enough praising those in IT\u2026 working for those around the world being attacked by governments,\u201d he said.Looking ahead, the dangers that are tied to technology will become paramount, particularly as device dangers begin to have a physical impact. For instance, automation and the Internet of Things (IoT) introduce new threats \u2013 connected medical device threats that could harm the body, for instance, or exploits for connected car vulnerabilities.In these cases, \u201chacking for the public good\u201d will take on a new meaning when it\u2019s not just about the data, but instead has a physical impact, said Schneider.\u201cWhen you look at how computers are affecting the world, the notion that computers are going to touch objects, will drive cars and change thermostats, will make a huge difference in how our industry interacts with the world,\u201d said Schneier. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer about data, we\u2019re in flesh and steel now.\u201dBlack Hat USA 2019 has kicked off this week in Las Vegas.

        "raw text": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 5G commercial networks are starting to roll out, promising exciting new use cases like automated cars, and smart sensor networks where the nodes have 10-year battery lives. To go along with these possibilities are new security requirements; notably, improvements in device authentication, traffic encryption, privacy protections for device IDs and credentials,and improvements in resilience and integrity.Click to enlarge.However, many of the security protocols and algorithms for 5G are being ported from the previous 4G standard, which researchers have found can still allow device fingerprinting for targeted attacks as well as the possibility of man-in-the-middle (MiTM) offensives.By way of background, 5G network architecture is made up of base stations (either macro or small-cell, depending on the application), which, like 4G cell towers, cover a specific area. These base stations connect to a mobile edge cloud, which in turn connects to the core network. In order to connect to a carrier network, 5G devices send a raft of information to the base station, which passes it on along the chain for eventual registration and authentication to the core network.The components inside devices allow different capabilities depending on what the device is used for, and according to Altaf Shaik, a graduate student at the Technical University of Berlin and Kaitiaki Labs, it\u2019s this information that gets sent to the base station. It includes things like whether or not voice calling is enabled, SMS ability, vehicle to vehicle communication (V2V) support, what frequency bands are being used, the device category (there are 20 of these, corresponding to the processing power of the device), and radio requirements, like whether the device needs the radio access network (RAN) to use MIMO to boost throughput speeds.At a session at Black Hat 2019 called \u201cNew Vulnerabilities in 5G Networks,\u201d presenting research he carried out with his partner, Ravishankar Borgaonkar of SINTEF Digital, Shaik noted that in 5G, as with 4G, the device capability information is sent to the base station before any security is layered onto the connection. Over-the-air security includes encryption of traffic from the endpoint to a base station; but since the device capabilities are transmitted prior to that kicking in, they are visible in plain text.This, according to Shaik, enables three kinds of attacks: Mobile network mapping (MNmap); bidding down; and battery drain on narrowband Internet of Things (NB IoT) devices.MNmapUsing real devices and commercial networks in Europe and the U.S., the research team was able to sniff the information sent by the device in plain text, and use it to create a map of devices connected to a given network.\u201cWe set up a fake base station to receive the capabilities of all the devices,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe categorized maker, model, OS, use case and version. This allows you to identify any cellular device in the wild. You can tell if a device is Android or iOS, if it\u2019s IoT or a phone, if it\u2019s a car modem, a router, a USB dongle a vending machine, etc.\u201dThat in turn paves the way for targeted attacks against a specific device or a whole class of devices, he added. \u201cYou can plan a targeted attack against a certain kind of device \u2013 such as those used in field testing, or military devices. There\u2019s also a privacy aspect here because you can link the IMSI to a specific person.\u201dMaking these identifications is possible in part because there are five main baseband manufacturers that implement certain capabilities used in endpoint hardware: Intel, Huawei, Mediatek, Samsung and Qualcomm. Not all capabilities are mandatory, so knowing what each baseband manufacturer enables can help fingerprint a device. A feature called EIAO for instance is typically disabled in Qualcomm but not in the others.\u201cOnce you know the baseband maker, you can tell what kind of modem the device uses, and you end up with a list of devices that use those modems,\u201d explained Shaik.At the same time, deductive reasoning using the rest of the data can be applied, given that different use cases require a different set of capabilities. Cars only need access to V2V, for instance; mobile phones need voice codecs; and IoT sensors need power saver mode enabled to protect their battery life.\u201cThis allows you to do a fair amount of fingerprinting,\u201d explained Shaik. \u201cWe collected the capabilities and created a reference model showing the baseband vendor, application, chipset name, 3GPP release.\u201dMiTM AttacksIn addition to MNmap, the bidding-down and battery-drain attacks become possible by implementing a MiTM relay to hijack the device information before security is applied, as it\u2019s being sent to the base station.\u201cYou can take this data and modify the capabilities,\u201d Shaik said. \u201cFor instance, the RAN defines the speed a device receives. An iPhone is supposed to receive speeds up to 1Gbps. You can change the device category so the RAN doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s an iPhone and instead delivers only 2Mbps, let\u2019s say.\u201dIn bidding down, adversaries cut off the capabilities of high-end devices. Attackers can remove carrier aggregation or MIMO enablement, which are used to boost speed; they could alter the frequency band information for a device to prevent handovers or roaming; or they could disable voice over LTE, which makes a phone revert to 3G/2G voice calling.Worse, the core network saves the capabilities for a device until it\u2019s restarted, giving the attack a persistence dimension.In testing, 22 out of 32 tested LTE networks worldwide were vulnerable to these types of attacks, Shaik said, with most of the tampering persisting for an average of seven days.The battery drain attack is targeted at NB-IoT devices, which are low-power sensors that send limited amounts of information infrequently. They boast a 10-year battery life, enabled thanks to power-saving mode (PSM) that turns them off when not in use.As a MiTM, an attacker can modify the PSM parameters, removing it altogether. Absent PSM,\u00a0 the device has continuous activity, scanning to find something to connect to. In testing, the researchers found that devices reset after an average of 13 days, reducing the battery life by a factor of five.FixesAfter reporting the issues (CVD-2019-0018) to the GSMA, 3GPP and other standards bodies, as well as the vendors, a fix was implemented in Release 14 of the 5G standard, to ensure that security is applied before the device sends its fingerprinting information.However, it will take a while for this to roll out commercially.\u201cAs far as we can tell, no vendor is actually implementing them yet,\u201d Shaik said. \u201cRelease 14 is quite new, so maybe next year we\u2019ll start seeing the fixes.\u201dFor existing 5G networks, MNmap remains possible; the device capabilities need to be protected by implementing mutual authentication before the information becomes accessible.\u201cThis is a problem, a fundamental issue that was ported from 4G,\u201d Shaik said. \u201cBut in 5G, there are more use cases and more capabilities that define exactly what kind of device it is, making targeting that much easier.\u201dBlack Hat USA 2019 has kicked off this week in Las Vegas.

        "raw text": "Signal, the encrypted messaging platform, is planning to launch an upgraded secure group messaging and communities function.Signal\u2019s groups are private, meaning that the service itself doesn\u2019t keep a record of a user\u2019s group memberships, group titles, group avatars or group attributes. But the way the privacy controls have been implemented have raised a few usability issues, including users having access to disparate \u201cgroup states\u201d (i.e., versions of a group\u2019s information), and it precludes role-based access control.\u201cEvery group member in Signal has the same permissions because what you learn about the group is only what other people tell you,\u201d the company explained in a posting on its upgrade efforts this week. \u201cTheir group state may not be accurate, or they could claim to be a role they really aren\u2019t.\u201dSignal\u2019s soon-to-be-released upgrade aims to solve these issues.Historical ApproachesIn order for a messaging server to effectively enforce access control (verifying that users do indeed belong to a group they\u2019re trying to access), and to ensure that all users are seeing the latest version of the group\u2019s information, the typical method is by keeping a plaintext database on a server that can be queried via a basic API, according to the company. But that means the server (and hackers who attack it) can \u201csee\u201d all of the group information stored there. In Signal\u2019s case, this clearly violates its privacy mandate.\u201cThe server knows everything about all groups, and it can also surreptitiously modify group membership and other group attributes. This isn\u2019t what we wanted for Signal,\u201d the company noted.So, Signal took a different approach, using pairwise encrypted channels that are already used in one-on-one Signal conversations.\u201cClients send group messages to each other tagged with a Group ID (a random 128-bit secret that cannot be guessed), and they also exchange group state updates \u2013 such as the group\u2019s name, attributes and membership \u2013 via the same method,\u201d according to the posting. \u201cClients never tell the service which messages are group messages or individual messages, or who is in the group. Instead, clients tell each other what they need to know.\u201dHowever, this distributed approach doesn\u2019t allow for a centralized, authoritative of group data that clients can easily reference \u2013 arising to the aforementioned usability problems.New ApproachGoing forward, Signal said that it has worked with Melissa Chase and Greg Zaverucha from Microsoft Research to extend their keyed-verification anonymous credentials concept.\u201cThe inherent contradiction is that the service needs to authenticate whether a membership record corresponds to the user making a request, but the user doesn\u2019t want the service to know who they are,\u201d explained Signal.To solve this, group members will be issued authentication credentials (AuthCredentials) by the service for their user identity (UID), and can then authenticate by proving to the server they have an authentication credential issued over the same UID that was included in a previous encrypted group membership entry. This is done without revealing the UID itself.\u201cWith an anonymous credential scheme, the service could issue authentication credentials to clients. Those clients could later prove possession of a credential, as well as facts about attributes bound into the credential, without revealing anything else,\u201d according to Signal.From a technical standpoint, clients will have to prove that their credential matches some ciphertext before they\u2019re allowed to download the it; and, that same UID must always encrypt to the same ciphertext within a group, so the client can recreate their ciphertext without fetching it, and servers can easily detect and reject duplicate entries.In Practice\u201cSuppose Alice has an AuthCredential for her UID, and a GroupMasterKey (only known by group members, not the server) for some particular group,\u201d according to the posting. \u201cThe server stores an encrypted membership list for the group. Each entry in the membership list is an encryption of some UID with the GroupMasterKey. To add Bob to the group, Alice must first prove to the server that she is allowed to make this change. Alice provides a zero-knowledge proof to the server that she possesses an AuthCredential matching some particular entry.\u201dAfter Alice proves to the server that she matches an entry, she sends the server a new entry encrypting Bob\u2019s UID. Alice also sends Bob the GroupMasterKey via an encrypted Signal message (technical details on all of the cryptographics are available here).\u201cGroups are inherently social, and Signal is a social app,\u201d the firm noted. \u201cWhether you\u2019re planning a surprise party, discussing last night\u2019s book club meeting, exchanging photos with your family, or organizing something important, group messaging has always been a key feature of Signal. We\u2019re moving into the future while keeping what we loved about the past.\u201dFree Threatpost Webinar:\u00a0Risk around third-party vendors is real and can lead to data disasters.

        "raw text": "Samsung shipped an estimated 100 million smartphones with botched encryption, including models ranging from the 2017 Galaxy S8 on up to last year\u2019s Galaxy S21.Researchers at Tel Aviv University found what they called \u201csevere\u201d cryptographic design flaws that could have let attackers siphon the devices\u2019 hardware-based cryptographic keys: keys that unlock the treasure trove of security-critical data that\u2019s found in smartphones.What\u2019s more, cyber attackers could even exploit Samsung\u2019s cryptographic missteps \u2013 since addressed in multiple CVEs \u2013 to downgrade a device\u2019s security protocols. That would set up a phone to be vulnerable to future attacks: a practice known as IV (initialization vector) reuse attacks. IV reuse attacks screw with the encryption randomization that ensures that even if multiple messages with identical plaintext are encrypted, the generated corresponding ciphertexts will each be distinct.Untrustworthy Implementation of TrustZoneIn a paper (PDF) entitled \u201cTrust Dies in Darkness: Shedding Light on Samsung\u2019s TrustZone Keymaster Design\u201d \u2013 written by by Alon Shakevsky, Eyal Ronen and Avishai Wool \u2013 the academics explain that nowadays, smartphones control data that includes sensitive messages, images and files; cryptographic key management; FIDO2 web authentication; digital rights management (DRM) data; data for mobile payment services such as Samsung Pay; and enterprise identity management.The authors are due to give a detailed presentation of the vulnerabilities at the upcoming USENIX Security, 2022 symposium in August.The design flaws primarily affect devices that use ARM\u2019s TrustZone technology: the hardware support provided by ARM-based Android smartphones (which are the majority) for a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to implement security-sensitive functions.TrustZone splits a phone into two portions, known as the Normal world (for running regular tasks, such as the Android OS) and the Secure world, which handles the security subsystem and where all sensitive resources reside. The Secure world is only accessible to trusted applications used for security-sensitive functions, including encryption.Cryptography Experts WinceMatthew Green, associate professor of computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, explained on Twitter that Samsung incorporated \u201cserious flaws\u201d in the way its phones encrypt key material in TrustZone, calling it \u201cembarrassingly bad.\u201d\u201cThey used a single key and allowed IV re-use,\u201d Green said.\u201cSo they could have derived a different key-wrapping key for each key they protect,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut instead Samsung basically doesn\u2019t. Then they allow the app-layer code to pick encryption IVs.\u201d The design decision allows for \u201ctrivial decryption,\u201d he said.So they could have derived a different key-wrapping key for each key they protect. But instead Samsung basically doesn\u2019t. Then they allow the app-layer code to pick encryption IVs. This allows trivial decryption. pic.twitter.com/fGHoY0YoZF\u2014 Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) February 22, 2022Paul Ducklin, principal research scientist for Sophos, called out Samsung coders for committing \u201ca cardinal cryptographic sin.\u201d Namely, \u201cThey used a proper encryption algorithm (in this case, AES-GCM) improperly,\u201d he explained to Threatpost via email on Thursday.\u201cLoosely speaking, AES-GCM needs a fresh burst of securely chosen random data for every new encryption operation \u2013 that\u2019s not just a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019 feature, it\u2019s an algorithmic requirement. In internet standards language, it\u2019s a MUST, not a SHOULD,\u201d Ducklin emphasized. \u201cThat fresh-every-time randomness (12 bytes\u2019 worth at least for the AES-GCM cipher mode) is known as a \u2018nonce,\u2019 short for Number Used Once \u2013 a jargon word that cryptographic programmers should treat as an *command*, not merely as a noun.\u201dUnfortunately, Samsung\u2019s supposedly secure cryptographic code didn\u2019t enforce that requirement, Ducklin explained. \u201cIndeed, it allowed an app running outside the secure encryption hardware component not only to influence the nonces used inside it, but even to choose those nonces exactly, deliberately and malevolently, repeating them as often as the app\u2019s creator wanted.\u201dBy exploiting this loophole, the researchers were able to pull off a feat that\u2019s \u201csupposed to be impossible, or as close to impossible as possible,\u201d he continued. Namely, the team were able to \u201cextract cryptographic secrets from *inside* the secure hardware.\u201dSo much for all the encryption security that the special hardware is supposed to enforce, Ducklin mused, as demonstrated by the researchers\u2019 multiple proof-of-concept security bypass attacks.Ducklin\u2019s admonishment: \u201cSimply put, when it comes to using proper encryption properly: Read The Full Manual!\u201dFlaws Enable Security Standards BypassThe security flaws not only allow cybercriminals to steal cryptographic keys stored on the device: They also let attackers bypass security standards such as FIDO2.According to The Register, as of the researchers\u2019 disclosure of the flaws to Samsung in May 2021, nearly 100 million Samsung Galaxy phones were jeopardized. Threatpost has reached out to Samsung to verify that estimate.Samsung responded to the academics\u2019 disclosure by issuing a patch for affected devices that addressed CVE-2021-25444: an IV reuse vulnerability in the Keymaster Trusted Application (TA) that runs in the TrustZone. Keymaster TA carries out cryptographic operations in the Secure world via hardware, including a cryptographic engine. The Keymaster TA uses blobs, which are keys \u201cwrapped\u201d (encrypted) via AES-GCM. The vulnerability allowed for decryption of custom key blobs.Then, in July 2021, the researchers revealed a downgrade attack \u2013 one that lets attacker trigger IV reuse vulnerability with privileged process. Samsung issued another patch \u2013 to address CVE-2021-25490 \u2013 that remoged the legacy blob implementation from devices including Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10, S20 and S21 phones.The Problem with Designing in the DarkIt\u2019s not just a problem with how Samsung implemented encryption, the researchers said. These problems arise from vendors \u2013 they called out Samsung and Qualcomm \u2013 keeping their cryptography designs close to the vest, the Tel Aviv U. team asserted.\u201cVendors including Samsung and Qualcomm maintain secrecy around their implementation and design of TZOSs and TAs,\u201d they wrote in their paper\u2019s conclusion.\u201cAs we have shown, there are dangerous pitfalls when dealing with cryptographic systems. The design and implementation details should be well audited and reviewed by independent researchers and should not rely on the difficulty of reverse engineering proprietary systems.\u201d\u2018No Security in Obscurity\u2019Mike Parkin, senior technical engineer at enterprise cyber risk remediation SaaS provider Vulcan Cyber, told Threatpost on Wednesday that getting cryptography right isn\u2019t exactly child\u2019s play. It\u2019s \u201d a non-trivial challenge,\u201d he said via email. \u201cIt is by nature complex and the number of people who can do proper analysis, true experts in the field, is limited.Parkin understands the reasons cryptologists push for open standards and transparency on how algorithms are designed and implemented, he said: \u201cA properly designed and implemented encryption scheme relies on the keys and remains secure even if an attacker knows the math and how it was coded, as long as they don\u2019t have the key.\u201dThe adage \u201cthere is no security in obscurity\u201d applies here, he said, noting that the researchers were able to reverse engineer Samsung\u2019s implementation and identify the flaws. \u201cIf university researchers could do this, it is certain that well-funded State, State sponsored, and large criminal organizations can do it too,\u201d Parkin said.John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at the digital IT and security operations company Netenrich, joins Parkin on the \u201copen it up\u201d side. \u201cProprietary and closed encryption design has always been a case study in failure,\u201d he noted via email on Wednesday, referring to the \u201cwide range of human rights abuses enabled by cell phone compromises,\u201d such as those perpetrated with the notorious Pegasus spyware.\u201cManufacturers should be more transparent and allow for independent review,\u201d Bambenek said.While most users have little to worry about with these (since-patched) flaws, they \u201ccould be weaponized against individuals who are subject to state-level persecution, and it could perhaps be utilized by stalkerware,\u201d he added.Eugene Kolodenker, staff security intelligence engineer at endpoint-to-cloud security company Lookout, agreed that best practice dictates designing security systems \u201cunder the assumption that the design and implementation of the system will be reverse-engineered.\u201dThe same goes for the risk of it being disclosed or even leaked, he commented via email to Threatpost.He cited an example: AES, which is the US standard of cryptography and accepted for top-secret information, is an open specification. \u201cThis means that the implementation of it is not kept secret, which has allowed for rigorous research, verification, and validation over the past 20 years,\u201d Kolodenker said.Still, AES comes with many challenges, he granted, and \u201cis often done incorrectly.\u201dHe thinks that Samsung\u2019s choice to use AES was a good decision. Unfortunately, the company \u201cdid not fully understand how to do so properly.\u201dAn audit of the whole system \u201cmight have prevented this problem,\u201d Kolodenker hypothesized.022422 10:15 UPDATE:\u00a0 Added input from Sophos\u2019 Paul Ducklin.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Mobile SecurityPrivacyVulnerabilities",

I'm watching for any details on what happens BEFORE wiper deployment. https://t.co/59SZTpTlXA\u2014 Katie Nickels (@likethecoins) February 23, 2022What might have been a bit more surprising was the welcome discovery, made by CrowdStrike\u2019s Intelligence Team earlier this week, that HermeticRansom had a lame encryption process that let the ransomware\u2019s tentacles be untangled.Avast Threat Labs had spotted the new ransomware strain last Thursday, Feb. 24. Avast, which named the new strain HermeticRansom, on Thursday released a free decryptor that incorporated a decryption script CrowdStrike released to GitHub, a user-friendly GUI and a set of instructions on its use.The decryptor can be downloaded here.Crypto Likely Weakened by Coding ErrorsHermeticRansom, aka PartyTicket, was identified at several victimized organizations, among other malware families that included what CrowdStrike called the \u201csophisticated\u201d HermeticWiper, aka DriveSlayer.Regardless of how sophisticated the wiper malware was, the ransomware that hopped a ride on it had less-than-stellar encryption, with a logic flaw in the encryption process that enabled researchers to break through, CrowdStrike said: \u201cAnalysis of the [PartyTicket/HermeticRansom] ransomware indicates it superficially encrypts files and does not properly initialize the encryption key, making the encrypted file with the associated .encryptedJB extension recoverable.\u201dAt the time it published its report, CrowdStrike hadn\u2019t traced the ransomware to a known threat actor. It didn\u2019t quite seem like a serious attempt at ransomware, at any rate, researchers said, given the coding errors that made its encryption \u201cbreakable and slow.\u201dEither the malware author was unfamiliar with writing in Go or rushed its development without thoroughly testing it, analysts surmised.Either way, it looked to analysts as if extortion wasn\u2019t the primary aim: \u201cThe relative immaturity and political messaging of the ransomware, the deployment timing and the targeting of Ukrainian entities are consistent with its use as an additional payload alongside DriveSlayer activity, rather than as a legitimate ransomware extortion attempt,\u201d they wrote.Below is a screen capture of HermeticRansom\u2019s extortion note:HermeticRansom ransomware demand note. Source: CrowdStrike Intelligence Team.HermeticWiper HistoryHermeticWiper, discovered last week, has been used against hundreds of machines in Ukraine \u2013 attacks that followed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks launched against Ukraine websites on Feb. 23.One of the HermeticWiper malware samples was compiled back on Dec. 28, pointing to the wiper attacks having been readied two months before Russia\u2019s military assault.HermeticWiper was only one of an onslaught of cyberattacks and malware that have been unleashed prior to and during the crisis, including the novel FoxBlade trojan, a wave of pre-invasion DDoS attacks in mid-February, plus another campaign of wiper attacks targeting Ukraine and aimed at eroding trust in January \u2013 just a few of an ongoing barrage of cyberattacks in the cyber warzone.Register Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event sked for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered more than 300 apps on the Google Play Store breaking basic cryptography code using a new tool they developed to dynamically analyze it.Academics from Columbia University developed a custom tool, CRYLOGGER, that analyzes Android applications for unsafe use of cryptographic code according to 26 basic cryptography rules. Those rules include avoiding the use of: broken hash functions, bad passwords, reusing passwords multiple times, HTTP URL connections or a \u201cbadly-derived\u201d key for encryption.The research team\u2014comprised of Luca Piccolboni,\u00a0\u00a0Giuseppe Di Guglielmo, Luca P. Carloni and Simha Sethumadhavan\u2014then set it loose on 1,780 of the most popular apps in the Play Store from 33 different categories. The team\u2019s analysis found that hundreds of them are breaking at least one if not several\u2014up to 18 in some cases\u2013of these basic rules.\nThe research sheds new light on how easy it is for popular mobile apps\u2014the ones analyzed had from hundreds of thousands of downloads to more than hundreds of millions\u2013to break basic security rules, researchers noted in their work. While the rules the team used to analyze the apps are common to developers specializing in cryptography, those building mobile apps aren\u2019t necessarily specialists in this area and thus can make very basic mistakes.To perform their analysis, researchers ran CRYLOGGER on the 1,780 apps while stimulating them with 30,000 random events, calling it \u201ca good compromise between running time and number of vulnerabilities found in a subset of these apps.\u201d Their tests took about 10 days to run on an emulator running Android 9.0.0r36.Three of the common cryptography rules most broken by offending Android apps were rules No. 18, 1 and 4, respectively, on the researchers\u2019 list. They are: Don\u2019t use an unsafe PRNG, or pseudorandom number generator; don\u2019t use broken hash function; and don\u2019t use the operation mode CBC.Researchers contacted the developers of all 306 Android apps and libraries to disclose the vulnerabilities; however, only 18 developers responded to the first email and only eight responded with \u201cuseful feedback\u201d on their findings, they said. The team also contacted six developers of Android libraries, of which two responded.CRYLOGGER is meant to be an open-source\u00a0 and dynamic companion to CryptoGuard, another open-source tool available on GitHub that researchers deem \u201cone of the most effective static tools to detect crypto misuses.\u201d\u201cWe hope that application developers will adopt it to check their applications as well as the third-party libraries that they use,\u201d researchers wrote in their paper (PDF) about their work, which will be presented next year in May 2021 at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.The Columbia team also made their tool available on GitHub. They said they chose to dynamically analyze code\u2014or while it\u2019s being executed\u2014for several reasons. Though static analysis has its benefits, it can create false positives or negatives or miss some of the crypto mistakes found in code as it\u2019s loading dynamically, they wrote.\u201cMost of the recent research efforts focused on static approaches, while little has been done to bring dynamic approaches to the same level of completeness and effectiveness,\u201d researchers wrote.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.CryptographyMobile Security",

        "raw text": "A fresh look at the Fronton DDoS-focused botnet reveals the criminal tool has more capabilities than previously known.The Fronton botnet first made the headline in March 2020. That is when, according to news reports, a hacktivist group called Digital Revolution said it obtained documents claiming to be from 0day Technologies, allegedly a contractor for Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service.Now the cybersecurity firm Nisos is reporting the Fronton malware goes beyond delivering DDoS attacks and can be used to create massive numbers of social media accounts that can then be used to shape opinion via social media manipulation.After further analysis of the documents related to Fronton, the Nisos researcher assert that DDoS \u201cis only one of the many capabilities of the system\u2026 Nisos analyzed the data and determined that Fronton is a system developed for coordinated inauthentic behavior on a massive scale,\u201d Nisos added.Working of FrontonFronton, researchers say, doubles as a backend infrastructure for the social media disinformation. The malware uses an army of compromised IOT devices to carry out both DDoS attacks and disinformation campaigns.\u201cThis system includes a web-based dashboard known as SANA that enables a user to formulate and deploy trending social media events en masse. The system creates these events that it refers to as \u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u044b, \u2018newsbreaks,\u2019 utilizing the botnet as a geographically distributed transport,\u201d according to researchers.SANA allows users to create fake social media accounts with generated email and phone numbers, these fake accounts are used to spread content across social networks, blogs and forums, researchers said.\u201cSANA creates social media persona accounts, including provisioning of an email and phone number,\u201d Nisos explained.Additionally, researchers note that the platform allows users to control the number of likes, comments, and reactions. As well as provide the \u201cfacilities for creating these newsbreaks on a schedule or a reactive basis\u201d, this will track the messages, trends, and their responses.A response model is specified to perform certain actions after the execution of the Newsbreak. The response model allows the group of bots to react to a piece of particular news in a certain fashion (positive, negative, or neutral), according to the report.\u201cThe response model allows an operator to specify weekly frequency of likes, comments, and reposts. It also allows for the selection of comments from the dictionary lists in order to direct the response patterns of the virtual social group,\u201d Nisos added in a report.The operators can also specify a minimum frequency of actions and a minimum interval between actions. The researcher also found the platform has \u201ca machine learning (ML) system involved that can be turned on or off based on behavior observed on social media.\u201dThe researcher added that Fronton operators have the capability to control the number of friends a fake bot should maintain, and integrate with a feature to store imagery for the bot.The usage of the tool in real-world attacks is not clear, and as of April 2022, the web portal is active and moved to a different domain.\u201cAs of April 2022, 0day technologies has changed its domain from 0day[.]ru to 0day[.]llc,\u201d Nisos noted.Nisos released a complete research report for further analysis.GovernmentIoTMalware",

        "raw text": "Unpatched vulnerabilities in the Spring Framework and WordPress plugins are being exploited by cybercriminals behind the Sysrv botnet to target Linux and Windows systems. The goal, according to researchers, is to infect systems with cryptomining malware.The botnet variant is being called Sysrv-K by Microsoft Security Intelligence researchers that posted a thread on Twitter revealing details of the botnet variant.Researchers said criminals behind Sysrv-K have programmed their bot army to scan for instances of the flaws in WordPress plugins as well as a recent remote code execution (RCE) flaw in the Spring Cloud Gateway (CVE-2022-22947).\n\n\u201cThese vulnerabilities, which have all been addressed by security updates, include old vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins, as well as newer vulnerabilities like CVE-2022-22947. Once running on a device, Sysrv-K deploys a cryptocurrency miner,\u201d said Microsoft Security Intelligence in a tweet.We encountered a new variant of the Sysrv botnet, known for exploiting vulnerabilities in web apps and databases to install coin miners on both Windows and Linux systems. The new variant, which we call Sysrv-K, sports additional exploits and can gain control of web servers.\u2014 Microsoft Security Intelligence (@MsftSecIntel) May 13, 2022The Spring Cloud is an open-source library that eases the process of developing the JVM application for the cloud and the Spring Cloud Gateway provides a library for building API Gateways for Spring and Java.The CVE-2022-22947 is a code injection vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Gateway library and an attacker can perform remote code execution (RCE) on unpatched hosts. The flaw affected the VMware and Oracle products and it has been marked as critical by both the vendors.Working of Sysrv-KThe Microsoft security intelligence team warned that Sysrv-K can gain control of the web servers by scanning the internet for various vulnerabilities to install itself. The vulnerabilities range from RCE to an arbitrary file download and path traversal to remote file disclosure.The security researcher at Lacework Labs and Juniper Threat Labs observed two main components of malware that is to spread itself across networks by scanning the internet for vulnerable systems and installing the XMRig cryptocurrency miner (used for mining Monero) following a surge of activity in March 2021.The new feature of Sysrv-K is that it scans for WordPress config files and their backups to steal credentials and gain access to the webserver. Apart from this \u201cSysvr-K has updated communication capabilities, including the ability to use a Telegram bot\u201d Microsoft added.\u201cLike older variants, Sysrv-K scans for SSH keys, IP addresses, and host names, and then attempts to connect to other systems in the network via SSH to deploy copies of itself. This could put the rest of the network at risk of becoming part of the Sysrv-K botnet\u201d the Microsoft security intelligence team reported.Microsoft advised the organizations to secure internet-facing Linux or Windows systems, timely apply security updates, and protect credentials. \u201cMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint detects Sysrv-K and older Sysrv variants, as well as related behavior and payloads,\u201d they added.The critical RCE, Worms, and 6 Zero-days including (CVE-2022-22947) were faced by Microsoft in January 2022.HacksVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The modular botnet known as Cyclops Blink, linked to the same advanced persistent threat (APT) behind the NotPetya wiper attacks, is expanding its device targeting to include ASUS routers.Further, it\u2019s likely that the botnet\u2019s purpose is far more sinister than the average Mirai-knockoff\u2019s penchant for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.That\u2019s the word from Trend Micro researchers, who noted that Cyclops Blink casts a wide net in terms of the owners of the devices it chooses to infect, with no specific focus on high-value government or diplomatic entities. While that\u2019s out of step with typical APT behavior, researchers said that it\u2019s likely the botnet will be used as persistent infrastructure for mounting further attacks on high-value targets, and as such, should be indiscriminately distributed for maximum effect.\u201cIt should be noted that these victims do not appear to be evidently valuable targets for either economic, military or political espionage,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s analysis. \u201cFor example, some of the live command-and-control servers (C2s) are hosted on WatchGuard devices used by a law firm in Europe, a medium-sized company producing medical equipment for dentists in Southern Europe and a plumber in the United States.\u201dCyclops Blink itself has been around since 2019, initially looking to infect WatchGuard Firebox devices according to a February analysis (PDF) performed by the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Now, to further its goal of widescale infections, ASUS routers are now on the menu, Trend Micro noted, with the latest variant incorporating a fresh module tailored to the vendor\u2019s devices.\u201cOur research was carried out on the RT-AC68U, but other ASUS routers such as RT-AC56U might be affected as well,\u201d researchers said. \u201cOur investigation shows that there are more than 200 Cyclops Blink victims around the world. Typical countries of infected WatchGuard devices and ASUS routers are the United States, India, Italy, Canada and a long list of other countries, including Russia.\u201dA Sinister Purpose?Cyclops Blink is the handiwork of the Russian-speaking Sandworm APT (a.k.a. Voodoo Bear or TeleBots), according to Trend Micro \u2013 the same group that\u2019s been linked to a host of very high-profile state-sponsored attacks, as well as the VPNFilter internet-of-things (IoT) botnet.\u201cSandworm was also responsible for\u2026the 2015 and 2016 attacks on the Ukrainian electrical grid, the 2017 NotPetya attack, the 2017 French presidential campaign, the 2018 Olympic Destroyer attack on the Winter Olympic Games and a 2018 operation against the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW),\u201d researchers noted in a Thursday analysis.Internet routers have been a favorite target for building out botnets for many years, thanks to \u201cinfrequency of patching, the lack of security software and the limited visibility of defenders\u201d when it comes to these devices, as Trend Micro put it. More often than not, such botnets are used to carry out DDoS attacks; but in Cyclops Blink\u2019s case, the motives are less obvious.\u201cThe purpose of this botnet is still unclear: Whether it is intended to be used for DDoS attacks, espionage or proxy networks remains to be seen,\u201d researchers said. \u201cBut what is evident is that Cyclops Blink is an advanced piece of malware that focuses on persistence and the ability to survive domain sinkhole attempts and the takedown of its infrastructure.\u201dIn fact, some of the infected devices that researchers observed have been compromised for more than two and a half years, with some set up as stable C2 servers for other bots.It is thus likely, the researchers speculated, that Cyclops Blink is destined for bigger horizons than denial of service.\u201cThe more routers are compromised, the more sources of powerful data collection \u2014 and avenues for further attacks \u2014 become available to attackers,\u201d according to the analysis, which raised the specter of \u201ceternal botnets.\u201d\u201cOnce an IoT device is infected with malware, an attacker can have unrestricted internet access for downloading and deploying more stages of malware for reconnaissance, espionage, proxying or anything else that the attacker wants to do,\u201d researchers warned. \u201cThe underlying operating systems for the majority of IoT devices is Linux, which is also used by many powerful systems tools. This can allow attackers to add anything else that they might need to complete their attacks.\u201dGiven Sandworm\u2019s track record, it\u2019s wise to expect the worst, the firm noted.\u201cSandworm\u2019s previous high-profile victims and their attacks\u2019 substantial impact on these organizations are particularly worrying \u2014 even more so for a group that quickly learns from past errors, comes back stronger time and time again, and for whom international repercussions seem minimal at best,\u201d researchers said.A Few Technical Specifics on a New Botnet VariantCoded in the C language, Cyclops Blink relies on hard-coded TCP ports to communicate with a range of command-and-control servers (C2s), according to the analysis. For each port, it creates a rule in the Netfilter Linux kernel firewall to allow output communication to it.Once it\u2019s made contact, the malware initializes an OpenSSL library, and its core component then cranks up operations for a series of hard-coded modules.\u201cCommunication with the modules is performed via pipes,\u201d according to Trend Micro. \u201cFor each hard-coded module, the malware creates two pipes before executing them in their own child processes.\u201dThe malware then pushes various parameters to the modules, which in turn respond with data that the core component encrypts with OpenSSL functions before sending it to the C2 server.\u201cThe data is encrypted using AES-256 in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode with a randomly generated 256-bit key and 128-bit initialization vector (IV). It is then encrypted using a hard-coded RSA-2560 (320-bit) public key unique to each sample,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThe C2 server must have the corresponding RSA private key to decrypt the data.\u201dResearchers added, \u201cTo send data to the C2 server, the core component performs a TLS handshake with a randomly chosen C2 server at a random TCP port, both of which are from a hard-coded list.\u201dInitially, the core component sends a list of supported commands to the C2 server and then waits to receive one of the commands back. These can be aimed at the core component itself or to one of its modules, according to the writeup.If a command targets the core component, it can be one of the following:Terminate the programBypass the data-sending interval and send data to C2 servers immediatelyAdd a new C2 server to the list in memorySet time to send the next packet to the C2 serverSet time to send the next packet to the C2 serverAdd a new module (an ELF file should be received following the command)Reload the malwareSet the local IP address parameterSet a new worker IDSet an unknown byte valueResend configuration to all running modulesAs for the commands meant for the modules, the latest variant studied by Trend Micro now includes \u201cAsus (0x38),\u201d meant to activate a brand-new module built to infect ASUS routers.Targeting ASUS RoutersThe ASUS module is built to access and replace a router\u2019s flash memory, thus enslaving it to the botnet, researchers explained.\u201cThis module can read and write from the devices\u2019 flash memory,\u201d they said. \u201cThe flash memory is used by these devices to store the operating system, configuration and all files from the file system.\u201dCyclops Blink reads 80 bytes from the flash memory, writes it to the main pipe, and then waits for a command with the data needed to replace the content.\u201cAs the flash memory content is permanent, this module can be used to establish persistence and survive factory resets,\u201d researchers explained.A second module, straightforwardly called \u201csystem reconnaissance (0x08),\u201d is responsible for gathering various data from the infected device and sending it to the C2 server.Specifically, it harvests:The Linux version of the deviceInformation about the device\u2019s memory consumptionThe SSD storage informationThe content of the following files:\n\n/etc/passwd\n/etc/group\n/proc/mounts\n/proc/partitions\n\n/etc/passwd/etc/group/proc/mounts/proc/partitionsInformation about network interfacesA third module, \u201cfile download (0x0f),\u201d can download files from the internet using DNS over HTTPS (DoH).Trend Micro noted that ASUS is likely not the only new module that will emerge for the botnet. After all, Sandworm\u2019s previous botnet, VPNFilter, targeted a wide range of router vendors, including ASUS, D-Link, Huawei, Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, QNAP, TP-Link, Ubiquiti, UPVEL and ZDE.\u201cWe have evidence that other routers are affected too, but as of reporting, we were not able to collect Cyclops Blink malware samples for routers other than WatchGuard and ASUS,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cBased on our observation, we strongly believe that there are more targeted devices from other vendors. This malware is modular in nature, and it is likely that each vendor has different modules and architectures that were thought out well by the Cyclops Blink actors.\u201dHow to Defend Against Becoming a Botnet VictimLike with other botnets, organizations can protect themselves from Cyclops Blink attacks by falling back on basic security hygiene, Trend Micro noted, including the use of strong passwords, using a virtual private network (VPN), regular firmware patching and so on. \u00a0Most successful compromises are the result of default or weak password use or the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.If an organization\u2019s devices have been infected with Cyclops Blink, researchers said that the best course of action is to chuck the victimized router for a new one, given the malware\u2019s prodigious persistence capabilities.\u201cIt is best to get a new router,\u201d they explained. \u201cPerforming a factory reset might blank out an organization\u2019s configuration, but not the underlying operating system that the attackers have modified. If a particular vendor has firmware updates that can address a Cyclops Blink attack or any other weakness in the system, organizations should apply these as soon as possible. However, in some cases, a device might be an end-of-life product and will no longer receive updates from its vendor. In such cases, an average user would not have the ability to fix a Cyclops Blink infection.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The Qakbot botnet is getting more dangerous, sinking its fangs into email threads and injecting malicious modules to pump up the core botnet\u2019s powers.On Thursday, Sophos published a deep dive into the botnet, describing how researchers have recently seen it spreading through email thread hijacking \u2013 an attack in which malware operators malspam replies to ongoing email threads.In a recent campaign, Qakbot has also been sucking up system info, Sophos said. \u201cThe botnet spreads through email thread hijacking and collects a wide range of profile information from newly infected machines, including all the configured user accounts and permissions, installed software, running services, and more,\u201d according to the writeup, after which the botnet downloads the malicious modules.The Qakbot malware code uses weird encryption to cover up the contents of its communications, but Sophos researchers managed to decrypt the malicious modules and to decode the botnet\u2019s command and control C2) system to figure out nterpret how Qakbot receives its marching orders.Beyond AnnoyingQakbot, aka QBot, QuackBot and Pinkslipbot, is a banking trojan that was first spotted in the wild 17 years ago, in 2007. Since its toddler days, it\u2019s become one of the most prevalent banking trojans found around the world.Though its main purpose is info-swiping \u2013 e.g., ripping off logins, passwords and more \u2013 the malware has picked up myriad other nasty habits: spying on financial operations, spreading and installing ransomware, keystroke logging, a backdoor functionality, and smooth moves to evade detection, including detecting its environment, self-updating, and cyptor/packer updates. It also fights back against being analyzed and debugged, be it by experts or automated tools.\u201cQakbot is a modular, multi-purpose botnet spread by email that has become increasingly popular with attackers as a malware delivery network, like Trickbot and Emotet,\u201d said Andrew Brandt, principal threat researcher at Sophos. \u201cSophos\u2019 deep analysis of Qakbot reveals the capture of detailed victim profile data, the botnet\u2019s ability to process complex sequences of commands, and a series of payloads to extend the functionality of the core botnet engine.\u201dIn a nutshell, Qakbot isn\u2019t your dad\u2019s commodity bot, Brandt said: \u201cThe days of thinking of \u2018commodity\u2019 bots as merely annoying are long gone.\u201dInfection Chain and PayloadsSophos analyzed a campaign in which the Qakbot botnet inserted malicious messages into existing email threads: messages that included a short sentence and a link to download a zip file containing a malicious Excel spreadsheet. The message asked the targeted user to \u201cenable content\u201d to activate the infection chain.Once the botnet infected a target, it scanned them in order to get a detailed profile that it then passed on up to the C2 server. Then, the botnet downloaded more \u2013 at least three \u2013 malicious modules.The payloads, which were injected into browsers, took the form of dynamic link libraries (DLL) that broadened the botnet\u2019s capabilities to include these unsavory tidbits:A module that injects password-stealing code into webpages,A module that performs network scans, collecting data about other machines in proximity to the infected computer, andA module that identified the addresses of a dozen SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) email servers and then tried to connect to each one and send spam.Qak Off, QakbotBrandt recommended that security teams need to take Qakbot infections seriously, by investigating every infection and scrubbing networks clean of \u201cevery trace\u201d of the multi-talented malware. Botnet infections are, after all, a known precursor for a ransomware attack, Brandt wrote.It\u2019s not just ransomware that sys admins have to brace for. There\u2019s also the prospect of botnet developers selling or leasing their access to your breached network, Brandt warned. \u201cFor example, Sophos has encountered Qakbot samples that deliver Cobalt Strike beacons directly to an infected host,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the Qakbot operators have used the infected computer they can transfer, lease out or sell access to these beacons to paying customers.\u201dSophos has tips on avoiding infection:Approach unusual or unexpected emails with caution, even when the messages appear to be replies to existing email threads. \u201cIn the Qakbot campaign investigated by Sophos, a potential red flag for recipients was the use of Latin phrases in URLs,\u201d Sophos advised.Security teams should check that the behavioral protections provided by their security technologies prevent Qakbot infections from taking hold. Network devices will also alert administrators if an infected user attempts to connect to a known C2 address or domain.Register Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event sked for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

That undesirable trophy likely goes to the 2.5 Tbps DDoS that hit Google in September 2017, sending 167 Mps to 180,000 exposed CLDAP, DNS, and SNMP servers that turned around and sent back big, choke-you packets.\u201cWhile ransom DDoS attacks are not new, they appear to be evolving and becoming more interesting with time and with each new phase,\u201d Imperva observed.Another threatening message, shown below, told \u201cwebops_geeks\u201d to inform their bosses that they\u2019d need to start coughing up 1 Bitcoin a day \u2013 worth the tidy sum of about USD $40K, as of Friday \u2013 if they wanted to stay online.

Russia made a show of busting up REvil in January, with its Federal Security Service (FSB) claiming to have raided gang hideouts; seized currency, cars and personnel; and neutralized REvil\u2019s infrastructure at the request of the United States. But as these things go, cybercrook gangs are like blobs of jelly: You squeeze one end, and the action pops up somewhere else as members join other cybercriminal gangs.REvil does have a history of DDoS ransomware, though. In October 2021, a British voice-over-IP (VoIP) firm \u2013 Voice Unlimited \u2013 was still recuperating a month after a series of apparent sustained DDoS attacks that were attributed to REvil.Threatening to Tank Victim\u2019s StocksThe next day, the attackers sent over 15 million requests to the same site, this time with a new message that warned the CEO that the attackers would eviscerate the company\u2019s stock price by \u201chundreds_of_millions_in_market_cap.\u201dMessage threatening the stock price.

Meris sucks its power out of the thousands of internet-of-things (IoT) devices that have been hijacked thanks to a years-old vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-14847, in MicroTik routers.\u201cAlthough CVE-2018-14847 was published a while ago, attackers can still take advantage of it,\u201d Imperva pointed out.And how.

Other targets for Meris in 2021 included cybersecurity media sites Krebs on Security and Infosecurity, as well as New Zealand banks, its post mail service and the country\u2019s MetService weather service.They\u2019re all cases in point for the fact that DDoS attacks shattered records in Q3.While the largest attack to hit Imperva\u2019s customer reached 2.5 Mrps, the company blocked over 64 million requests in under one minute, as shown in the graph below:Graph showing over 64 million requests blocked in under one minute.

Source: VirusTotal.Scrawny Code, Brawny MalwareAlien Labs only recently discovered that the BotenaGo source code had been uploaded to the wildly popular GitHub software development platform a month prior to when researchers discovered the malware to begin with: Specifically, it was uploaded on Oct. 16.The leak means that any malicious actor can use, modify and upgrade the malware, Caspi said, \u201cor even simply compile it as is and use the source code as an exploit kit, with the potential to leverage all BotenaGo\u2019s exploits to attack vulnerable devices.\u201dResearchers also found additional hacking tools, from several sources, collected in the same repository.Alien Labs called the malware source code \u201csimple yet efficient,\u201d able to carry out malware attacks with a grand total of a mere 2,891 lines of code (including empty lines and comments). In its November writeup, Alien Labs noted that BotenaGo, written in Google\u2019s open-source Golang programming language, could exploit 33 vulnerabilities for initial access.The malware is light, easy to use and powerful. BotenaGo\u2019s 2,891 lines of code are all that\u2019s needed for a malware attack, including, but not limited to, installing a reverse shell and a telnet loader used to create a backdoor to receive commands from its command-and-control (C2) operator.Caspi explained that BotenaGo has automatic setup of its 33 exploits, presenting an attacker a \u201cready state\u201d to attack a vulnerable target and infect it with an appropriate payload based on target type or operating system.The source code leaked to GitHub and depicted below features a \u201csupported\u201d list of vendors and software used by BotenaGo to target its exploits at a slew of routers and IoT devices.BotenaGo\u2019s available exploits for multiple vendors, as commented out on leaked source code.

History tells the tale: The Mirai botnet rocketed to prominence after its source code had similarly been uploaded to a hacking community forum in 2016, and later uploaded to GitHub along with details about its infrastructure, configuration and how to build it.\u201cToday, BotenaGo variants serve as a standalone exploit kit and as a spreading tool for other malware,\u201d he said. \u201cNow with its source code available to any malicious hacker, new malicious activity can be added easily to the malware. Alien Labs sees the potential for a significant increase in these malware variants, giving rise to potentially new malware families that could put millions of routers and IoT devices at risk of attack.\u201dHow to Make BotenaGo Go-Go-Go AwayAlien Labs researchers recommend three steps to keep this malware off devices:Maintain minimal exposure to the Internet on Linux servers and IoT devices and use a properly configured firewall;Install security and firmware upgrades from vendors, as soon as possible;And check your system for unnecessary open ports and suspicious processes.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.IoTMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) has disrupted the blockchain-enabled botnet known as Glupteba, which is made up of around 1 million compromised Windows and internet of things (IoT) devices.In tandem, Google also filed a lawsuit against the botnet\u2019s operators.Glupteba, already a formidable presence worldwide, grows at a rate of thousands of new devices per day, according to TAG. It spreads via fake pirate software, fake YouTube videos, malicious documents, traffic distribution systems and more, researchers said. Once installed, it sets about stealing users\u2019 credentials and data, mining cryptocurrencies on infected hosts, and setting up proxies to funnel other internet traffic through infected machines and routers.We want to know what your biggest cloud security concerns and challenges are, and how your company is dealing with them. Weigh in with our exclusive, anonymous\u00a0Threatpost Poll!\u201cAnd at any moment, the power of the Glupteba botnet could be leveraged for use in a powerful ransomware or distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack,\u201d Google noted in its lawsuit, shared with Threatpost on Tuesday.The botnet\u2019s operators also offer a slate of underground cybercrime-as-a-service offerings.\u201cWhile analyzing Glupteba binaries, our team identified a few containing a git repository URL: git.voltronwork[dot] com, researchers explained. \u201cThis finding sparked an investigation that led us to identify, with high confidence, multiple online services offered by the individuals operating the Glupteba botnet. These services include selling access to virtual machines loaded with stolen credentials (dont[.]farm), proxy access (awmproxy), and selling credit-card numbers (extracard) to be used for other malicious activities such as serving malicious ads and payment fraud on Google Ads.\u201dTo defang the beast, TAG disrupted \u201ckey command-and-control infrastructure so those operating Glupteba should no longer have control of their botnet \u2014 for now,\u201d the group\u2019s vice president of security Royal Hansen and general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado said in a Tuesday posting.The operation included terminating 63 million Google Docs used to distribute Glupteba, 1,313 Google accounts, 908 cloud projects and 870 Google Ads accounts; and, working with CloudFlare and others, taking down servers and placing warning interstitial pages in front of malicious domains.However, Hansen and Prado acknowledged that \u201cGlupteba\u2019s use of blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism is notable here \u2026 the decentralized nature of blockchain allows the botnet to recover more quickly from disruptions, making them that much harder to shut down.\u201dElaborating in a separate post, TAG researchers added that \u201cthe operators of Glupteba are likely to attempt to regain control of the botnet using a backup command-and-control mechanism that uses data encoded on the Bitcoin blockchain.\u201dSpecifically, the C2 uses HTTPS to communicate with infected devices; however, if for some reason that communication is disrupted, the infected systems can retrieve backup domains encrypted in the latest transaction from various Bitcoin wallet addresses.As the takedowns of Emotet and TrickBot showed, these types of networks do tend to resurge weeks or months after technical action is taken. So, as an extra layer of disruption, Google also filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Russian nationals Dmitry Starovikov and Alexander Filippov.The two are being sued for computer fraud and abuse, trademark infringement, violations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), tortious interference of business relationships, unjust enrichment, and other allegations.\u201cOur litigation was filed against the operators of the botnet, who we believe are based in Russia,\u201d Hansen and Prado wrote. \u201cWe also filed a temporary restraining order to bolster our technical disruption effort. If successful, this action will create real legal liability for the operators.\u201dThere\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "AT&T is taking action to take down a botnet that had set up shop inside its network, infecting 5,700 VoIP servers that route traffic from enterprise customers to upstream mobile providers.Researchers from Netlab, a network security division of Chinese tech giant Qihoo 360, first discovered what they characterized as a \u201cbrand-new botnet\u201d attacking Edgewater Networks devices, using a vulnerability in EdgeMarc Enterprise Session Border Controllers, tracked as CVE-2017-6079. Attackers had accessed vulnerable servers to install a modular malware strain that researchers dubbed \u201cEwDoor,\u201d researchers disclosed in a report published earlier this week.The flaw that attackers exploited is a hidden page in the EdgeMarc appliance that allows for user-defined commands such as specific iptables routes, etc., to be set. An attacker can use the page as a web shell to execute commands; however, the client side of the web application is not affected by the flaw.Netlab eventually identified the devices as belonging to AT&T, which confirmed the existence of the botnet to analyst firm Recorded Future\u2019s The Record.\u201cBased on the [fact that the] attacked devices are telephone-communication related, we presume that [the botnet\u2019s] main purpose is [distributed denial of service] DDoS attacks, and gathering of sensitive information, such as call logs,\u201d Netlab researchers wrote.AT&T said it is taking \u201csteps to mitigate\u201d the botnet, and so far the company has not found evidence that it has been weaponized, according to the report published on The Record Wednesday.\u201cWe have no evidence that customer data was accessed,\u201d AT&T said in an email, according to the report.Tracking a BotnetNetlab researchers observed EwDoor undergoing four updates between Oct. 27 and Nov. 20 as they tracked the behavior of the botnet. The current version of the malware includes six major functions: Self-updating, port scanning, file management, DDoS attack, reverse shell and arbitrary command execution, they said.Despite the size of the botnet, EwDoor\u2019s functionality is fairly straightforward, researchers said. After installation on an infected device, it collects device information, then performs a few common tasks such as establishing persistence and other functions.After this, the malware decrypts a tracker and obtains command-and-control (C2) by accessing the tracker, then finally reports the collected device information to C&C and executes its commands.One interesting aspect of the botnet and the servers that have been commandeered by attackers is that researchers found that there were about 100,000 IPs using the same SSL certificate. SSL certificates act as identities for devices and are used to validate who is connecting to them and if they are connecting to the right system.\u00a0\u201cWe are not sure how many devices corresponding to these IPs could be infected, but we can speculate that as they belong to the same class of devices the possible impact is real,\u201d researchers wrote.Wildcard SSL Certificates?Indeed, the discovery of so many IPs using the same certificates could signal that AT&T has a more systemic problem within its network that allowed for the creation of the botnet and could pave the way for other attacks, noted one security professional.\u201cUsing the same SSL certificate for multiple devices is roughly similar to\u00a0people making copies of the passport, which has only the family name and the whole extended family using the same passport,\u201d noted Murali Palanisamy, chief solutions officer for\u00a0AppViewX, in an email to Threatpost.\u00a0\u201cIt also typically suggests that the default certificate is not replaced or updated.\u201dCertificates like this are called wildcard certificates, he said, and they expose devices to \u201capplication-layer protocols allowing cross-protocol attacks\u201d (ALPACA), something that the NSA warned about recently.\u201cOne of the easiest ways to identify or fingerprint an application with default credentials is to check for default or same certificates\u00a0across multiple devices,\u201d Palanisamy explained. \u201cThis means either the device is not fully secured or configured with all the best practices.\u201dIf this is the case, AT&T will have to \u201curgently take action\u201d to secure any server or device exposed to an outside network to ensure that no one is accessing the network by exploiting unencrypted ports, he explained.\u201cThe organization will also have to reimage and secure thousands of devices and look at the exposure they\u00a0have and the back doors they have set up or accessed,\u201d Palanisamy added.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "Threat group FreakOut\u2019s Necro botnet has developed a new trick: infecting Visual Tools DVRs with a Monero miner. Juniper Threat Labs researchers have issued a report detailing new activities from FreakOut, also known as Necro Python and Python.IRCBot. In late September, the team noticed that the botnets started to target Visual Tools DVR VX16 4.2.28.0 models with cryptomining attacks. The devices are typically deployed as part of a professional-quality surveillance system. A command injection vulnerability was found in the same devices last July. Visual Tools has not yet responded to Threatpost\u2019s request for comment. \u201cThe script can run in both Windows and Linux environments,\u201d the Juniper report said. \u201cThe script has its own polymorphic engine to morph itself every execution which can bypass signature-based defenses. This works by reading every string in its code and encrypting it using a hardcoded key.\u201dFreakOut has been on the scene since at least January, exploiting recently identified and unpatched vulnerabilities to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and cryptomining attacks. Juniper reports that the threat actors have developed several iterations of the Necro bot, making steady improvements in its performance and persistence over the past several months. \u201cWe have noted a few changes on this bot from the previous version,\u201d the report said. \u201cFirst, it removed the SMB scanner which was observed in the May 2021 attack. Second, it changed the url that it injects to script files on the compromised system.\u201dNew DGA Functionality Helps Evade Detection The team explained that more recent versions of the Necro bot scrapped its previous reliance on a hardcoded URL for a domain generation algorithm (DGA) for added persistence. The new exploit has not yet been fully evaluated for a CVE, according to NIST, but a proof of concept is available through the Exploit Database. First the Necro bot scans for the target port: [22, 80, 443, 8081, 8081, 7001]. If detected, it will launch a XMRig \u2013 that\u2019s a high-performance Monero (XMR) miner \u2013 linked to this wallet: [45iHeQwQaunWXryL9YZ2egJxKvWBtWQUE4PKitu1VwYNUqkhHt6nyCTQb2dbvDRqDPXveNq94DG9uTndKcWLYNoG2uonhgH]The team added that the bot is also still actively trying to exploit these previously identified vulnerabilities: CVE-2020-15568 \u2013 TerraMaster TOS before 4.1.29CVE-2021-2900 \u2013 Genexis PLATINUM 4410 2.1 P4410-V2-1.28CVE-2020-25494 \u2013 Xinuos (formerly SCO) Openserver v5 and v6CVE-2020-28188 \u2013 TerraMaster TOS <= 4.2.06CVE-2019-12725 \u2013 Zeroshell 3.9.0Mounir Hahad, head of Juniper Threat Labs, told Threatpost that security teams need security that\u2019s equipped to handle DGA domain attempts. \u201cThe very existence of this kind of botnet highlights the need for a connected security approach where DNS security capabilities on the network identify connection attempts to DGA domains behind public dynamic DNS services, as well as routers, switches, and firewalls that are capable of immediately isolating the compromised host from the rest of the network,\u201d Hahad said.\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.HacksMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Technical details tied to a record-breaking distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against Russian internet behemoth Yandex are surfacing as the digital dust settles. A massive botnet, dubbed M\u0113ris, is believed responsible, flooding Yandex with millions of HTTP requests for webpages at the same time.This DDoS technique is called HTTP pipelining, where a browser requests a connection to a server and, without waiting for a response, sends multiple more requests. Those requests reportedly originated from networking gear made by MikroTik. Attackers, according to Qrator Labs, exploited a 2018 bug unpatched in more than 56,000 MikroTik hosts involved in the DDoS attack.According to Qrator, the M\u0113ris botnet delivered the largest attack against Yandex it has ever spotted (by traffic volume)\u00a0\u2013 peaking at 21.8 million requests per second (RPS). By comparison, infrastructure and website security firm Cloudflare reported that the \u201clargest ever\u201d DDoS attack occurred on August 19, with 17.2 million RPS.The Looming M\u0113ris MonsterResearchers have linked M\u0113ris to the August 19 DDoS attack tracked by Cloudflare. The Yandex attacks occurred between August 29 through September 5 \u2013 when the 21.8 million RPS attack occurred. Both are believed to be smaller precursor attacks by threat actors behind the M\u0113ris botnet, which have yet to utilize the enormous firepower.\n\u201cYandex\u2019 security team members managed to establish a clear view of the botnet\u2019s internal structure. L2TP [Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol] tunnels are used for internetwork communications. The number of infected devices, according to the botnet internals we\u2019ve seen, reaches 250,000,\u201d wrote Qrator in a Thursday blog post.L2TP is a protocol used to manage virtual private networks and deliver internet services. Tunneling facilitates the transfer of data between two private networks across the public internet.Yandex and Qrato launched an investigation into the attack and believe the M\u0113ris to be highly sophisticated.\u201cMoreover, all those [compromised MikroTik hosts are] highly capable devices, not your typical IoT blinker connected to Wi-Fi \u2013 here we speak of a botnet consisting of, with the highest probability, devices connected through the Ethernet connection \u2013 network devices, primarily,\u201d researchers wrote.Early Warnings Ignored?The technical attack specifics include the exploitation of a 2018 vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-14847. Tenable Research warned at the time of its disclosure that the bug needed to be taken extremely seriously, because a newly found hack technique allowed for remote code execution on MikroTik edge and consumer routers.\u201cWe are now able to show how an attacker can use it to get root shell on a system. It uses CVE-2018-14847 to leak the admin credentials first and then an authenticated code path gives us a back door,\u201d Tenable told Threatpost in 2018.While MikroTik patched CVE-2018-14847 back then, Tenable has now revealed that only approximately 30 percent of vulnerable modems have been patched, which leaves approximately 200,000 routers vulnerable to attack. MikroTik\u2019s RouterOS powers its business-grade RouterBOARD brand, as well as ISP/carrier-grade gear from the vendor.Qrato recent analysis of the DDoS attack revealed that the compromised hosts each had open ports 2000 (Bandwidth test server) and 5678 (Mikrotik Neighbor Discovery Protocol). Researchers reported 328,723 active hosts on the internet replying to the TCP probe on port 5678.Mitigating a MonsterWhile patching MikroTik devices is the most ideal mitigation to combat future M\u0113ris attacks, researchers also recommended blacklisting.\u201cSince those [M\u0113ris] attacks are not spoofed, every victim sees the attack origin as it is. Blocking it for a while should be enough to thwart the attack and not disturb the possible end user,\u201d wrote researchers.\u201c[It\u2019s] unclear how the\u2026owners for the M\u0113ris botnet would act in the future \u2013 they could be taking advantage of the compromised devices, taking 100 percent of its capacity (both bandwidth and processor-wise) into their hands. In this case, there is no other way other than blocking every consecutive request after the first one, preventing answering the pipelined requests.\u201dIt\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

        "raw text": "A recently developed botnet named \u201cSimps\u201d has emerged from the cyber-underground to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on gaming targets and others, using internet of things (IoT) nodes. It\u2019s part of the toolset used by the Keksec cybercrime group, researchers said.According to the Uptycs\u2019 threat research team, Simps was first seen in April being dropped on IoT devices by the Gafgyt botnet. Gafgyt (a.k.a. Bashlite) is a Linux-based botnet that was first uncovered in 2014. It targets vulnerable IoT devices like Huawei routers, Realtek routers and ASUS devices, which it then uses to launch large-scale DDoS attacks and download next-stage payloads to infected machines. It recently added new exploits for initial compromise, for Huawei, Realtek and Dasan GPON devices.In the current campaign, Gafgyt infects Realtek (CVE-2014-8361) and Linksys endpoints, and then fetches Simps. Simps itself then uses Mirai and Gafgyt modules for DDoS functionality, according to the analysis, released on Wednesday.Another variant of the attack uses shell scripts for downloading Simps.YouTube, Discord Simps DiscussionsThe shell script and Gafgyt can deploy various next-stage Simps payloads for several Linux-based architectures, researchers noted, using the Wget utility. Wget is a legitimate software package for retrieving files from web servers using HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPSa.Once the Simps binary executes, it drops a log file that records the fact that the target device is infected, and connects to the command-and-control server (C2).The infection logs share commonalities, which allowed the researchers to search for references to them across the broader web. This led to the discovery that the Simps author maintains a YouTube channel to offer demonstrations of the botnet\u2019s functionality, and a Discord server to host discussions about the malware.\u201cThe botnet might be in the early stages of development because of the presence of the log file after execution,\u201d researchers said, noting that leaving behind an easily discoverable artifact like that isn\u2019t best practice for those trying to stay under the radar.In any event, they identified a YouTube video created by a user named \u201citz UR0A,\u201d entitled \u201cSimps Botnet\ud83d\ude08, Slamming!!!\u201d \u2013 dating from April 24.The YouTube link also contained a Discord server link for \u201cUR0A\u201d, which was also present in the infection log, the analysis found.\u201cThe Discord server contained several discussions around DDoS activities and botnets carrying different names,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cOne binary we identified in a chat conversation named gay.x86 displayed a message that \u2018the system is pawned by md5hashguy.'\u201dAttribution to KeksecThanks to certain Discord server messages, Uptycs attributed the activity to the Keksec group (a.k.a. Kek Security), which is a prolific threat group known for exploiting vulnerabilities to invade multiple architectures with polymorphic tools (these can include Linux and Windows payloads, and custom Python malware).It\u2019s constantly adding to its arsenal; in January, it was seen deploying the FreakOut Linux botnet malware, which does port scanning, information gathering, and data packet and network sniffing, along with DDoS and cryptomining.\u201cThe group is actively constructing IRC botnets for the purposes of DDoS operations and cryptojacking campaigns using both Doge and Monero,\u201d according to a recent Lacework analysis of the group.As evidence for Simps attribution, Uptycs discovered that one of the Discord messages contained a Gafgyt malware sample that contained an \u201cInfected By Simps Botnet ;)\u201d message.\u201cThis malware dropped a file named \u2018keksec.infected.you.log,\u2019 that contained a message \u2018you\u2019ve been infected by urmommy, thanks for joining keksec.\u201dAlso, Gafgyt is one of Keksec\u2019s most-favored tools, according to past analysis, and the group is known for mashing up its code with other binaries to create Franken-malware. For instance, Keksec also operates HybridMQ-keksec, a botnet created by combining and modifying the source code of Mirai and Gafgyt, Uptycs pointed out.In the case of Simps, the binaries notably contain modules for launching DDoS attacks against gaming platforms like the Valve Source Engine and OVH. These were also seen in a variant of Gafgyt used by Keksec that targeted Huawei and Asus routers and killed its rival IoT botnets.How Enterprises Can Protect Against BotnetsUptycs recommended a few measures for enterprise users and administrators to identify and protect against botnet attacks:Regularly monitor the suspicious processes, events, and network traffic spawned on the execution of any untrusted binary/scripts.Always be cautious in executing shell scripts from unknown or untrusted sources.Keep systems and firmware updated with the latest releases and patches.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "The Lemon Duck cryptocurrency-mining botnet has added the ProxyLogon group of exploits to its bag of tricks, targeting Microsoft Exchange servers.That\u2019s according to researchers at Cisco Talos, who said that the cybercrime group behind Lemon Duck has also added the Cobalt Strike attack framework into its malware toolkit and has beefed up anti-detection capabilities. On the latter front, it\u2019s using fake domains on East Asian top-level domains (TLDs) to hide command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.Lemon Duck targets victims\u2019 computer resources to mine the Monero virtual currency, with self-propagating capabilities and a modular framework that allows it to infect additional systems that become part of the botnet. It has been active since at least the end of December 2018, and Cisco Talos calls it \u201cone of the more complex\u201d mining botnets, with several interesting tricks up its sleeve.For instance, Lemon Duck has at least 12 different initial-infection vectors \u2013 more than most malware, with Proxylogon exploits only the latest addition. Its existing capabilities ranged from Server Message Block (SMB) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) password brute-forcing; targeting the RDP BlueKeep flaw (CVE-2019-0708) in Windows machines; targeting internet-of-things devices with weak or default passwords; and exploiting vulnerabilities in Redis (an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache and message broker) and YARN Hadoop (a resource-management and job-scheduling technology) in Linux machines.\u201cSince April 2021, Cisco Talos has observed updated infrastructure and new components associated with the Lemon Duck that target unpatched Microsoft Exchange Servers and attempt to download and execute payloads for Cobalt Strike DNS beacons,\u201d according to an analysis released Friday.Cisco Talos researchers previously observed an increase in DNS requests connected with Lemon Duck\u2019s C2 and mining servers last August, with the attacks mainly targeting Egypt, India, Iran, the Philippines and Vietnam. In the latest rash of attacks, which began in April, the group has changed up its geographic targets to focus primarily on North America, followed by Europe and Southeast Asia, and a handful of victims in Africa and South America.Targeting Exchange Servers with Monero-MiningProxyLogon consists of four flaws (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065) that can be chained together to create a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) exploit \u2013 meaning that attackers can take over servers without knowing any valid account credentials. This gives them access to email communications and the opportunity to install a web shell for further exploitation within the environment, such as the deployment of ransomware.The highly publicized exploit chain suffered a barrage of attacks from advanced persistent threat (APT) groups to infect systems with everything from ransomware to info-stealers, and now financially motivated groups are getting in on the action too.In Lemon Duck\u2019s case, once the Exchange servers are compromised, it executes various system commands using the Windows Control Manager (sc.exe), including copying two .ASPX files named \u201cwanlins.aspx\u201d and \u201cwanlin.aspx.\u201d\u201cThese files are likely web shells and were copied from C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\aspnet_client\\, a known directory where a majority of the web shells were initially observed following Microsoft\u2019s release of details related to Hafnium activity,\u201d according to the research.Next, Cisco Talos researchers observed the echo command being used to write code associated with a web shell into the previously created ASPX files, and the modification of the Windows registry to enable RDP access to the system.\u201cIn this case, several characteristics matched portions of code associated with known China Chopper variants identified days after the Exchange Server vulnerabilities were publicized,\u201d they noted.Other interesting aspects of the latest campaign include the fact that Lemon Duck executes a PowerShell script that downloads and executes an additional malware payload, \u201csyspstem.dat,\u201d which includes a \u201ckiller\u201d module which contains a hardcoded list of competing cryptocurrency miners that Lemon Duck disables. The module is run every 50 minutes.Also, the malware is now leveraging Certutil to download and execute two new malicious PowerShell scripts, researchers said. Certutil is a native Windows command-line program that is installed as part of Certificate Services. It is used to verify and dump Certificate Authority (CA) information, get and publish new certificate revocation lists, and so on.One of the PowerShell scripts, named \u201cdn.ps1,\u201d attempts to uninstall multiple antivirus products, and also retrieves a Cobalt Strike payload.Cobalt Strike Added to the MixCobalt Strike is a penetration-testing tool that\u2019s commercially available. It sends out beacons to detect network vulnerabilities. When used for its intended purpose, it simulates an attack. Threat actors have since figured out how to\u00a0turn it against networks to exfiltrate data, deliver malware and create fake C2 profiles that look legitimate and avoid detection.Lemon Duck\u2019s Cobalt Strike payload is configured as a Windows DNS beacon and attempts to communicate with the C2 server using a DNS-based covert channel, researchers noted. The beacon then communicates with this specific subdomain to transmit encoded data via DNS A record query requests.\u201cThis represents a new TTP for Lemon Duck, and is another example of their reliance on offensive security tools (OSTs), including Powersploit\u2019s reflective loader and a modified Mimikatz, which are already included as additional modules and components of Lemon Duck and used throughout the typical attack lifecycle,\u201d according to Cisco Talos.Lemon Duck\u2019s Fresh Anti-Detection TricksWhile Lemon Duck casts a wide net in terms of victimology, it has been exclusively using websites within the TLDs for China (\u201c.cn\u201d), Japan (\u201c.jp\u201d) and South Korea (\u201c.kr\u201d) for its C2 activities since February, rather than the more familiar \u201c.com\u201d or \u201c.net.\u201d\u201cConsidering these [TLDs] are most commonly used for websites in their respective countries and languages\u2026this may allow the threat actor to more effectively hide C2 communications among other web traffic present in victim environments,\u201d according to Cisco Talos. \u201cDue to the prevalence of domains using these [TLDs], web traffic to the domains\u2026may be more easily attributed as noise to victims within these countries.\u201dDuring the Lemon Duck infection process, PowerShell is used to invoke the \u201cGetHostAddresses\u201d method from the .NET runtime class \u201cNet.Dns\u201d to obtain the current IP address for an attacker-controlled domain, researchers explained.\u201cThis IP address is combined with a fake hostname hardcoded into the PowerShell command and written as an entry to the Windows hosts file,\u201d they said. \u201cThis mechanism allows name resolution to continue even if DNS-based security controls are later deployed, as the translation is now recorded locally and future resolution requests no longer rely upon upstream infrastructure such as DNS servers. This may allow the adversary to achieve longer-term persistence once operational in victim environments.\u201dCryptojackers Take Notice of ProxyLogonLemon Duck is not the first cryptomining malware to add ProxyLogon to its arsenal. For instance, another cryptojacking group was seen in mid-April doing the same thing.That bad code was fairly simple, but also in mid-April a heretofore little-seen Monero-mining botnet dubbed Prometei began exploiting two of the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities in ProxyLogon. This malware is also highly complex and sophisticated, Cybereason researchers noted at the time. While cryptojacking is its current game, researchers warned that Prometei (the Russian word for Prometheus, the Titan god of fire from Greek mythology) gives attackers complete control over infected machines, which makes it capable of doing a wide range of damage.The threat will likely continue to evolve, Cisco Talos researchers said. They also observed domains linked to Lemon Duck and another cryptocurrency miner, DLTMiner, used in relation to Microsoft Exchange attacks where ransomware was also deployed.\u201cAt this time, there doesn\u2019t appear to be a link between the Lemon Duck components observed there and the reported ransomware (TeslaRVNG2),\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThis suggests that given the nature of the vulnerabilities targeted, we are likely to continue to observe a range of malicious activities in parallel, using similar exploitation techniques and infection vectors to compromise systems. In some cases, attackers may take advantage of artifacts left in place from prior compromises, making distinction more difficult.\u201dMeanwhile, it\u2019s clear that the threat actor behind Lemon Duck is continuously evolving its approach to maximize the ability to achieve its mission objectives, researchers noted.\u201cLemon Duck continues to launch campaigns against systems around the world, attempting to leverage infected systems to mine cryptocurrency and generate revenue for the adversary behind this botnet,\u201d they concluded. \u201cThe use of new tools like Cobalt Strike, as well as the implementation of additional obfuscation techniques throughout the attack lifecycle, may enable them to operate more effectively for longer periods within victim environments. \u2026 Organizations should remain vigilant against this threat, as it will likely continue to evolve.\u201dJoin Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d \u2013 a LIVE roundtable event on\u00a0Wed, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "A heretofore little-seen botnet dubbed Prometei is taking a page from advanced persistent threat (APT) cyberattackers: The malware is exploiting two of the Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities collectively known as ProxyLogon, in order to drop a Monero cryptominer on its targets.It\u2019s also highly complex and sophisticated, researchers noted. While cryptojacking is its current game, Cybereason researchers warned that Prometei (the Russian word for Prometheus, the Titan god of fire from the Greek mythology) gives attackers complete control over infected machines, which makes it capable of doing a wide range of damage.Download \u201cThe Evolution of Ransomware\u201d to gain valuable insights on emerging trends amidst rapidly growing attack volumes. Click above to hone your defense intelligence!\u201cIf they wish to, they can steal information, infect the endpoints with other malware or even collaborate with ransomware gangs by selling the access to the infected endpoints,\u201d Cybereason researcher Lior Rochberger noted in an analysis released Thursday. \u201c[And] since cryptomining can be resource-hogging, it can affect the performance and stability of critical servers and endpoints, ultimately affecting business continuity.\u201dThe report noted that Cybereason has recently seen wide swathes of Prometei attacks on a variety of industries, including construction, finance, insurance, manufacturing, retail, travel and utilities. Geographically speaking, it has been observed infecting networks in the U.S., U.K. and many other European countries, as well as countries in South America and East Asia. It was also observed that the threat actors appear to be explicitly avoiding infecting targets in former Soviet-bloc countries.\u201cThe victimology is quite random and opportunistic rather than highly targeted, which makes it even more dangerous and widespread,\u201d Rochberger said.Exploiting Microsoft Exchange Security BugsProxyLogon consists of four flaws that can be chained together to create a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) exploit \u2013 meaning that attackers can take over servers without knowing any valid account credentials. This gives them access to email communications and the opportunity to install a web shell for further exploitation within the environment, such as the\u00a0deployment of ransomware, or as in this case, cryptominers.Microsoft last month warned that the bugs were being\u00a0actively exploited\u00a0by the Hafnium advanced persistent threat (APT); after that, other researchers said that\u00a010 or more additional APTs\u00a0were also using them.When it comes to Prometei, researchers have observed attacks against companies in North America making use of the ProxyLogon bugs tracked as CVE-2021-27065 and CVE-2021-26858. Both are post-authentication arbitrary file-write vulnerabilities in Exchange; once authenticated with an Exchange server, attackers could write a file to any path on the server \u2013 thus achieving RCE.The attackers use the vulnerabilities to install and execute the China Chopper web shell, according to Rochberger. They then use China Chopper to launch a PowerShell, which in turn downloads a payload from an attacker-controlled URL. That payload is then saved and executes, which ultimately starts the Prometei botnet execution.\u201cPrometei is a modular and multistage cryptocurrency botnet that was first discovered in July 2020 which has both Windows and Linux versions,\u201d explained Rochberger, who added that the botnet could extend back to 2016. \u201cThe latest versions of Prometei now provide the attackers with a sophisticated and stealthy backdoor that supports a wide range of tasks that make mining Monero coins the least of the victims\u2019 concerns.\u201dPrometei Under the HoodThe first module of the botnet, zsvc.exe, copies itself into C:\\Windows with the name \u201csqhost.exe,\u201d and then creates a firewall rule that will allow sqhost.exe to create connections over HTTP, according to the research. It also sets a registry key for persistence, and creates several other registry keys for later command-and-control (C2) communications by additional modules.\u201cSqhost.exe is the main bot module, complete with backdoor capabilities that support a wide range of commands,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cSqhost.exe is able to parse the prometei.cgi file from four different hardcoded C2 servers. The file contains the command to be executed on the machine. The commands can be used as standalone native OS commands\u2026or can be used to interact with the other modules of the malware.\u201dIt also controls the XMRig cryptominer that the malware installs on the machine, Cybereason noted. The commands on offer include the ability to execute a program or open a file; start or stop the mining process; download files; gather system information; check if a specific port is open; search for specific files or extensions; and update the malware \u2013 among other things.\u201cThe malware authors are able to add more modules and expand their capabilities easily, and potentially even shift to another payload objective, more destructive than just mining Monero,\u201d Rochberger warned.The report noted that the execution of the malware also includes two other \u201ctree processes:\u201d cmd.exe and wmic.exe.Wmic.exe is used to perform reconnaissance commands, including gathering the last time the machine was booted up, the machine model and more. Meanwhile Cmd.exe is used to block certain IP addresses from communicating with the machine.\u201cWe assess that those IP addresses are used by other malware, potentially miners, and the attackers behind Prometei wanted to ensure that all the resources of the network are available just for them,\u201d Rochberger explained.Lateral Malware Movement: Additional Malicious ModulesPrometei uses different techniques and tools, ranging from Mimikatz to the EternalBlue and BlueKeep exploits, along with other tools that all work together to propagate across the network, according to the analysis. To carry all of this out, the main botnet module downloads additional modules, including four main components:exeexe and an archived file, Netwalker.7z (7zip is used to extract the files in the archive)exeexeExchdefender masquerades as a made-up program called \u201cMicrosoft Exchange Defender.\u201d It constantly checks the files within a program files directory known to be used to host web shells, looking for one file in particular, according to Cybereason.\u201cThe malware is specifically interested in the file \u2018ExpiredPasswords.aspx\u2019 which was reported to be the name used to obscure the HyperShell backdoor used by APT34 (aka. OilRig),\u201d Rochberger said. If the file exists, the malware immediately deletes it. Our assessment is that this tool is used to \u201cprotect\u201d the compromised Exchange Server by deleting potential WebShells so Prometei will remain the only malware using its resources.\u201dThe Netwalker.7z archive meanwhile is password-protected, using the password \u201chorhor123.\u201d The archive contains the following files: Nethelper2.exe, Nethelper4.exe, Windrlver.exe, a few DLLs,a copy of RdpcIip.exe and a few DLLs used by the bot components.RdcIip.exe is a key component of the malware, used for harvesting credentials and spreading laterally across the network, Rochberger explained. It also tries to propagate within the network environment by brute-forcing usernames and passwords using a built-in list of common combinations, he said.If that doesn\u2019t work, it turns to the SMB shared-drive exploit EternalBlue to execute a shell code for installing the main bot module Sqhost.exe. To use the exploit, the malware downgrades the SMB protocol to SMB1, which is vulnerable to it. Cybereason also observed the module using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) exploit BlueKeep.Interestingly, RdpcIip also can coordinate other components of the bot such as Windlver.exe, which is an OpenSSH and SSLib-based software that the attackers created so they can spread across the network using SSH, the report noted.\u201c[RdpcIip] has huge (trust us, huge) functionality with different branches with the main purpose being to interact with other components of the malware and make them work all together,\u201d Rochberger said.And finally, Miwalk.exe is a customized version of the Mimikatz credential-finding tool that RdpcIip.exe launches. The output is saved in text files and used by RdpcIip as it tries to validate the credentials and spread, according to the analysis.Taking a Page from APTsThe group behind Prometei is financially motivated and operated by Russian-speaking individuals but is not backed by a nation-state, according to Cybereason. Nonetheless, the malware\u2019s sophistication and rapid incorporation of ProxyLogon exploits shows advanced capabilities that could make the botnet a serious danger in terms of espionage, information theft, follow-on malware and more, Rochberger warned.\u201cThreat actors in the cybercrime community continue to adopt APT-like techniques and improve the efficiency of their operations,\u201d he explained. \u201cPrometei is a complex and multistage botnet that, due to its stealth and wide range of capabilities, puts the compromised network at great risk\u2026The threat actors rode the wave of the recently discovered flaws and exploited them in order to penetrate targeted networks.

        "raw text": "Several variants of the Gafgyt Linux-based botnet malware family have incorporated code from the infamous Mirai botnet, researchers have discovered.Gafgyt (a.k.a. Bashlite) is a\u00a0botnet that was first uncovered in 2014. It targets vulnerable internet of things (IoT) devices like Huawei routers, Realtek routers and ASUS devices, which it then uses to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It also often uses known vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-17215 and CVE-2018-10561 to download next-stage payloads to infected devices.The latest variants have now incorporated several Mirai-based modules, according to research from Uptycs released Thursday, along with new exploits. Mirai variants and its code re-use have become more voluminous since the source code for the IoT botnet was released\u00a0in October 2016.The capabilities nicked from Mirai include various methods to carry out DDoS attacks, according to the research:HTTP flooding, in which the botnet sends a large number of HTTP requests to a targeted server to overwhelm it;UDP flooding, where the botnet sends several UDP packets to a victim server as a means of exhausting it;Various TCP flood attacks, which exploit a normal three-way TCP handshake the victim server receives a heavy number of requests, resulting in the server becoming unresponsive;And an STD module, which sends a random string (from a hardcoded array of strings) to a particular IP address.Code comparison for the HTTP DDoS module between Gafgyt and Mirai. Click to enlarge. Source: Uptycs.Meanwhile, the latest versions of Gafgyt contain new approaches for achieving initial compromise of IoT devices, Uptycs found; this is the first step in turning infected devices into bots to later perform DDoS attacks on specifically targeted IP addresses. These include a Mirai-copied module for Telnet brute-forcing, and additional exploits for existing vulnerabilities in Huawei, Realtek and GPON devices.The Huawei exploit (CVE-2017-17215) and the Realtek exploit (CVE-2014-8361) are both used for remote code execution (RCE), to fetch and download the Gafgyt payload, according to the analysis.\u201cThe Gafgyt malware binary embeds RCE exploits for Huawei and Realtek routers, by which the malware binary, using \u2018wget\u2019 command, fetches the payload,\u201d according to Uptycs. \u201c[It] gives the execution permission to payload using \u2018chmod\u2019 command, [and] executes the payload.\u201dThe GPON exploit (CVE-2018-10561) is used for authentication bypass in vulnerable Dasan GPON routers; here, the malware binary follows the same process, but can also remove the payload on command.\u201cThe IP addresses used for fetching the payloads were generally the open directories where malicious payloads for different architectures were hosted by the attacker,\u201d researchers added.IoT Botnet Variants AboundIoT botnets like Gafgyt are constantly evolving. For instance, researchers in March discovered what they said is the first variant of the Gafgyt botnet family to cloak its activity using the Tor network.Mirai hasn\u2019t disappeared either: a new variant of the botnet was recently discovered targeting a slew of vulnerabilities in unpatched D-Link, Netgear and SonicWall devices. Since mid-February, the variant has been targeting six known vulnerabilities \u2013 and three previously unknown ones \u2013 in order to infect systems and add them to a botnet.It\u2019s only the latest variant of Mirai\u00a0to come to light. Last year, a version dubbed Mukashi was seen taking advantage of a pre-authentication command-injection vulnerability found in Zyxel NAS storage devices.\u201cMalware authors may not always innovate, and researchers often discover that malware authors copy and re-use leaked malware source code,\u201d Uptycs researchers said.To protect against these kinds of botnet infections, users should regularly monitor for suspicious processes, events and network traffic spawned on the execution of any untrusted binary, researchers recommended. And, users should keep all systems and firmware updated with the latest releases and patches.Ever wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums?

        "raw text": "Researchers are warning a new botnet is recycling the Mirai malware framework and is now targeting Android devices in order to launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.The botnet is dubbed Matryosh (after a Matryoshka Russian nesting doll) due to many of its functions being \u201cnested\u201d in layers, researchers said. The botnet propagates through the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) interface. This is a command-line utility that is included in Google\u2019s Android software development kit (SDK). ADB allows developers to communicate with devices remotely, to execute commands and to fully control the device.Also of note, Matryosh uses the Tor network to cloak its malicious activity and prevent command server takedowns.\u201cThe changes at the network communication level indicates that its authors wanted to implement a mechanism to protect C2,\u201d said researchers with 360 Netlab\u00a0this week. \u201cDoing this will bring some difficulties to static analysis or simple IOC simulator.\u201dAndroid Debug Bridge Used For Botnet PropagationADB is completely unauthenticated \u2013 but in order to abuse it attackers would need to first enable the Debug Bridge on the device. However, many vendors have shipped products with the Android Debug Bridge enabled.This means that the feature is listening on port 5555 and enables anyone to connect with affected devices over the internet. Researchers did not specify which vendors\u00a0leave the feature on in their Android devices by default. Android devices can vary from smartphones to televisions.\u201cThis is highly problematic as it allows anybody \u2014 without any password \u2014 to remotely access these devices as \u2018root\u2019 \u2014 the administrator mode \u2014 and then silently install software and execute malicious functions,\u201d security researcher Kevin Beaumont has previously written about ADB. Beyond Matryosh, many botnets have leveraged this issue \u2013 including ADB.Miner.Matryosh: A Mirai Botnet CopycatResearchers first discovered Matryosh in a suspicious ELF file on Jan. 25. Anti-virus software detectors labeled the file as Mirai; however, upon closer inspection researchers found that the network traffic of the file did not match Mirai\u2019s characteristics. That\u2019s because Matryosh reuses Mirai\u2019s framework.Mirai is an infamous botnet most widely known for its massive DDoS attack against DNS provider Dyn in 2016, which crippled Internet service on the East Coast of the United States and took down several popular services (such as Netflix).In 2016, Mirai\u2019s alleged author released its source code \u2013 making it easier for copycats to\u00a0launch their own Mirai variants.New Botnet Features in MatryoshResearchers noted that Matryosh\u2019s cryptographic design \u201chas some novelty\u201d \u2013 but still falls into the Mirai single-byte XOR pattern. This is a downfall for the botnet because it is easily flagged by anti-virus software systems as Mirai, they said.Beyond this, the botnet has no integrated scanning features or vulnerability exploitation modules, researchers noted.What does stand out about the botnet is its use of Tor proxies, which is obtained from remote hosts via a DNS TXT record (a record that stores text notes on a DNS server).\u201cThe function of Matryosh is relatively simple, when it runs on [the] infected device, it renames the process \u2026 to confuse the user,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThen [it] decrypts the remote hostname and uses the DNS TXT request to obtain [the] TOR C2 and TOR proxy.\u201dAfter establishing a connection with the TOR proxy, the botnet communicates with the TOR C2 through the proxy and waits for the execution of the commands sent by C2.Who is Behind the Matryosh Botnet?Researchers speculate that the Moobot group is behind Matryosh. Moobot is a fairly new botnet family based on\u00a0Mirai botnet,\u00a0which targets internet of things (IoT) devices.Researchers mde these conclusions because Matryosh and Moobot\u2019s recent LeetHozer botnet branch have several similarities. For instance, they both use a model like the TOR C2, and their C2 port (31337) and attack method names are the same. Finally, the C2 command format is \u201chighly similar,\u201d said researchers.Matryosh is only one of many recent\u00a0botnet strains to surface, which over the past years have included Kaiji, Dark_Nexus, MootBot\u00a0and the DDG botnet.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World, sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "An innovative Linux-based cryptocurrency mining botnet has been uncovered, which exploits a disputed PostgreSQL remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerability to compromise database servers. The malware is unusual and completely novel in a host of ways, researchers said.According to researchers at Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42, the miner (dubbed \u201cPGMiner\u201d) exploits CVE-2019-9193 in PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, which is a popular open-source relational database management system for production environments. They said this could be the first-ever cryptominer that targets the platform.\u201cThe feature in PostgreSQL under exploitation is \u2018copy from program,\u2019 which was introduced in version 9.3 on Sept. 9, 2013,\u201d according to Unit 42 researchers, in a Thursday post. \u201cIn 2018, CVE-2019-9193 was linked to this feature, naming it as a vulnerability. However, the PostgreSQL community challenged this assignment, and the CVE has been labeled as \u2018disputed.'\u201dClick to register.They added, \u201cit is notable that malware actors have started to weaponize not only confirmed CVEs, but also disputed ones.\u201dThe feature allows a local or remote superuser to run shell script directly on the server, which is ripe for exploitation by cyberattackers. However, there\u2019s no risk for RCE as long as the superuser privilege is not granted to remote or untrusted users, and the access control and authentication system is properly configured, according to Unit 42. On the other hand, if it\u2019s not properly configured, PostgreSQL can allow RCE on the server\u2019s OS beyond the PostgreSQL software, \u201cif the attacker manages to own the superuser privilege by brute-forcing password or SQL injection,\u201d researchers said.The latter scenario is exactly what PGMiner accomplishes.Malware In-DepthThe malware sample that Unit 42 analyzed statically links to a client library (\u201clibpq postgresql\u201d), which is used to scan for target database servers to be brute forced.\u201cThe attacker scans port 5432 (0x1538), used by PostgreSQLql,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe malware randomly picks a public network range (e.g., 190.0.0.0, 66.0.0.0) in an attempt to perform RCE on the PostgreSQL server. With the user \u2018postgres,\u2019 which is the default user of the database, the attacker performs a brute-force attack iterating over a built-in list of popular passwords such as 112233 and 1q2w3e4r to crack the database authentication.\u201dAfter breaking in with superuser status, the malware uses CVE-2019-9193, a \u201ccopy from program\u201d feature, to download and launch the coin-mining scripts, according to the report.The miner takes a fileless approach, deleting the PostgreSQL table right after code launch, researchers said: PGMiner clears the \u201cabroxu\u201d table if it exists, creates a new \u201cabroxu\u201d table with a text column, saves the malicious payload to it, executes the payload on the PostgreSQL server and then clears the created table.Once installed, the malware uses curl to carry out tasks. Curl is a command-line tool to transfer data to or from a server. If curl isn\u2019t available on the victim\u2019s machine, researchers found that the malicious script tries multiple approaches to download the curl binary and add it to the execution paths, including: Direct installation from official package management utilities like apt-get and yum; downloading the static curl binary from GitHub; or downloading it using /dev/tcp in case the first two ways don\u2019t work.\u201cWhile the first two approaches are well-known, the third one is quite unique,\u201d according to Unit 42. \u201cWhat\u2019s more interesting is the target IP address: 94[.]237[.]85[.]89. It is connected to the domain newt[.]keetup[.]com. While its parent domain, keepup[.]com, seems like a legitimate business website, this particular subdomain is redirecting port 80 to 443, which is used to host a couchdb named newt. Although port 8080 is not open to the public, we believe it has been configured to allow Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).\u201dThe next step is connecting to the command-and-control server (C2) via SOCKS5 proxies. Then, PGMiner collects system information and sends it to the C2 for victim identification to determine which version of the coin-mining payload should be downloaded.\u201cAfter resolving the SOCKS5 proxy server IP address, PGMiner rotates through a list of folders to find the first one that allows permission to create a new file and update its attributes,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThis ensures the downloaded malicious payload can successfully execute on the victim\u2019s machine.\u201dThe next step, researchers said, is environment cleanup: It removes cloud security monitoring tools such as Aegis, and Qcloud monitor utilities such as Yunjing; checks for virtual machines; kills all other CPU intensive processes such as system updates; and kills competitor mining processes.The last task of course is to begin stealing CPU processor power to mine for Monero.\u201cDuring our analysis, we found that PGMiner constantly reproduces itself by recursively downloading certain modules,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201c[The] C2 server for this malware family is constantly updating. Different modules are distributed across different C2s.\u201dThe downloaded malware impersonates the tracepath process to hide its presence, researchers added.As for how successful or widespread the botnet is, the researchers said they observed this particular PGMiner sample attempting to connect to a mining pool for Monero, but it wasn\u2019t active. So, information about the malware\u2019s profit or footprint is unknown.To protect their servers, PostgreSQL users can remove the \u201cpg_execute_server_program\u201d privilege from untrusted users, which makes the exploit impossible, according to Unit 42. It\u2019s also possible to search and kill the \u201ctracepath\u201d process, and kill the processes whose process IDs (PIDs) have been tracked by the malware in \u201c/tmp/.X11-unix/\u201d.\u201cThe fact that PGMiner is exploiting a disputed vulnerability helped it remain unnoticed until we recently uncovered it,\u201d researchers noted, adding that it exhibits a raft of novel behavior.\u201cDuring our analysis, we observed new techniques, such as embedding victim identification in the request, impersonating a trusted process name, downloading curl binary via multiple approaches and more and aggressively killing all competitor programs,\u201d according to the firm. \u201cOther traits, such as the malware recursively downloading itself and frequently changing C2 addresses, also indicate PGMiner is still rapidly evolving.\u201dIt could easily evolve to target Windows and macOS as well, researchers added.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows; Limor Kessem, Executive Security Advisor, IBM Security; and Israel Barak, CISO at Cybereason,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

The DoJ said that between 2007 and 2019, Brovko worked closely with other cybercriminals to monetize vast troves of data that had been stolen by botnets.\u201cFor over a decade, Brovko participated in a scheme to gain access to Americans\u2019 personal and financial information, causing more than $100 million in intended loss,\u201d said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division, in a statement issued Monday.\u00a0 \u201cThis prosecution and the sentence imposed show the department\u2019s commitment to work with our international and state counterparts to bring cybercriminals to justice no matter where they are located.\u201dAccording to the DoJ, Brovko was an active member of several elite, online forums designed for Russian-speaking cybercriminals to gather and exchange their criminal tools and services.He specifically wrote software scripts used to parse botnet logs and performed manual searches of the data in order to extract \u201ceasily monetized\u201d information.Brovko also verified the validity of stolen account credentials, and assessed whether compromised financial accounts had enough funds to deem them \u201cworthwhile\u201d to use for conducting fraudulent transactions.\u201cAccording to court documents, Brovko possessed and trafficked over 200,000 unauthorized access devices during the course of the conspiracy,\u201d said the DoJ. \u201cThese access devices consisted of either personally identifying information or financial account details.\u201dBotnets, or networks of infected computers, continue to show new innovations, expanded scope and increased targeting.

        "raw text": "Researchers are warning of a recent dramatic uptick in the activity of the Lemon Duck cryptocurrency-mining botnet, which targets victims\u2019 computer resources to mine the Monero virtual currency.Click to Register!Researchers warn that Lemon Duck is \u201cone of the more complex\u201d mining botnets, with several interesting tricks up its sleeve. While the botnet has been active since at least the end of December 2018, researchers observed an increase in DNS requests connected with its command-and-control (C2) and mining servers since the end of August, in a slew of attacks centered on Asia (including ones targeting Iran, Egypt, Philippines, Vietnam and India).\u201cCisco Talos has identified activity in our endpoint telemetry associated with Lemon Duck cryptocurrency mining malware, affecting three different companies in the government, retail, and technology sectors,\u201d said researchers with Cisco Talos, in Tuesday research. \u201cWe observed the activity spanning from late March 2020 to present.\u201dMore recent attacks have included less-documented modules that are loaded by the main PowerShell component \u2013 including a Linux branch and a module allowing further spread by sending emails to victims with COVID-19 lures.Threatpost has reached out to researchers for further information about how many victims have been targeted and the extent to which the botnet\u2019s operators have profited off of the cryptomining attacks.Lemon DuckLemon Duck has at least 12 independent infection vectors \u2013 more than most malware. These capabilities range from\u00a0 Server Message Block (SMB) and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) password brute-forcing, sending emails with exploit attachments or targeting the RDP BlueKeep flaw (CVE-2019-0708) in Windows machines; or targeting vulnerabilities in Redis (an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache and message broker) and YARN Hadoop (a resource-management and job-scheduling technology) in Linux machines.Lemon Duck botnet August activity. Credit: Cisco TalosAfter the initial infection, a PowerShell loading script is downloaded, which utilizes the function \u201cbpu\u201d to disable Windows Defender real-time detection and put powershell.exe on the list of processes excluded from scanning.\u201cbpu\u201d also checks if the script is running with administrative privileges. If it is, the payload is downloaded and run using the Invoke-Expression cmdlet (a function that can be utilized for calling code within a script or building commands to be executed later). If not, it leverages existing system executables to launch the next stage.\u201cThis is a good starting point for analysis and retrieval of additional modules,\u201d said researchers. \u201cAlmost all PowerShell modules are obfuscated with four or five layers of obfuscation, likely generated by the Invoke-Obfuscation module. Although they are relatively easy to remove, they still slow down the analysis process and make detection using regular signatures more difficult.\u201dThese executable modules, which are downloaded and driven by the main module, communicates with the C2 server over HTTP.Modular FunctionalitiesThe modules include a main loader, which checks the level of user privileges and components relevant for mining, such as the type of the available graphic card (including GTX, Nvidia, GeForce, AMD and Radeon). If these GPUs are not detected, the loader downloads and runs the commodity XMRig CPU-based mining script.Other modules include a main spreading module (with what researchers say include \u201ca rather ambitious piece of code\u201d containing more than 10,000 lines of coding), a Python-based module packaged using Pyinstaller, and a killer module designed to disable known competing mining botnets.Lemon Duck also includes an email-spreading module. These spread emails using a mix of COVID-19-related subject lines and text, as well as other emotion-driven lures (such as an email subject \u201cWTF\u201d with the text \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?are you out of your mind!!!!!!!\u201d). These emails contain an infected attachments sent using Outlook automation to every contact in the affected user\u2019s address book.An example of an email sent by the Lemon Duck module. Credit: Cisco TalosLinux BranchResearchers also shed light on a less documented Linux branch of the Lemon Duck malware. These Lemon Duck bash scripts are executed after the attacker successful compromises a Linux host (via Redis, YARN or SSH).\u00a0There are two main bash scripts, said researchers: The first collects some data about the infected host and attempts to download a Linux version of the XMRig miner, before attempting to delete various system logs.\u00a0The second attempts to terminate and remove competing cryptocurrency miners already present on the system.\u201cThe script also attempts to terminate and uninstall processes related to Alibaba and Tencent cloud security agents. The script seems to be shared between several Linux-based cryptomining botnets,\u201d said researchers.Lemon Duck was previously spotted in 2020 in a campaign targeting printers, smart TVs and automated guided vehicles that depend on Windows 7. Researchers in February warned that the processor-intensive mining efforts are taking their toll on gear and triggering equipment malfunctions along with exposing devices to safety issues, disruption of supply chains and data loss.Defenders can stomp out the threat of cryptocurrency attacks by monitoring system behavior to spot any resource-sucking threats.\u201cCryptocurrency-mining botnets can be costly in terms of the stolen computing cycles and power consumption costs,\u201d they said. \u201cWhile organizations need to be focused on protecting their most valuable assets, they should not ignore threats that are not particularly targeted toward their infrastructure.\u201d\u00a0On October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "A freshly discovered botnet dubbed HEH by researchers is casting a wide net, looking to infect any and all devices that use Telnet on ports 23/2323. It\u2019s particularly destructive: It contains code that wipes all data from infected systems.Perhaps ironically, its operators also have a penchant for civil advocacy \u2013 a loading of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, visible to researchers during analysis, accompanies each infection.Click to Register!According to a 360Netlab analysis, samples of the bot are being found on a wide range of CPU architectures, including x86(32/64), ARM(32/64), MIPS(MIPS32/MIPS-III) and PPC \u2013 meaning it\u2019s infecting desktops, laptops, mobile and internet-of-things (IoT) devices. It\u2019s looking to brute-force Telnet credentials, and once in, it infects the target with a Go language binary that communicates with other bot nodes using a proprietary peer-to-peer protocol, researchers said.Craig Young, computer security researcher for Tripwire\u2019s vulnerability and exposure research team (VERT), noted that the use of Golang is an ongoing trend in malware development.\u201cGolang has been steadily rising in popularity including among IoT malware authors,\u201d he said via email. \u201cGo offers a strong feature set with the ability to easily produce self-contained executables across most popular architectures. This marks a shift from IoT malware like Mirai which uses C to produce very compact binaries compared to a Go executable.\u201dFrom a technical perspective, the botnet, which gets its name from phrasing inside the code samples, contains three functional modules, according to 360Netlab: A propagation module, a local HTTP service module and the P2P module.Infection RoutineOnce a device has been successfully brute-forced (its dictionary includes 171 usernames and 504 passwords), a malicious shell script named wpqnbw.txt is executed on the host, according to the analysis. This propagation module is an initial loader, which goes on to download and execute multiple versions of the second-stage binaries \u2013 one for each possible device type.The malicious scripts and binary programs are fetched from a legitimate pomf.cat site, which has been compromised, researchers explained.\u201c[There are downloads for] every single one of the malicious programs, for all different CPU architectures, there is no environment checking or things like that, [it] just run[s] all the programs in turn,\u201d explained 360Netlab researchers, in a posting this week.After the correct version of the code for the CPU architecture is determined, the sample is started. It first starts an HTTP server on the local port :80, researchers said \u2013 which is where the human-rights angle comes in.\u201cThe initial state of this HTTP server will be set :80/0 to :80/9 a total of 10 URIs,\u201d according to the post. \u201cCorrespondingly, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in eight languages \u2013 and two empty contents \u2013 are displayed. For example, the :80/0 returns the Chinese version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\u201dAfter this, the sample pulls data for the P2P module over the port, which overwrites the declaration. This is where the botnet gets down to business.P2P ModuleIn a P2P botnet, each node (a.k.a. \u201cpeer\u201d) has the capability to talk to other peers by what\u2019s known as a ping-pong mechanism. Through this, peers share the own command-and-control functions in a distributed way; maintain their own lists of other peers; and can spread other payloads or components to each other.In the case of HEH, the P2P module itself includes three components, starting with one that pings for all other nodes (peers) in the botnet at 0.1-second intervals (via a UDP service port) and waits for a pong back; and one that updates the node with the latest peer addresses.On the latter front, this peer update component receives commands every 10 seconds containing new peer addresses; the node will check whether its peer list already contains the peer address information, and if not, adds it to its peer list.The third component, a UDP service component, does most of the work, researchers explained: It monitors data or instructions sent by other peers, analyzes the instructions and performs corresponding operations.\u201cThis component has two key functions: UDP service port number generation and command parsing,\u201d according to 360Netlab.For the former, \u201cthe UDP service port of HEH botnet is not fixed, nor is it randomly generated, but is calculated based on [the] peer\u2019s own public network IP,\u201d explained the firm. \u201cEach time HEH bot receives a new peer\u2019s IP address, it will calculate the peer\u2019s UDP port according to the algorithm, and pack this information into its peer list.\u201dMeanwhile, the instructions that the HEH bot can parse come from a command-and-control server (C2), meaning that the botnet isn\u2019t a true P2P architecture \u2013 yet.\u201cThe P2P implementation still has flaws,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThe bot does maintain a peer list internally, and there is ongoing Ping<\u2013>Pong communication between peers, but the entire botnet still is considered centralized, as currently the bot node cannot send control commands.\u201dCommands and Self-DestructionThe commands that peers can parse are divided into two categories: P2P protocol-related functional instructions, which essentially keep the node updated and continuously connected to other peers; and a module responsible for control instructions (\u201cBot Cmd\u201d).The Bot Cmd list supported by HEH bot includes commands for restarting or exiting; executing shell commands; updating the peer list; updating the malware itself; and, crucially, something called \u201cSelfDestruct,\u201d which is the wiper function.SelfDestruct, which is command No. 8, will tell the bot to wipe out everything on all the disks on the host. Wipers like this are usually seen targeting critical infrastructure and nation-state types of targets, which makes this aspect of HEH stand out.Two other commands, \u201claunch attacks\u201d and \u201cMisc,\u201d are listed but not implemented in the samples analyzed by 360Netlab \u2013 potentially meaning that the botnet is still in the development stages. That\u2019s not to say it doesn\u2019t pose a threat.\u201cThe operating mechanism of this botnet is not yet mature,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cWith that being said, the new and developing P2P structure, the multiple CPU architecture support, the embedded self-destruction feature, all make this botnet potentially dangerous.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how many devices make up the botnet, or if the operators have hit the self-destruct button on any of them yet. Threatpost has reached out to 360Netlab for more information.Users can protect themselves by making sure Telnet ports 23/2323 aren\u2019t open to the public internet, and by ensuring strong passwords on devices.P2P Botnets on the RiseP2P architectures are attractive for botnets because they introduce redundancy and decentralization, making them difficult to dismantle. Also, a single communication to a single node is all it takes to propagate a new command or feature, allowing operators more opportunities for stealth when it comes to their control infrastructure.As such, P2P botnets have been on the rise. For instance, the coin-mining botnet known as DDG for instance adopted a proprietary peer-to-peer (P2P) mechanism in April that has turned the DDG into a highly sophisticated, \u201cseemingly unstoppable\u201d threat, according to researchers.Meanwhile, in September, news came that the Mozi botnet, a P2P malware known previously for taking over Netgear, D-Link and Huawei routers, has swollen in size to account for 90 percent of observed traffic flowing to and from all IoT devices, according to researchers.And in October, a new variant of the InterPlanetary Storm P2P botnet emerged, which comes with fresh detection-evasion tactics and now targets Mac and Android devices (in addition to Windows and Linux, which were targeted by previous variants of the malware).On October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "Two former Tenda router zero-days are anchoring the spread of a Mirai-based botnet called Ttint. In addition to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, this variant also has remote-access trojan (RAT) and spyware capabilities.According to 360Netlab, the botnet is unusual in a few ways. For one, on the RAT front, researchers said that it implements 12 remote access functions, that combine with custom command-and-control (C2) server commands to carry out tasks like setting up a Socket5 proxy for router devices, tampering with router DNS, setting iptables and executing custom system commands.In addition, Ttint also uses encrypted channels to communicate with the C2 \u2013 specifically, using the WebSocket over TLS (WSS) protocol. Researchers said that this allows the traffic to avoid detection while providing additional security.And finally, the infrastructure seems to migrate. 360Netlab first observed the attackers using a Google cloud service IP, before switching to a hosting provider in Hong Kong.Zero-DaysTenda routers are available at big-box stores and are used in homes and small offices. The first vulnerability used to spread Ttint samples (CVE-2018-14558) has been exploited since at least November of last year; but it wasn\u2019t disclosed until July. There\u2019s now a firmware update available to address it.The bug is a critical command-injection vulnerability, rated 9.8 out of 10 on the CvSS vulnerability-severity scale. It allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted goform/setUsbUnload request. It arises because the \u201cformsetUsbUnload\u201d function executes a dosystemCmd function with untrusted input.In late August, a second critical Tenda router vulnerability (CVE-2020-10987) emerged in the campaign. It\u2019s also rated 9.8 out of 10 and was initially disclosed in July by Independent Security Evaluators, after it had tried since January to get a patch from Tenda. It was able to exploit the bug in order to cause a DoS condition.The bug exists because the goform/setUsbUnload endpoint of Tenda AC15 AC1900 version 15.03.05.19 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary system commands via the deviceName POST parameter, according to the CVE description.360Netlab also tried to warn Tenda about issues with the bug, this time for use in botnet infections.\u201cOn August 28, 2020, we reported the details of the second 0-day vulnerability and the PoC [proof of concept] to the router manufacturer Tenda via email, but the manufacturer has not yet responded,\u201d researchers said.Threatpost has reached out to the manufacturer for more information.Ttint RATTtint as a malware can carry out 10 typical Mirai DDoS attack instructions (including multiple attack vectors), along with 12 RAT instructions and 22 custom C2 commands that work together.\u201cGenerally speaking, at the host level, Ttint\u2019s behavior is relatively simple,\u201d according to the researchers. \u201cWhen running, it deletes its own files, manipulates the watchdog and prevents the device from restarting, it runs as a single instance by binding the port; then modifies the process name to confuse the user\u2026it finally establishes a connection with the decrypted C2, reporting device information, waiting for C2 to issue instructions, and executing corresponding attacks or custom functions.\u201dResearchers said, among the most notable of the RAT functions is the command to bind a specific port issued by C2 to enable Socket5 proxy service. This allows attackers to remotely access the router\u2019s intranet, and roam across the network.\u201cGenerally speaking, Ttint will combine multiple custom functions to achieve specific attack goals,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cTake the two adjacent commands we captured, the first command is\u00a0iptables -I INPUT -p tcp \u2013dport 51599 -j ACCEPT, to allow access to port 51599 of the affected device. The next command is to enable the Socket5 proxy function on port 51599 of the affected device. The combination of the two commands enabled and allowed the attacker to use the Socket5 proxy.\u201dAnother command tells the malware to tamper with the router DNS by modifying the resolv.conf file, allowing it to hijack the network access of any of the router\u2019s users. This in turn allows attackers to monitor or steal sensitive information.Meanwhile, by setting iptables up, the operators can achieve traffic forwarding and target address conversion, which could expose internal network services and lead to information disclosure. And, by implementing a reverse shell through socket, the author of Ttint can operate the shell of the affected routing device as a local shell.And finally, the custom commands also allow the malware to self-update and self-destruct.The C2 information of the Ttint Bot sample is encrypted and stored in the configuration information table in the Mirai format, protected with a XOR key, researchers said.\u201cWhen the bot is running, it decrypts to obtain the C2 address,\u2026and then communicates with C2 securely through the WebSocket over TLS protocol,\u201d according to the researchers. \u201cWhen Ttint C2 replies to the bot with a response code of 101, it means that the protocol handshake is completed, and then the bot can communicate using the WebSocket protocol.\u201dThere has of late been a\u00a0resurgence of Mirai-based malware\u00a0capable of building large botnets through the exploitation of poorly secured IoT devices. This has contributed to a significant uptick in the number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in the first half of the year, compared to the same period last year. The addition of the RAT and concerning C2 commands marks a change for the Mirai world, however.\u201cTwo zero-days, 12 remote-access functions for the router, encrypted traffic protocol and infrastructure IP that that moves around,\u201d the firm wrote in a recent blog. \u201cThis botnet does not seem to be a very typical player.\u201dOn October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "A new variant of the InterPlanetary Storm malware has been discovered, which comes with fresh detection-evasion tactics and now targets Mac and Android devices (in addition to Windows and Linux, which were targeted by previous variants of the malware).Researchers say, the malware is building a botnet with a current estimated 13,500 infected machines across 84 countries worldwide \u2013 and that number continues to grow. Half of the infected machines are in Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan. Other infected systems are in Russia, Brazil, the U.S., Sweden and China.\u201cWhile the botnet that this malware is building does not have clear functionality yet, it gives the campaign operators a backdoor into the infected devices so they can later be used for cryptomining, DDoS, or other large-scale attacks,\u201d said researchers with Barracuda in a Thursday analysis.The first variant of InterPlanetary Storm was discovered in May 2019 and targeted Windows machines. In June, a variant targeting Linux machines was also reported targeting IoT devices, such as TVs that run on Android operating systems, and Linux-based machines, such as routers with ill-configured SSH service.The botnet, which is written in Go, uses the Go implementation of libp2p, which is a network framework that allows users to write decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) applications. This framework was originally the networking protocol of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), on which researchers based the malware\u2019s name.\u201cThe malware is called InterPlanetary Storm because it uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) p2p network and its underlying libp2p implementation,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThis allows infected nodes to communicate with each other directly or through other nodes (i.e. relays).\u201dThe malware spreads via brute force attacks on devices with Secure Shell (SSH), a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Researchers noted this is similar to FritzFrog, another P2P malware. Another method of infection is by accessing\u00a0open Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) ports, which connect low-speed devices to computers.\u201cThe malware detects the CPU architecture and running OS of its victims, and it can run on ARM-based machines, an architecture that is quite common with routers and other IoT devices,\u201d said researchers.Machines infected worldwide by Interplanetary botnet. Credit: BarracudaThe newest variant of the malware has various big changes, most notably extending its targeting to include Mac and Android devices.\u00a0However, the new variant can also auto-update to the latest available malware version and kill other processes on the machine that present a threat, like debuggers or competing malware (by looking at strings such as \u201crig,\u201d \u201cxig\u201d and \u201cdebug\u201d).And, it now can detect honeypots by looking for the string \u201csvr04\u201d in the default shell prompt, for instance.Once infected, devices communicate with the command-and-control (C2) server to inform that they are part of the botnet. Researchers said, the IDs of each infected machine are generated during initial infection and will be reused if the machine restarts or the malware updates. Once downloaded, it also serves malware files to other nodes in the network. The malware also enables reverse shell and can run bash shell, said researchers.\u201cLibp2p applications handle incoming connection (streams) based on a logical address (i.e. unknown to the transport layer) called protocol ID,\u201d said researchers. \u201cBy convention, protocol ids have a path-like structure, with a version number as the final component.\u201dBotnets \u2013 particularly P2P botnets like Mozi,\u00a0Roboto\u00a0and DDG\u00a0\u2013 continue to appear in the threat landscape. To avoid infection, researchers suggest end users properly configure SSH access on all devices and use a cloud security posture management tool to monitor SSH access control, eliminating any potential configuration mistakes.\u201cWhen password login is enabled and the service itself is accessible, the malware can exploit the ill-configured attack surface,\u201d they said. \u201cThis is an issue common with routers and IoT devices, so they make easy targets for this malware.\u201dOn October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "The Mozi botnet, a peer-2-peer (P2P) malware known previously for taking over Netgear, D-Link and Huawei routers, has swollen in size to account for 90 percent of observed traffic flowing to and from all internet of things (IoT) devices, according to researchers.IBM X-Force noticed Mozi\u2019s spike within it\u2019s telemetry, amid a huge increase in overall IoT botnet activity. Combined IoT attack instances from October through June is 400 percent higher than the combined IoT attack instances for the previous two years.\u201cAttackers have been leveraging these devices for some time now, most notably via the Mirai botnet,\u201d according to IBM. \u201cMozi continues to be successful largely through the use of command-injection (CMDi) attacks, which often result from the misconfiguration of IoT devices. The continued growth of IoT usage and poor configuration protocols are the likely culprits behind this jump. This increase may have been fueled further by corporate networks being accessed remotely more often due to COVID-19.\u201dMozi first sauntered onto the scene in late 2019 targeting routers and DVRs, and has been analyzed a couple of times by various research teams. It\u2019s essentially a Mirai variant, but also contains snippets from Gafgyt and IoT Reaper \u2013 it\u2019s used for DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, spam campaigns and command- or payload-execution.IBM observed Mozi using CMDi for initial access to a vulnerable device via a \u201cwget\u201d shell command, then altering permissions to allow the threat actor to interact with the affected system. Wget\u00a0is a\u00a0command-line utility for downloading files from the web.\u201cCMDi attacks are extremely popular against IoT devices for several reasons. First, IoT embedded systems commonly contain a web interface and a debugging interface left over from firmware development that can be exploited,\u201d according to the firm\u2019s analysis, published Wednesday. \u201cSecond, PHP modules built into IoT web interfaces can be exploited to give malicious actors remote-execution capability. And third, IoT interfaces often are left vulnerable when deployed because administrators fail to harden the interfaces by sanitizing expected remote input. This allows threat actors to input shell commands such as \u2018wget.'\u201dMozi\u2019s DHT Attack RoutineIn Mozi\u2019s case, the wget command downloads and executes a file called \u201cmozi.a\u201d on vulnerable systems, according to IBM. Researchers said that the file executes on a microprocessor. Once the attacker gains full access to the device through the botnet, the firmware level can be changed and additional malware can be downloaded, depending on the goal of any specific attack.Mozi constantly updates the vulnerabilities that it tries to exploit via CMDi, banking on slow patch implementation, IBM noted. This is an activity that can be easily automated, which accelerates Mozi\u2019s growth. In IBM\u2019s latest analysis, the sample was using exploits for Huawei, Eir, Netgear, GPON Rand D-Link routers; devices using the Realtek SDK; Sepal SPBOARDs; MVPower DVRs; and multiple CCTV vendors.In addition, it can also brute-force Telnet credentials using a hardcoded list.Once it cracks a device, the Mozi botnet attempts to bind local UDP port 14737, and it finds and kills processes that use ports 1536 and 5888. Its code contains hardcoded distributed hash table (DHT) public nodes, which are then used to join the botnet\u2019s P2P network. DHT is a distributed system that provides a lookup service allowing P2P nodes to find and communicate with each other.Click to enlarge. Source: IBM.\u201cThe Mozi botnet uses a customized DHT protocol to develop its P2P network,\u201d according to IBM.In order for a new Mozi node to join the DHT network, the malware generates an ID for the newly infected device. The \u201cID is 20 bytes and consists of the prefix 888888 embedded in the sample or the prefix specified by the config file [hp], plus a randomly generated string.\u201dThis node will then send an initial HTTP request to http[:]//ia[.]51[.]la to register itself, and it also sends a DHT \u201cfind_node\u201d query to eight hardcoded DHT public nodes, which is used to find the contact information for a known Mozi node, and then connected to it, thus joining the botnet.The Mozi botnet infrastructure appears primarily sourced in China, accounting for 84 percent of observed infrastructure, IBM said.Rise of the P2P MachinesP2P botnets are increasingly common. Just this year, the FritzFrog botnet hopped onto the scene, actively breaching SSH servers since January. FritzFrog propagates as a worm, brute-forcing credentials at entities like governmental offices, educational institutions, medical centers, banks and telecom companies.Since the beginning of the year, a P2P coin-mining botnet known as DDG has seen a flurry of activity, releasing 16 different updates by April. Most notably, its operators have adopted a proprietary P2P mechanism that has turned the DDG into a highly sophisticated, \u201cseemingly unstoppable\u201d threat, according to researchers.And late last year, a P2P botnet named Roboto was found targeting a remote code-execution vulnerability in Linux Webmin servers.The P2P architecture is popular with cybercriminals; it offers greater resiliency than other types of botnets because control is decentralized and spread among all nodes. As such, there\u2019s no single point-of-failure and no command-and-control server (C2).As for Mozi, IBM warned that the IoT landscape will continue to be a rich hunting ground for botherders.\u201cAs newer botnet groups, such as Mozi, ramp up operations and overall IoT activity surges, organizations using IoT devices need to be cognizant of the evolving threat,\u201d the firm concluded. \u201cIBM is increasingly seeing enterprise IoT devices under fire from attackers. Command injection remains the primary infection vector of choice for threat actors, reiterating how important it is to change default device settings and use effective penetration testing to find and fix gaps in the armor.\u201dThreatpost has reached out for more information on Mozi\u2019s share of IoT traffic.\u00a0IoTMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A peer-to-peer (P2) botnet called FritzFrog has hopped onto the scene, and researchers said it has been actively breaching SSH servers since January.SSH servers are pieces of software found in routers and IoT devices, among other machines, and they use the secure shell protocol to accept connections from remote computers. SSH servers are common in enterprise and consumer environments alike.According to an analysis from Guardicore Labs, FritzFrog propagates as a worm, brute-forcing credentials at entities like governmental offices, educational institutions, medical centers, banks and telecom companies. FritzFrog has attempted to compromise tens of millions of machines so far, and has successfully breached more than 500 servers in total, Guardicore researcher Ophir Harpaz said. Victims include well-known universities in the U.S. and Europe, and a railway company; and the most-infected countries are China, South Korea and the U.S.\n\u201cFritzFrog executes a worm malware which is written in Golang, and is modular, multi-threaded and fileless, leaving no trace on the infected machine\u2019s disk,\u201d Harpaz explained, in a posting on Wednesday. Once the server is compromised, \u201cthe malware creates a backdoor in the form of an SSH public key, enabling the attackers ongoing access to victim machines.\u201dIt also can drop additional payloads, such as cryptominers.Swimming in a Unique PondFritzFrog is a P2P botnet, meaning that it has greater resiliency than other types of botnets because control is decentralized and spread among all nodes; as such, there\u2019s no single point-of-failure and no command-and-control server (C2).\u201cFritzFrog is completely proprietary; its P2P implementation was written from scratch, teaching us that the attackers are highly professional software developers,\u201d Harpaz said. She added, \u201cThe P2P protocol is completely proprietary, relying on no known P2P protocols such as \u03bcTP.\u201dAs far as the other technical details go, Guardicore analyzed the botnet by injecting its own nodes into the mix, giving researchers the ability to participate in the ongoing P2P traffic and see how it was built.They discovered that almost everything about FritzFrog is unique when compared with past P2P botnets: Harpaz noted that it doesn\u2019t use IRC like IRCflu; it operates in-memory unlike another cryptomining botnet, DDG; and runs on Unix-based machines unlike others like the InterPlanetary Storm botnet.Additionally, its fileless payload is unusual. Harpaz wrote that files are shared over the network to both infect new machines and run new malicious payloads on compromised ones \u2013 and that this is accomplished completely in-memory using blobs.\u201cWhen a node A wishes to receive a file from its peer, node B, it can query node B which blobs it owns using the command getblobstats,\u201d according to the researcher. \u201cThen, node A can get a specific blob by its hash, either by the P2P command getbin or over HTTP, with the URL http://:1234/. When node A has all the needed blobs \u2013 it assembles the file using a special module named Assemble and runs it.\u201dOne the malware is installed on a target by this method, it begins listening on port 1234, waiting for initial commands that will sync the victim with a database of network peers and brute-force targets. Once this initial syncing is finished, FritzFrog gets creative on the evasion-detection front when it comes to further communication from outside the botnet: \u201cInstead of sending commands directly over port 1234, the attacker connects to the victim over SSH and runs a netcat client on the victim\u2019s machine,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cFrom this point on, any command sent over SSH will be used as netcat\u2019s input, thus transmitted to the malware.\u201dMeanwhile, the botnet constantly updates itself with databases of targets and breached machines as it worms through the internet.\u201cNodes in the FritzFrog network keep in close contact with each other,\u201d Harpaz noted. \u201cThey constantly ping each other to verify connectivity, exchange peers and targets and keep each other synced. The nodes participate in a clever vote-casting process, which appears to affect the distribution of brute-force targets across the network. Guardicore Labs observed that targets are evenly distributed, such that no two nodes in the network attempt to \u2018crack\u2019 the same target machine.\u201dFurther, it was built with an extensive dictionary of breached names and passwords for brute-forcing purposes, making it highly aggressive (\u201cBy comparison, DDG, a recently discovered P2P botnet, used only the username \u2018root,'\u201d said Harpaz).The malware also spawns multiple threads to perform various tasks simultaneously. For instance, an IP address in the target queue will be fed to a Cracker module, which in turn will scan the machine attached to the IP address and try to brute-force it; a machine which was successfully breached is queued for malware infection by the DeployMgmt module; and a machine which was successfully infected will be added to the P2P network by the Owned module.In the event of a reboot of the compromised system, the malware leaves a backdoor behind, whose login credentials are saved by the network peers.\u201cThe malware adds a public SSH-RSA key to the authorized_keys file,\u201d according to the research. \u201cThis simple backdoor allows the attackers \u2013 who own the secret private key \u2013 for passwordless authentication, in case the original password was modified.\u201dThe malware also monitors the file system state on infected machines, periodically checking for available RAM, uptime, SSH logins and CPU-usage statistics. Other nodes take this information and uses it to determine whether to run a cryptominer or not.If it decides to run a cryptominer, the malware runs a separate process called \u201clibexec\u201d to mine the Monero cryptocurrency with an XMRig spinoff. Though this secondary infection is what the botnet has so far been used for, its architecture means that it could also install any other type of malware on infected nodes, should its authors decide to do so.In all, FritzFrog is highly advanced, Harpaz said, but there\u2019s a simple way to ward off a compromise: \u201cWeak passwords are the immediate enabler of FritzFrog\u2019s attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recommend choosing strong passwords and using public key authentication, which is much safer.\u201dAdmins should also remove FritzFrog\u2019s public key from the authorized_keys file, preventing the attackers from accessing the machine, she said. And, \u201crouters and IoT devices often expose SSH and are thus vulnerable to FritzFrog; consider changing their SSH port or completely disabling SSH access to them if the service is not in use.\u201dIt\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

The botnet can be marshalled into service to carry out a variety of criminal activities, including distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, command execution, information exfiltration or sabotage of an infected system.Researchers said they observed DarkCrewFriends exploiting an unrestricted file upload vulnerability to compromise PHP servers that run websites. After compromise, a malicious PHP web shell is installed as a backdoor, which in turn sets up a connection to a command-and-control (C2) server using an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channel, according to Check Point researchers Liron Yosefian and Ori Hamama.\u201cMany applications allow users to upload certain files to their servers, such as images or documents,\u201d explained the researchers on Thursday in a blog post. \u201cThese files can put the system at risk if they are not properly handled. A remote attacker can send a specially crafted request to a vulnerable server and upload an unrestricted file while bypassing the server\u2019s file extension check. This can eventually result in arbitrary code execution on the affected system.\u201dThe exploit for the particular vulnerability being targeted is a zero-day that was created and published by DarkCrewFriends, according to Check Point. Threatpost has reached out for more information on the bug and other details of the campaign.The web shell on the victim\u2019s server defines either a GET parameter called osc or a GET parameter called anon, and executes a decompressed base64 string, according to the analysis.

        "raw text": "A 22-year-old man has been sentenced to more than a year in prison for developing Mirai botnet variants that compromised hundreds of thousands of devices worldwide.The man, Kenneth Currin Schuchman, of Vancouver, Wash., was sentenced to 13 months in prison after pleading guilty to creating and operating the Satori/Okiru, Masuta\u00a0and Tsunami/Fbot botnets. The botnets are considered \u201csuccessors\u201d to Mirai, as they use the same source code as the infamous botnet.Schuchman added additional features to the botnets over time, so that they grew more \u201ccomplex and effective,\u201d according to the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Thursday:\u00a0\u201cThe defendant used the botnets to facilitate DDoS attacks, which occur when multiple computers acting in unison flood targeted computers with information to prevent them from being able to access the internet,\u201d according to the DoJ\u2019s press release.Two of Schuchman\u2019s criminal associates have also been charged for their roles in developing and operating these botnets to conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, according to the DoJ. These associates are Aaron Sterritt, (also known by the alias \u201cVamp\u201d or \u201cViktor\u201d), who is a U.K. national, and Logan Shwydiuk, (known as \u201cDrake\u201d), a Canadian national.Schuchman engaged in criminal botnet activity since at least August 2017, during which he both rented out the internet-of-things (IoT) botnets and operated them himself. Following his arrest in August 2018, Schuchman continued to engage in criminal botnet activity, and violated several other conditions of his pretrial release, the DoJ said.Satori/Okiku was first identified by Check Point researchers in November 2017. In December 2017, researchers at Qihoo 360 Netlab said\u00a0Satori had infected more than 280,000 IP addresses in a 12-hour period and had gained control over 500,000 to 700,000 IoT devices. Then in December 2017, researchers identified a vulnerability in a Huawei home-router model that was being exploited to spread Satori/ Mirai Okiru. In 2018, researchers then linked the hacker behind Satori as the same one behind another botnet family, Masuta and PureMasuta.All these botnets are variants to Mirai, which was used in the 2016 DDoS attacks that targeted DNS provider Dyn and caused several well-known websites \u2013 including Twitter, Spotify and Netflix \u2013 to go dark for hours.

        "raw text": "The Hoaxcalls botnet, built to carry out large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, has been actively in development since the beginning of the year. One of its hallmarks is that it uses different vulnerability exploits for initial compromise.Researchers, however, have discovered that it\u2019s been a hit-or-miss journey for its operators when it comes to the bugs they choose \u2013 while at the same time, they\u2019ve had to reboot after takedowns.\u201cThe Hoaxcalls campaign has provided researchers with a number of opportunities over the last several months to explore the trials and errors in researching, developing and building a botnet campaign and the abandoned infrastructure that are left behind,\u201d explained Daniel Smith, researcher with Radware, in a Thursday posting. \u201cLike derelict satellites that orbit the earth, these bots skim and crawl vulnerable internet devices without a real objective.\u201dThe Hoaxcalls operators are among those botherders that differentiate themselves from amateur actors with the use of exploits \u2013 most of those with fewer technical skills tend to brute-force SSH and Telnet credentials in order to compromise devices and add them to their botnets.However, that strategy has its downsides, Smith noted.\u201cBotherders also have to compete with each other for their share of vulnerable resources,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf there are only 400 vulnerable devices for a given exploit, it\u2019s first-come, first-serve. Those that leverage recent or undisclosed exploits stand a better chance of infecting more devices than those that do not.\u201dA History of ExploitsHoaxcalls first emerged in late March, as a variant of the Gafgyt/Bashlite family; it\u2019s named after the domain used to host its malware, Hoaxcalls.pw. The original version was seen infecting devices through two vulnerabilities, according to Palo Alto Networks: A DrayTek Vigor2960 remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerability and a GrandStream Unified Communications remote SQL injection bug (CVE-2020-5722).Two new Hoaxcalls samples spotted by Radware showed up on the scene in April, incorporating new commands from its command-and-control (C2) server and a new exploit for an unpatched vulnerability impacting the ZyXEL Cloud CNM SecuManager that was disclosed in March.\u201cThe operators have also seemed to be favoring the Netlink GPON Router 1.0.11 RCE [in the last 90 days],\u201d Smith said.To date, the group has incorporated 12 different exploits since March, according to Smith.\u201cThis process is a bit like trial-and-error, and while the number seems impressive, not every attempt was a successful or fruitful one,\u201d he said. \u201cThe game of testing exploits for the purpose of propagating botnets is a fast pace, full contact sport. Those that cannot develop or discover their own exploits must rely on public disclosures. Once a proof-of-concept (PoC) is posted, the race is on to become the first to actively leverage the exploit.\u201dHoaxcalls FailuresSome of the exploits that the Hoaxcalls group tried but abandoned include the bugs tracked as CVE-2018-10562 and CVE-2018-10561, which are authentication-bypass and command-injection bugs for GPON home routers. Smith\u2019s analysis showed that the cyberattackers used it only a handful of times over the last 90 days.\u201cThe group likely abandoned this exploit for propagation because of its popularity with other, competing bot herders,\u201d explained Smith. \u201cThe CVEs for the GPON authentication bypass and command injection were posted back in May 2018. Because this exploit is widely known, it is over-saturated with botherders looking to capture or hijack what remains of devices are left on the internet.\u201dAnother example of a Hoaxcalls failed exploit is a post-authentication remote code-execution (RCE) bug in the Symantec Web Gateway version 5.0.2.8. In May, researchers at Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42 division observed the latest version of the botnet exploiting this unpatched bug, which exists in a product that became end-of-life (EOL) in 2015 and end-of-support-life (EOSL) in 2019.However, Smith speculated that the operators decided its use wasn\u2019t panning out \u2013 likely because of its exploitation difficulty level rather than over-saturation.\u201cFrom my perspective, Hoaxcalls is really the only campaign attempting to use this exploit,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cThis vulnerability likely saw limited success by the operators due to the post-authentication nature of the Symantec Secure Web Gateway RCE.\u201dIn general, exploits do not guarantee additional devices.\u201cThey can fail for one reason of another,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSome of these reasons include the threat actor\u2019s inability to properly leverage an exploit, a limited number of devices to target or oversaturation due to competition.\u201dAbandoned InfrastructureMeanwhile, the Hoaxcalls operators have lost several servers to take-down requests.\u201cTypically, when the malware host is taken down, the scanners have nothing left to load once they have discovered and compromised a vulnerable device,\u201d explained Smith. \u201cIn the event the C2 infrastructure is taken down, the bots will have nothing left to communicate with.\u201dThis typically leaves botherders in the position of having to build a new botnet from scratch.In April, a Hoaxcalls malware host (19ce033f.ngrok[dot]io was taken down, leaving infected devices to continue to scan the internet for more devices to compromise, while the threat actors simply resumed operations on another server with IP 178.32.148.5.This proliferated: On April 7, there were 183 IP addresses attempting to distribute Hoaxcalls payloads, compared to a total of 340 IPs at the end of May, according to Radware telemetry. The number of devices scanning has finally started to taper off, Smith said, probably because customers have rebooted the devices, crippling the malware, or the devices being re-infected and \u201cre-owned\u201d by a competing botherder.Overall, \u201cwhile the threat actors have had a good run so far, developing many variants and leveraging numerous exploits, they have experienced some degree of failure,\u201d Smith said. \u201cChalk it up to trial and error.\u201dConcerned about the IoT security challenges businesses face as more connected devices run our enterprises, drive our manufacturing lines, track and deliver healthcare to patients, and more?

        "raw text": "An operation from the China-based cybercrime gang known as DoubleGun Group has been disrupted, which had amassed hundreds of thousands of bots that were controlled via public cloud services, including Alibaba and Baidu Tieba.NetLab 360 researchers, in a recent posting, said that it noticed DNS activity in its telemetry that traced back to a suspicious domain (pro.csocools[dot]com) controlling mass amounts of infected Windows devices. Analysis of the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure of the operation and the malware used to build the botnet showed that the effort could be attributed to a known threat group \u2013 DoubleGun, a.k.a. ShuangQiang.\u201cIn the past, this [group] has been exposed by multiple security vendors, but it has revived and come back with new methods and great force,\u201d NetLab 360 researchers wrote.The latest campaign spread malware via pirate gaming portals, they added. Meanwhile, the gang used Alibaba Cloud storage and China\u2019s largest online community, Baidu Tieba, to host configuration files; and URL addresses hosted by Tencent Weiyun were used to manage the activity of the infected hosts, researchers said.\u201cThe campaign lures users who play underground games to install game-launching software that contains malicious code,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cClicking the download link will jump to a corresponding private server homepage where users are supposed to be able to download a game-launching patch. When user installs and launches the \u2018patch,\u2019 the malicious code accesses the configuration information server, and then downloads and dynamically loads the latest version of the malicious program named cs.dll from Baidu Tieba.\u201dUnder the HoodThe file cs.dll is hidden in image files hosted on Baidu Tieba. Each image contains separate image data and malicious code data. The key string in cs.dll also uses a deformed and customized DES encryption method, which is highly similar to DoubleGun samples that the researchers have captured before, they said.\u201ccs.dll will perform some simple virtual machine and anti-software countermeasures, and use the Baidu statistics service to report bot information [to the C2],\u201d according to the analysis. \u201c[It uses] the system API to create the bot ID of the host and write it to the registry \u2018SOFTWARE\\PCID.'\u201dAfter the Bot ID is established, the DoubleGang Group used standard fields within the Baidu statistics interface to report sensitive information about the host.\u201cBecause Baidu statistical service is used by a large number of websites, it is difficult to distinguish it, which makes it more difficult for security vendors to see and take action,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cThe interface gives the bot author the ability to upload statistics scripts this.b.v, user cookies, Bot ID and other statistical information so the author can easily manage and assess the infected users.\u201dA third-stage driver is then deployed, which fetches additional configuration information, also obfuscated with deformed DES encryption.\u201cAfter decryption, you can see that the configuration information uses a custom format,\u201d said the researchers. \u201cTwo Baidu pictures form a group, and the valid data is intercepted and stitched into a valid file. All configuration information returned by the driver samples contains a Tencent Weiyun address. This looks like a strategy for dynamically generating configuration file server addresses. We speculate that it may be a function in the development stage, so the sample code does not contain the corresponding code yet.\u201dOnce the malware is installed, the operators were then able to hijack system processes and download subsequent malicious programs.\u201cThe DLL obtains the configuration server related information by calling the driver,\u201d according to researchers. \u201cAccording to the downloaded configuration information, it goes to Baidu Tieba to download other malicious code to carry out the next stage of malicious activities.\u201dAll related services vendors took actions against the abuse according to NetLab 360, helping to shutter the campaign.\u201cBased on the massive threat intelligence, Baidu security anti-underground-economy platform had taken cooperate actions to calculate the botnet\u2019s infection, provide risk warnings to infected users and eventually blocked all the malware download,\u201d according to a media statement from Baidu. \u201cDuring this joint action, we had a better understanding of DoubleGun Gang\u2019s technical means, logic and rules, by sharing, analyzing, and response to the related threat intelligence.Concerned about the IoT security challenges businesses face as more connected devices run our enterprises, drive our manufacturing lines, track and deliver healthcare to patients, and more?

        "raw text": "While data breaches and ransomware are still considered among the more significant concern for businesses, the threats sometimes come from a direction we weren\u2019t expecting. Cybercriminals use botnets for various malicious purposes, most significantly for DDoS attacks against targets. The most important change is now the bot armies are increasingly made of IoT devices.As the total installed base of IoT devices worldwide is expected to reach 30.9 billion by 2025, the IoT botnet threat and its overall power continue to expand.Attackers seized the opportunity to create large botnets, to large complex DDoS attacks to disable or knock offline a target website. Although the IoT botnets can steal confidential data, as seen in the instance of the Torri botnet, most of the botnets have been used for DDoS attacks.This is a dangerous warning for an online business to ensure they have effective anti-DDoS protection and bot takeover prevention.High-Level Anatomy of IoT DDoS AttackSo, what is a botnet? \u2013 A botnet is a group of infected computers under the control of attackers used to perform various scams and cyber-attacks. Here, the attackers use malware to take control of vulnerable IoT devices to block legitimate users from accessing internet services by executing DDoS attacks.A simple principle governs a DDoS attack: it takes down websites offline by consuming more resources or occupying all available bandwidth. Attackers with more hijacked IoT devices can consume more resources and launch a more damaging attack. The three main goals of attackers include:\n\nTo cause consumption of limited resources\nTo cause destructive changes to network devices\nTo change or destroy configuration information\n\nTo cause consumption of limited resourcesTo cause destructive changes to network devicesTo change or destroy configuration informationWhy Are IoT Devices Easy Prey for Botnet Malware?The increased proliferation of IoT devices has become an attractive target for attackers. Further, most IoT devices include serious security issues like weak passwords, open access to management systems, default administrative credentials, or weak security configurations. As millions of IoT devices and their numbers continue to increase, they are not constantly updated to patch against security vulnerabilities.Botnet attacks seize the opportunity of IoT vulnerabilities to take control of the devices and lead to disruptions in online services. They\u2019re most placed on networks that are not monitored for the attack, making it easy for attackers to access them. Further, in most cases, the network where they reside offers a high-speed connection that enables a large amount of DDoS attack traffic.Major IoT Botnet DDoS Attack TrendsIoT botnet DDoS attacks are not new; Mirai was the most prevalent and has continued to target IoT devices since 2016. Mirai made its debut on September 20, 2016, with a DDoS attack against cybersecurity expert Krebs\u2019s blog. The next notable IoT botnet DDoS attack was in October 2016 against Dyn, a major DNS (Domain Name Service). The Mirai botnet assaulted the victim with one terabit traffic per second, which made a new record in a DDoS attack.According to the ENISA threat landscape report, in 2019, the Mirai variants increased by 57%. The Verizon data breach investigations report recorded 103 699 botnet incidents primarily targeting professional, financial, and information services industry verticals.A new variant of Mirai called Mozi accounted for the most observed flooded traffic in late 2019 through 2020. The Mirai and its variant continue to pose a threat in 2021; they broadened their attack with its significant new capabilities.Attackers use multiple botnets based on Mirai and Mozi botnets like Echobot, BotenaGo, Moonet, and Loli to target devices. According to Sam\u2019s report on the IoT security landscape, more than 1 billion IoT security attacks took place in 2021, nearly 62 million of which were IoT-related DDoS attacks.How Can You Protect Against IoT Botnet DDoS Attacks Today?As the botnet landscape expands and highly sophisticated threats become inevitable, enterprises must move beyond legacy security solutions.The first step to addressing these ongoing security challenges is moving to comprehensive risk-based security solutions. In addition, advanced, automated endpoint detection and protection solutions must offer complete visibility into IoT devices and their security state.As always, prevention steps should be implemented to stay protected from such attacks:Monitor incoming and outgoing traffic on your network for malicious activities with a web application firewall. Next-gen WAF like Indusface AppTrana can block bad bots from specific IPs while ensuring a smooth transfer of legitimate bot traffics.Monitor login attempts and create a lookout for spikesKeep IoT devices on protected networksPerform continuous security testing on IoT devicesThe ClosureDDoS attacks are the standard intent of an IoT botnet. DDoS may be an unavoidable part of the new reality, but you don\u2019t need to take it as the new norm. Architect robust security solutions to properly secure your businesses.SponsoredVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "An unpatched Domain Name System (DNS) bug in a popular standard C library can allow attackers to mount DNS poisoning attacks against millions of IoT devices and routers to potentially take control of them, researchers have found.Researchers at Nozomi Networks Labs discovered the flaw affecting the implementation of DNS in all versions of uClibc and uClibc-ng, popular C standard libraries found in numerous IoT products, they revealed in a blog post this week.\u201cThe flaw is caused by the predictability of transaction IDs included in the DNS requests generated by the library, which may allow attackers to perform DNS poisoning attacks against the target device,\u201d Nozomi\u2019s Giannis Tsaraias and Andrea Palanca wrote in the post.In a DNS poisoning attack\u2013 also known as DNS spoofing and DNS cache poisoning\u2013an attacker deceives a DNS client into accepting a forged response. This forces a program to perform network communications with an arbitrarily defined endpoint instead of the legitimate one.Numerous Affected DevicesThe scope of the flaw is vast, as major vendors such as Linksys, Netgear and Axis, as well as Linux distributions such as Embedded Gentoo, use uClibe in their devices. Meanwhile, uClibc-ng is a fork specifically designed for OpenWRT, a common OS for routers deployed throughout various critical infrastructure sectors, researchers said. Specific devices impacted by the bug were not disclosed as part of this research.Moreover, if an attacker mounts a successful DNS poisoning attack on an affected device, they also can perform a subsequent man-in-the-middle attack, researchers said. This is because by poisoning DNS records, they can re-route network communications to a server under their control, researchers said.\u201cThe attacker could then steal and/or manipulate information transmitted by users, and perform other attacks against those devices to completely compromise them,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThe main issue here is how DNS poisoning attacks can force an authenticated response.\u201dResearchers are currently working with the maintainer of the uClibe library to develop a fix for the vulnerability, which leaves devices vulnerable, they said. Because of this, Nozomi researchers have declined to disclose specific details of the device on which they were able to reproduce the flaw to keep attackers at bay, they said.DNS as a TargetNews of the DNS vulnerability brings reminders of last year\u2019s Log4Shell flaw, which sent ripples of concern within the cybersecurity community when it was discovered in December because of its scope. The flaw affects the ubiquitous open-source Apache Log4j framework\u2014found in countless Java apps used across the internet. In fact, a recent report found that the flaw continues to put millions of Java apps at risk, though a patch exists for the flaw.Though it affects a different set of targets, the DNS flaw also has a broad scope not only because of the devices it potentially affects, but also because of the inherent importance of DNS to any device connecting over IP, researchers said.DNS is a hierarchical database that serves the integral purpose of translating a domain name into its related IP address. To distinguish the responses of different DNS requests aside from the usual 5-tuple\u2013source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol\u2013and the query, each DNS request includes a parameter called \u201ctransaction ID.\u201dThe transaction ID is a unique number per request that is generated by the client and added in each request sent. It must be included in a DNS response to be accepted by the client as the valid one for request, researchers noted.\u201cBecause of its relevance, DNS can be a valuable target for attackers,\u201d they observed.The Vulnerability and ExploitationResearchers discovered the flaw while reviewing the trace of DNS requests performed by an IoT device, they said. They noticed something abnormal in the pattern of DNS requests from the output of Wireshark. The transaction ID of the request was at first incremental, then reset to the value 0x2, then was incremental again.\u201cWhile debugging the related executable, trying to understand the root cause, we eventually noticed that the code responsible for performing the DNS requests was not part of the instructions of the executable itself, but was part of the C standard library in use, namely uClibc 0.9.33.2,\u201d they explained.Researchers performed a source code review and found that the uClibc library implements DNS requests by calling the internal \u201c__dns_lookup\u201d function, which is located in the source file \u201c/libc/inet/resolv.c.\u201dEventually they found fault with some of the lines of code in the library\u2014specifically line #1240, #1260, #1309, #1321 and #1335, to which they could attribute the anomaly in the DNS request pattern, which makes the transaction ID predictable, researchers said.This predictability creates a scenario in which an an attacker would need to craft a DNS response that contains the correct source port, as well as win the race against the legitimate DNS response incoming from the DNS server to exploit the flaw, researchers said.\u201cIt is likely that the issue can easily be exploited in a reliable way if the operating system is configured to use a fixed or predictable source port,\u201d they explained.To exploit the flaw also depends on how an OS applies randomization of source port, which means an attacker would have to bruteforce the 16-bit source port value by sending multiple DNS responses, while simultaneously beating the legitimate DNS response, researchers added.MitigationResearchers explained, because the bug remains patched on millions of IoT devices, it is not disclosing the specific devices vulnerable to attack. In the interim, Nozomi Networks recommends that network administrators increase their network visibility and security in both IT and Operational Technology environments.\u201cThis vulnerability remains unpatched, however we are working with the maintainer of the library and the broader community in support of finding a solution,\u201d they wrote.IoTVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Newly surfaced malware that is difficult to detect and written in Google\u2019s open-source programming language has the potential to exploit millions of routers and IoT devices, researchers have found.Discovered by researchers at AT&T AlienLabs, BotenaGo can exploit more than 30 different vulnerabilities to attack a target, Ofer Caspi, a security researcher at Alien Labs, wrote in a blog post published Thursday.The malware, which is written in Golang\u2014a language Google first published in 2007\u2013works by creating a backdoor to the device. It then waits to either receive a target to attack from a remote operator through port 19412 or from another related module running on the same machine, he wrote.Register now for our LIVE event!Golang, also known as Go, is aimed at simplifying how software is built by making it easy for developers to compile the same code for different systems. This feature may be the reason why it\u2019s caught on with malware developers in the last few years, since it also makes it easier for attackers to spread malware on multiple operating systems, Caspi wrote.Indeed, research from Intezer, which offers a platform for analyzing malware, suggests that there has been a 2,000 percent increase in malware code written in Go being found in the wild, he wrote.Researchers said at this time they don\u2019t know which threat actor or actors developed BotenaGo, nor the full scale of devices that are vulnerable to the malware. So far, antivirus protections also don\u2019t seem to recognize the malware, sometimes misidentifying it as a variant of Mirai malware, Caspi wrote.Setting Up the AttackBotenaGo commences its work with some exploratory moves to see if a device is vulnerable to attack, Caspi wrote. It starts by initializing global infection counters that will be printed to the screen, informing the attacker about total successful infections. The malware then looks for the \u2018dlrs\u2019 folder in which to load shell scripts files. If this folder is missing, BotenaGo stops the infection process.In its last step before fully engaging, BotenaGo calls the function \u2018scannerInitExploits\u2019, \u201cwhich initiates the malware attack surface by mapping all offensive functions with its relevant string that represent the targeted system,\u201d Caspi wrote.Register now for our LIVE event!Once it establishes that a device is vulnerable to attack, BotenaGo proceeds with exploit delivery by first querying the target with a simple \u201cGET\u201d request. It then searches the returned data from the \u201cGET\u201d request with each system signature that was mapped to attack functions.Researchers detail several possible attacks that can be carried out using this query. In one,\u00a0 the malware maps the string \u201cServer: Boa/0.93.15\u201d to the function \u201cmain_infectFunctionGponFiber,\u201d which attempts to exploit a vulnerable target, Caspi wrote.This allows the attacker to execute an OS command via a specific web request using a vulnerability tracked as CVE-2020-8958. A SHODAN search turned up nearly 2 million devices that are vulnerable to this type of attack alone, he wrote.\u201cIn total, the malware initiates 33 exploit\u00a0functions that are ready to infect potential victims,\u201d Caspi wrote. A full list of the vulnerabilities that BotenaGo can exploit is included in the post.Backdooring Devices to Execute CommandsThere are two different ways that the malware can receive commands to target victims, researchers found. One is the create backdoor ports\u201331421 and 19412\u2014that are used in an attack scenario, Caspi wrote.\u201cOn port 19412 it will listen to receive the victim IP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce a connection with information to that port is received, it will loop through mapped exploit functions and execute them with the given IP.\u201dThe second way BotenaGo can receive a target command is by setting a listener to system IO (terminal) user input, getting the command to the device that way, Caspi explained.\u201cFor example, if the malware is running locally on a virtual machine, a command can be sent through telnet,\u201d he wrote.Dangers to Corporate NetworkGiven its ability to exploit devices connected over internet ports, BotenaGo can be potentially dangerous to corporate networks by gaining access through vulnerable devices, said one security professional.\u201cBad actors, such as those at work here, love to exploit these devices to gain access to the internal networks behind them, or just to use it as a platform from which to launch other attacks,\u201d observed Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at security firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.Attackers that can be launched once a hacker takes over a device and piggybacks on the network it\u2019s using include DDoS attacks, which that can lead to extortion of money from victims, he said. Attackers also can host and spread malware using a victim\u2019s internet connection, Kron observed.Given the number of vulnerabilities of which it can take advantage, BotenaGo also shows the importance of keeping IoT and routers updated with the latest firmware and patches to avoid leaving them available to exploit, he added.Want to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

        "raw text": "The first six months of 2021 have seen a more than 100-percent growth in cyberattacks against internet-of-things (IoT) devices, researchers have found.According to a Kaspersky analysis of its telemetry from honeypots shared with Threatpost, the firm detected more than 1.5 billion IoT attacks \u2013 up from 639 million during the previous half year, which is more than twice the volume.\u201cSince IoT devices, from smartwatches to smart home accessories, have become an essential part of our everyday lives, cybercriminals have skillfully switched their attention to this area,\u201d said Dan Demeter, security expert at Kaspersky. \u201cWe see that once users\u2019 interest in smart devices rose, attacks also intensified.\u201dIt should be noted that it\u2019s not just a concern on the personal front, either. With millions still working from home, cybercriminals are targeting corporate resources via home networks and in-home smart devices too, according to Red Canary\u2019s Grant Oviatt. They know organizations haven\u2019t quite gotten used to the new perimeter \u2014 or lack thereof.\u201cThroughout the past 12 months, the lack of [incident] preparedness has become increasingly evident, especially with the influx of personal devices logging onto corporate networks, the resulting reduced endpoint visibility, expanded attack surface and surge in attack vectors,\u201d he said in a recent Infosec Insider column for Threatpost.In real-world attacks, the end result of attacks on IoT gear is evolving, Kaspersky found: Infected devices being used to steal personal or corporate data as mentioned, and mine cryptocurrencies, on top of traditional DDoS attacks in which the devices are added to a botnet.For instance, the Lemon Duck botnet targets victims\u2019 computer resources to mine the Monero virtual currency, and it has self-propagating capabilities and a modular framework that allows it to infect additional systems to become part of the botnet too. It has at least 12 different initial-infection vectors \u2013 more than most malware, including targeting IoT devices with weak or default passwords. This includes brute-forcing attempts on enterprise telnet credentials (telnet being the protocol used to access and manage a device remotely).Source: Kaspersky.Indeed, in Kaspersky\u2019s telemetry, the attempted malicious connections used telnet most often; the rest used SSH and basic web connections.In addition to weak passwords offering a way to compromise IoT targets, more and more vulnerabilities are coming to light that make IoT gadgets more attractive to attackers, too. The firm noted that more and more exploits are being weaponized by cybercriminals than ever before.Just last week for instance, a collection of vulnerabilities dubbed BrakTooth was disclosed, affecting Bluetooth stacks implemented on system-on-a-chip (SoC) circuits from over a dozen vendors. One of the bugs allows code-execution on smart devices, researchers from the University of Singapore found \u2013 making them available to botnets and data thieves armed with spyware.\u201cThis has serious implications if such an attack is applied to Bluetooth-enabled smart home products,\u201d the researchers warned.Also last week, researchers from Claroty revealed a vulnerability in the Belledonne Communications\u2019 Linphone SIP Protocol Stack. Linphone is a 20-year-old open-source voice over IP (VoIP) project touting itself as the first open-source application to use SIP on Linux.\u201cEnterprise IoT devices today are commonly connected to both voice and video devices like phones, surveillance cameras, connected doorbells and other security systems,\u201d explained the researchers. \u201cWhen these SIP protocols become compromised, an attacker can gain a foothold into a corporate network, and possible the entire IoT/OT network. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, requiring no action from the victim.\u201dHow to Keep Smart Devices Safe from Cyberattacks\u201cSome people believe they aren\u2019t important enough to be hacked but we\u2019ve observed how attacks against smart devices intensified during the past year,\u201d Demeter said. \u201cMost of these attacks are preventable.\u201dTo keep your devices safe, Kaspersky recommended that users implement the following best practices:\n\nInstall updates for firmware as soon as possible. Once a vulnerability is found, it can be fixed through patches within updates.\nAlways change preinstalled passwords. Use complicated passwords that include both capital and lower-case letters, numbers and symbols, if possible.\nReboot a device as soon as it begins acting strangely. Note: This might help eliminate existing malware, but this doesn\u2019t reduce the risk of getting another infection.\nReview and choose security solutions that help to protect IoT ecosystems\n\nInstall updates for firmware as soon as possible.

        "raw text": "Security researchers have discovered a critical flaw that affects tens of millions of internet-of-things (IoT) devices \u2013 one that exposes live video and audio streams to eavesdropping threat actors and which could enable attackers to take over control of devices, including security webcams and connected baby monitors.The flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-28372 and FEYE-2021-0020 and assigned a critical CVSS3.1 base score of 9.6, was found in devices connected via ThroughTek\u2019s Kalay IoT cloud platform.The alarm was sounded on Tuesday by Mandiant, in coordination with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and ThroughTek. Mandiant\u2019s Red Team discovered the vulnerability in late 2020.\u201cCVE-2021-28372 poses a huge risk to an end user\u2019s security and privacy and should be mitigated appropriately,\u201d according to Mandiant\u2019s post. \u201cUnprotected devices, such as IoT cameras, can be compromised remotely with access to a UID and further attacks are possible depending on the functionality exposed by a device.\u201dThe world has already been inundated with tales of what can happen when these kind of devices are misconfigured or riddled with vulnerabilities, and this just adds to the growing pile of scary headlines. For example, in February, a vulnerability affecting multiple baby monitors was found to expose hundreds of thousands of live devices, potentially allowing someone to drop in and view a camera\u2019s video stream.As Mandiant explained, the flaw would enable adversaries \u201cto remotely compromise victim IoT devices, resulting in the ability to listen to live audio, watch real time video data, and compromise device credentials for further attacks based on exposed device functionality. These further attacks could include actions that would allow an adversary to remotely control affected devices.\u201dIn a Tuesday post, researchers Jake Valletta, Erik Barzdukas and Dillon Franke \u2013 who discovered the bug \u2013 explained that it\u2019s impossible to compile a comprehensive list of companies and products affected, given how the Kalay protocol is integrated by manufacturers and resellers before devices reach consumers. Though they couldn\u2019t come up with a definitive list of affected companies and products that implement the Kalay platform, they strongly advised users of IoT devices \u201cto keep device software and applications up to date and use complex, unique passwords for any accounts associated with these devices.\u201dMandiant also recommends that device owners avoid connecting to affected devices from untrusted networks, such as public Wi-Fi: a recommendation that\u2019s already part of wireless best practices, as the National Security Agency (NSA) recently advised in a public service announcement (PDF).Kalay: A Newly Unappealing HandshakeAccording to ThroughTek, \u201cKalay\u201d is an indigenous Dawu word that means \u201chandshake,\u201d \u201csymbolizing the universal link in an interconnected world.\u201dThroughTek implements that handshake \u2013 the Kalay protocol \u2013 as a software development kit (SDK). The Kalay SDK provides a plug-and-play network to easily connect smart devices with corresponding mobile apps.The researchers provided an illustration that gives an example of how it works: The figure below shows a typical device registration process and client connection on the Kalay network. In this example, a user remotely accesses their home network\u2019s Kalay-enabled camera on a mobile app from a remote network: for example, a user would view their home camera\u2019s feed while in a coffee shop or on a mobile phone networkKalay flow. Source: Mandiant.How Many Devices Are Affected? Impossible to SayTo get a high-level view of the scope of potentially affected products and companies, researchers pointed to ThroughTek\u2019s advertising, which boasts of supporting upwards of 83 million active devices and more than 1.1 billion monthly connections on the platform. ThroughTek also supports 250 systems-on-a-chip (SOCs): the microchips that contain all the necessary electronic circuits and parts for small consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones or wearable computers.Mandiant said that affected Kalay products include IoT camera manufacturers, smart baby monitors, and Digital Video Recorder (DVR) products.Researchers noted that this ThroughTek bug is worse than the critical Nozomi Networks vulnerability disclosed in May: a bug that was already quite severe in that it laid open millions of connected cameras, leaving them prey to having remote attackers get at camera feeds. But besides eavesdropping, this latest Kalay vulnerability means that devices could be remotely controlled by people who have no business tinkering with other people\u2019s baby monitors, webcams or other IoT gadgets, Mandiant said.\u201cThis latest vulnerability allows attackers to communicate with devices remotely,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cAs a result, further attacks could include actions that would allow an adversary to remotely control affected devices and could potentially lead to remote code execution.\u201dHow the Bug WorksMandiant determined that the problem lies in the device registration process, which requires only a device\u2019s 20-byte, uniquely assigned identifier \u2013 which they refer to as a UID \u2013 to access the network. Mandiant\u2019s testing showed that, typically, the UID is provided by a Kalay-enabled client, such as a mobile app, from a web API hosted by the company that markets and sells a given device.In order to exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need both deep knowledge of the Kalay protocol and the ability to generate and send messages. They\u2019d also have to get their hands on those Kalay UIDs, which they could wriggle away via \u201csocial engineering or other vulnerabilities in APIs or services that return Kalay UIDs,\u201d the researchers said. As an alternative, Mandiant also investigated brute forcing ThroughTek UIDs, but researchers said that it sucked up too much time and resources.After they get their hands on the UIDs, an attacker could take over the associated, affected devices. With some knowledge of the Kalay protocol, they\u2019d be able to re-register the UID, overwriting the existing Kalay device on the Kalay servers. Then, whenever the legitimate owner tries to access the device, the UID will be directed to the attacker, in effect leading to hijacking of the connection.As Mandiant director Jake Valletta told Wired, the legitimate device owner would experience a few seconds of lag, but that\u2019s the only difference that would be apparent from their perspective.After that, the attacker can continue with the connection process in order to steal the device owner\u2019s username and password. The figure below shows what happens when both a victimized device and a malicious device with the same UID exist on the network: Namely, the malicious registration overwrites the existing registration and force the legitimate device\u2019s connections to be re-routed to the attacker\u2019s device.Attacker exploiting device personation vulnerability to capture credentials. Source: Mandiant.After that, a threat actor can remotely connect to the victimized device, access audio/visual data and execute remote procedure calls (RPC), Mandiant said. Due to vulnerabilities in the device-implemented RPC interface, this can then lead to \u201cfully remote and complete device compromise,\u201d researchers described. Their enumeration of what makes this possible: \u201cMandiant observed that the binaries on IoT devices processing Kalay data typically ran as the privileged user root and lacked common binary protections such as Address Space Layout Randomization (\u201cASLR\u201d), Platform Independent Execution (\u201cPIE\u201d), stack canaries, and NX bits.\u201dThe figure below shows a hypothetical attack using the captured Kalay credentials to stage yet another attack by abusing the vulnerabilities in the Kalay RPC interface:Mandiant isn\u2019t releasing public exploit code, but it did provide the video below, which demonstrates a proof of concept for CVE-2021-28372.How to Address the BugMandiant \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d that companies using the Kalay platform follow the following guidance from ThroughTek and Mandiant:If the implemented SDK is below version 3.1.10, upgrade the library to version 3.3.1.0 or version 3.4.2.0 and enable the Authkey and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) features provided by the Kalay platform.If the implemented SDK is version 3.1.10 and above, enable Authkey and DTLS.Review security controls in place on APIs or other services that return Kalay unique identifiers (UIDs).Hardening features such as ASLR, PIE, NX, and stack canaries should be enabled on all binaries processing Kalay data and RPC functions should be treated as untrusted and sanitized appropriately.IoT device manufactures should apply stringent controls around web APIs used to obtain Kalay UIDs, usernames, and passwords to minimize an attacker\u2019s ability to harvest sensitive materials needed to access devices remotely. Failure to protect web APIs which return valid Kalay UIDs could allow an attacker to compromise a large number of devices.Mandiant thanked ThroughTek and CISA for their cooperation and support with releasing the advisory and for their \u201ccommitment to securing IoT devices globally.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Cloud SecurityIoTVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Full transparency: Curtis Simpson, CISO at Armis, the enterprise IoT security company, was fundamentally a black hat at the age of 12, before he even knew what a black hat was. One day he got flooded over IRC and was fascinated: What just happened? And how did it happen?He\u2019s since spent the vast majority of his career as a white hat. It was an easy transition, he told us in a recent Threatpost podcast: You take the attacker mindset, where \u201cyou think about the tactics and techniques that you would typically apply, and then reverse-engineer those when you think about a program.\u201dThat mindset comes in handy in the space of OT and ICS: in other words, the world of operational technology (OT), \u2013 the computing systems used to manage industrial operations \u2013 and industrial control systems (ICS). In this space, where \u200b\u200bOT and ICS are powering some of the most critical infrastructure in the world \u2013 be it supply chain facilities or warehouse operations \u2013 a proliferation of legacy systems mean that outdated infrastructure is rife.\u201cMost of the tech, the OT and ICS tech that exists in an enterprise or in critical industry, is decades old,\u201d Simpson explains, \u201cThe interesting thing we\u2019re seeing now, and why we\u2019re seeing so many vulnerabilities being disclosed, is because those vulnerabilities have always been there.\u201dThe reality is that researchers and attackers weren\u2019t really looking for those vulnerabilities at the level they are today, Simpson explains. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is an interesting domino effect where record-setting ransomware payouts are happening with an OT and ICS organization. That\u2019s not by chance. \u2026 The conversation I used to have with the execs and the board was that if this type of type of attack plays out in that environment and the computers that are the operational technology in this landscape, the IoT devices in this landscape, the integrated IT devices in this landscape, once they\u2019re impacted, and that impact starts to actually get into the operational technology itself? We\u2019re going to be in a rip and replace scenario. That\u2019s going to take us days to weeks to fully recover from.\u201dAnd it\u2019s going to cost victims a lot to try to recover. Case in point: Colonial Pipeline, forced to close down its pipeline by a DarkSide ransomware attack. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is an exponential level of effort being put towards understanding exposures in these environments, streaming together, exploitations around [internet of things, or IoT] devices to be able to get to those environments,\u201d Simpson observes.In this podcast, Simpson details how threat actors are trying to get into those environments, be it APT28 \u2013 the threat actor that built one of the largest botnets ever seen, entirely from IoT devices \u2013 or the light shed subsequently shed on other bad actors that create weaponized abilities against ubiquitous IoT devices we all have.Download the podcast here or listen to the episode below.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Critical InfrastructureIoTMalwarePodcastsVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Another day, another incident of internet-of-things (IoT) gadgets falling flat on their faces and  spilling users\u2019 privacy, if not getting  hooked into a botnet,  used for cryptomining\u00a0or opening a network backdoor that allows intruders to move laterally through a network.It\u2019s only Wednesday, but already reports this week detail IoT devices pressed into service to spread misery. Thanks to an internal server bug, users of Anker\u2019s  Eufy home-security cameras found they could  view, pan and zoom in on each other\u2019s home-video feeds for about a day, turning them into both unwitting spies and targets to be ogled.Then too, we saw the debut of  a new botnet, Simp, that infects IoT devices in tandem with the prolific  Gafgyt botnet. Simp, like its IoT-abusing brethren, uses known security vulnerabilities \u2013 only one of the weak spots typical in IoT nodes. Given the frequency of IoT device takeovers, how easy must it be to pwn these things? And how can organizations fight back?Pwning IoT Gadgets Is Super-Duper EasyIt\u2019s as easy as hacking an ultrasound machine that\u2019s running on the  legacy Windows 2000 operating system, with its known, unpatched vulnerabilities\u2026a device that won\u2019t be patched by the vendor because it\u2019s end-of-life, though it\u2019s still operational and still in use in hospitals.Check Point\u2019s Itzik Feiglevitch and Justin Sowder said at an RSA Conference 2021 session on Tuesday \u2013 entitled  Into the Mind of an IoT Hacker \u2013 that pwning these things is as simple as pie. After all, there are tens of thousands of vulnerable IoT devices to be found with a Shodan search: The researchers pointed to a search that turned up 25,959 printers connected to the internet and 284,092 webcams.Those devices typically have no, or feeble, built-in security. They often run on legacy, weak OS passwords. They\u2019re also a bear to patch, for multiple reasons, such as the case of life-saving IoT medical devices can\u2019t be taken offline. That\u2019s just one reason why hospitals have been hit by a  growing wave of ransomware attacks, for example: According to a  report from Forescout, hospitals are struggling to manage a sprawling number of endpoints, ranging from computer systems, surgical equipment, telemedicine platforms, medical sensors and infusion pumps. All told, the report estimated that healthcare-delivery organizations contain an average of 20,000 devices.Back when these devices were developed, \u201cno one thought of that,\u201d Feiglevitch said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen Windows 95 running on some devices, or Windows 2000 with no security patches. Many use simple passwords, like \u20181234.\u2019 If you connect them, now you have hundreds of devices connected to your network.\u201dHow Do You Even Find Them, Internally?According to Feiglevitch, when Check Point asks new customers if they know how many IoT devices are connected to their network, the answer is always \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Organizations can have diverse types of devices, of course \u2013 industrial control systems alongside healthcare IT, for example. Besides this diversity, the devices often use proprietary IoT protocols. This all makes the nodes \u201cunmanaged and invisible,\u201d Feiglevitch noted. \u201cIf you look for them internally, you will not find those devices.\u201dBut attackers know how to find devices that are connected to businesses\u2019 networks on one side and to the internet on the other: Shodan is just one tool to do that. Check Point has found that, on average, enterprises with 5,000 employees have about 20,000 IoT devices on their networks; hospitals with 500 beds have about 10,000 healthcare IoT devices; and a factory with 2,000 workers has about 5,000 industrial IoT devices.The first thing an organization has to do to defend IoT devices and networks is to inventory them all, Feiglevitch instructed: every smartphone, every tablet, every hematology analyzer, every immunoassay analyzer, every router, every security camera, and on and on, in every smart office, every smart building, every industrial setting, and every medical facility.That includes granular details about every device: Is it an IP camera? What\u2019s the risk score, based on firmware version and known vulnerabilities? What are the device ID details \u2013 MAC address, firmware version, connection type, protocols? Who manufactures it, and what\u2019s its IP address?Vendors these days are able to generate a context-aware network security policy out of that intelligence map that gets enforced at the perimeter and inside the network, identifying and blocking malicious traffic with integrated threat prevention engines such as IPS, APPI and Anti-Bot, Sowder said.Small Compute Power Requires Small AgentsSowder said that many times, \u201cthe challenge with these IoT devices is the limited compute capability that they have on them. An IP camera can\u2019t run a full IPS protection suite against traffic to it. It has a job to record video and send it upstream.\u201dHe pointed to the potential solution of  nanotechnology: Specifically, the concept of a nanoagent on each IoT node that inspects firmware code to determine if it\u2019s engaged in malicious behavior, such as memory corruption. If so, the nanoagent can block it in real-time.The challenge is how to do it with a small footprint, Sowder said: \u201cA lot of devices don\u2019t have a lot of compute. Sticking a firewall in front of every IP camera simply isn\u2019t feasible. The solution is a very, very slight agent. It phones home to get a device signature, including what kind of device it is and what can run on it.\u201dNanoagents don\u2019t put a lot of overhead on these devices, so the devices\u2019 performance isn\u2019t slowed down, Sowder noted: \u201cThere\u2019s no overhead to prevent them from performing their functions.\u201dCheck Point has been working on a lightweight agent that relies on a cloud instance to pull down specific protection details related to that device. \u201cAs you can imagine, this is a large task and the ever-changing amount of IoT devices out there complicates that further, and I believe a standard should be in place,\u201d Sowder commented.Having said that, Sowder has seen signs that the manufacturers themselves are making progress: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see non-default passwords, encryption on device communication, hardening of web interfaces, etc. The challenge here absolutely has to have device manufacturers as part of the solution.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c 2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "Security researchers at Microsoft are warning the industry about 25 as-yet undocumented critical memory-allocation vulnerabilities across a number of vendors\u2019 IoT and industrial devices that threat actors could exploit to execute malicious code across a network or cause an entire system to crash.Dubbing the newly discovered family of vulnerabilities \u201cBadAlloc,\u201d Microsoft\u2019s Section 52\u2014which is the Azure Defender for IoT security research group\u2013said the flaws have the potential to affect a wide range of domains, from consumer and medical IoT devices to industry IoT, operational technology, and industrial control systems, according to a report published online Thursday by the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.\u201cOur research shows that memory allocation implementations written throughout the years as part of IoT devices and embedded software have not incorporated proper input validations,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWithout these input validations, an attacker could exploit the memory allocation function to perform a heap overflow, resulting in execution of malicious code on a target device.\u201dMemory allocation is exactly what it sounds like\u2013the basic set of instructions device makers give a device for how to allocate memory. The vulnerabilities stem from the usage of vulnerable memory functions across all the devices, such as malloc, calloc, realloc, memalign, valloc, pvalloc, and more, according to the report.From what researchers have found, the problem is systemic, so it can exist in various aspects of devices, including real-time operating systems (RTOS), embedded software development kits (SDKs), and C standard library (libc) implementations, they said. And as IoT and OT devices are highly pervasive, \u201cthese vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited, represent a significant potential risk for organizations of all kinds,\u201d researchers observed.On a positive note, Microsoft Section 52 said it has not seen any of the vulnerabilities as yet exploited in the wild. Researchers have disclosed their findings with the vendors whose devices are affected through responsible disclosure led by the MSRC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), leaving vendors now to investigate and patch the vulnerabilities, if appropriate.A separate advisory by the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency includes a full list of affected devices, which comprise a number of products from Texas Instruments as well as others from ARM, Samsung and Amazon, among other vendors.Of that list of 25 devices, 15 already have updates. Meanwhile, some vendors do not expect to have updates to fix the problem for various reasons, and others will release fixes at a later date, according to the advisory.If administrators running networks on which affected devices are present can\u2019t apply patches to fix the problem, the CISA and Microsoft have recommended other mitigations.The CISA recommends minimizing network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems to ensure that they are not accessible by the internet, which makes them low-hanging fruit for threat actors.The agency also advised that system administrators practice network segmentation, isolating system networks and remote devices from the business network as well as putting them behind firewalls. If remote access to these devices is required, secure methods should be used, such as VPNs that are updated with the latest security protocols, the CISA said.Microsoft recommends similar mitigations but also suggested that administrators implement more careful and continuous monitoring of devices on networks \u201cfor anomalous or unauthorized behaviors, such as communication with unfamiliar local or remote hosts.\u201dJoin Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d \u2013 a LIVE roundtable event on\u00a0Wed, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "As the pandemic continues to fuel the shift to remote work, numerous manufacturers have capitalized on this movement to create a multitude of handy internet of things (IoT) devices. While these devices may make our home and work lives more convenient, they greatly expand the attack surface for cybercriminals. Here, we\u2019ll take a look at the best cybersecurity practices that can thwart attacks.IoT devices introduce a host of vulnerabilities into organizations\u2019 networks and are often difficult to patch. With more than 30 billion active IoT device connections estimated by 2025, it is imperative information-security professionals find an efficient framework to better monitor and protect IoT devices from being leveraged for distributed denial or service (DDoS), ransomware or even data exfiltration.When the convenience of a doorbell camera, robot vacuum cleaner or cellphone-activated thermostat could potentially wreak financial havoc or threaten physical harm, the security of these devices cannot be taken lightly. We must refocus our cyber-hygiene mindset to view these devices as potential threats to our sensitive data. There are too many examples of threat actors gaining access to a supposedly insignificant IoT device, like the HVAC control system for a global retail chain, only to pivot to other unsecured devices on the same network before reaching valuable sensitive information.While phishing remains the most popular attack vector, reinforcing the need for humans to be an integral part of strong security program, IoT devices now offer another avenue for cybercriminals to access accounts and networks to steal data, conduct reconnaissance and further deploy malware.\u00a0 Recent cases have shown examples of this:In 2019, cybercriminals were able to gain access to a casino\u2019s database of \u201chigh roller\u201d clients when they compromised a smart thermometer in a fish tank in the casino\u2019s lobby and then pivoted into the casino\u2019s network;Vulnerabilities in a home alarm system led to cybercriminals conducting a DDoS attack by using these devices in a botnet as a mechanism to spread malware;And, a corporate executive\u2019s external Bluetooth-connected speaker allowed hackers to listen in on his sensitive conversations while he worked from home.When we think about the uses of IoT devices today, the repercussions from their compromise could present significant damage. For instance, a successful compromise of an internet-connected thermostat could compromise the integrity of sensitive, climate-controlled facilities housing pharmaceuticals (including vaccines), food and other perishable items.\u00a0Key Security Controls for IoT DevicesThe manufacturing cycle for the design of IoT devices rarely incorporates the implementation of security during the development process. This oversight has resulted in an increase of successful compromises, and not necessarily from sophisticated attacks. Some of the primary methods of IoT compromise and security measures to remediate these vulnerabilities include:As with most new devices that connect to a network, many IoT machines provide default passwords. Unfortunately, with the volume of stolen IP addresses available on dark web markets, if a user is still using the default password (also available on the dark web) or a simple password, which is susceptible to brute force attack, this may be an easy way for threat actors to gain further access to a network and, potentially, the sensitive data maintained on that network.Unpatched hardware and software has been a prime target of cyber-threat actors for years. Recently, we\u2019ve seen how unpatched operating systems led to the global WannaCry ransomware attack on Windows machines; unpatched software platform vulnerabilities being exploited, such as those experienced by users of Citrix; and, even in 2020, unpatched Eternal Blue exploits were used by threat actors to deploy large-scale ransomware attacks on compromised networks.Similar attacks on unpatched vulnerabilities have allowed cybercriminals to conduct lateral movement once a foothold is gained in a network. These have proven extremely disastrous for the volumes of victims of banking trojan and ransomware attacks. A patch-management policy must be created to automate patching when made available by hardware and software manufacturers, as well as provide guidance for immediate patching necessary on critical systems.The success of IoT attacks is usually achieved when a compromised IoT device is connected to a network that contains sensitive or critical data. IoT devices should be segmented from other systems on the network to limit a threat actor\u2019s ability to move laterally to where they can cause the most damage, both financially and to infrastructure.IT teams should conduct periodic inventories of their networks to identify which devices are connected and verify if they have been approved. This will also allow teams the ability to patch those devices now that they know they\u2019re active on the network. We have seen too many situations of threat actors having access to a network for months (and longer) when there has been uncertainty regarding unauthorized devices or accounts accessing a network. This unaddressed situation allows threat actors unfettered access to quietly conduct reconnaissance and identify not only critical data which has monetary value, but also to learn configurations and security features, and to deploy additional malware.Many IoT devices use Bluetooth as the method to connect to a network. However, Bluetooth has security vulnerabilities which could leave these devices open to attack. This is especially concerning when thinking about the potential impact on Bluetooth-enabled medical devices and implants, where a compromise could lead to the theft of PII/PHI or threaten the health of the patient if the device was disabled. It is highly suggested that users set up the non-discoverable mode when using Bluetooth-paired IoT devices. As hackers continue to identify vulnerabilities to Bluetooth, it is important to patch the firmware for Bluetooth-enabled devices as those security measures are issued by manufacturers.As we move into the middle of 2021, there is a general understanding (and consumer demand) that more IoT devices will be available to carry out a plethora of services. These devices stretch across many industries and range from home and consumer use to commercial applications. While they offer many valued features and conveniences, they also pose a potential risk of the compromise of sensitive data or unauthorized access to personal, corporate and government networks. Identifying and protecting your IoT device network today can save your time, data and capital in the future. But beware \u2013 doing so is not a one-time event and as technologies change, and so should your controls.Matt Dunn is associate managing director for cyber-risk at Kroll.\u00a0Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.Cloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderIoTMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A ransomware attack on leading internet-of-things (IoT) manufacturer Sierra Wireless this week ground its production activity to a halt and froze various other internal operations.The Canadian multinational manufacturer creates a broad array of communications equipment \u2013 from gateways to routers, cellular modems to modules, and smart connectivity solutions for IoT devices.The ransomware attack first hit on March 20, pushing the company\u2019s IT systems offline and halting production across its manufacturing sites. Sierra Wireless\u2019 website and other internal operations have also been disrupted by the attack, it said on Tuesday. The company\u2019s website (sierrawireless.com) is currently down, saying \u201cSite is under maintenance.\u201dThe company said that it\u2019s currently working to bring its internal IT systems back online, and hopes to restart production at its facilities \u201csoon.\u201d\u201cOnce the company learned of the attack, its IT and operations teams immediately implemented measures to counter the attack in accordance with established cybersecurity procedures and policies that were developed in collaboration with third-party advisors,\u201d according to Sierra Wireless.Due to the disruptions caused by the cyberattack, the company is also withdrawing its first-quarter 2021 guidance, which had been provided on Feb. 23 \u2014 highlighting the potential financial damages that the attack may have on the company.However, the company said, at this time it does not believe its customer-facing products and services have been impacted by the attack. It\u2019s not clear whether customer data has been affected.At this time, Sierra Wireless did not specify how the cyberattack initially occurred, what type of ransom was demanded and whether it was considering paying. It\u2019s also not clear how many production centers have been impacted by the cyberattack. Sierra Wireless operates a global network operation center (NOC), and research-and-development centers in Asia, Europe and North America.Sierra Wireless declined to comment further: \u201cBeyond notifying the third-party advisors, our customers and others impacted by the attack, we do not share our protocols for dealing with any ransomware attacks as this is considered highly sensitive and confidential,\u201d a spokesperson told Threatpost.Matt Sanders, director of security at LogRhythm, said that the incident is an example of the impact that a ransomware can have on an organization.\u201cUnfortunately, Sierra Wireless\u2019 entire production has halted thanks to an attack that has completely debilitated them,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cWhen an organization falls victim to ransomware, the pressure to get back to normal business operations is huge, and the ability to do so in a timely manner may be pivotal to the company\u2019s ability to continue operating at all.\u201dRansomware attacks have continued to plague companies across multiple industries this year \u2014 from a February attack on a\u00a0major Finnish IT provider that forced it to turn off some services and infrastructure in a disruption to customers, to PYSA ransomware attacks in early March\u00a0disrupting the education sector.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)HacksIoTMalware",

        "raw text": "A new variant of the Mirai botnet has been discovered targeting a slew of vulnerabilities in unpatched D-Link, Netgear and SonicWall devices \u2014 as well as never-before-seen flaws in unknown internet-of-things (IoT) gadgets.Since Feb. 16, the new variant has been targeting six known vulnerabilities \u2013 and three previously unknown ones \u2013 in order to infect systems and add them to a botnet. It\u2019s only the latest variant of Mirai to come to light, years after source code for the malware\u00a0was released\u00a0in October 2016.\u201cThe attacks are still ongoing at the time of this writing,\u201d said researchers with Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42 team on Monday. \u201cUpon successful exploitation, the attackers try to download a malicious shell script, which contains further infection behaviors such as downloading and executing Mirai variants and brute-forcers.\u201dInitial Exploit: New and Old FlawsThe attacks leverage a number of vulnerabilities. The known vulnerabilities exploited include: A SonicWall SSL-VPN exploit; a D-Link DNS-320 firewall exploit (CVE-2020-25506); Yealink Device Management remote code-execution (RCE) flaws (CVE-2021-27561 and CVE-2021-27562); a Netgear ProSAFE Plus RCE flaw (CVE-2020-26919); an RCE flaw in Micro Focus Operation Bridge Reporter (CVE-2021-22502); and a Netis WF2419 wireless router exploit (CVE-2019-19356\u00a0).Patches are available for all of these flaws; the botnet is targeting devices that have not yet applied the available updates.For instance, \u201cthe VisualDoor exploit in question targets an old SSL-VPN firmware vulnerability that was patched on legacy products in 2015 with 7.5.1.4-43sv and 8.0.0.4-25sv releases,\u201d a SonicWall spokesperson told Threatpost. \u201cIt is not viable against any properly patched SonicWall appliances.\u201dThe botnet also exploited vulnerabilities that were not previously identified. Researchers believe that these flaws exist in IoT devices.\u201cWe cannot say with certainty what the targeted devices are for the unidentified exploits,\u201d Zhibin Zhang, principal researcher for Unit 42, told Threatpost. \u201cHowever, based off of the other known exploits in the samples, as well as the nature of exploits historically selected to be incorporated with Mirai, it is highly probable they target IoT devices.\u201dThe exploits themselves include two RCE attacks \u2014 including an exploit targeting a command-injection vulnerability in certain components; and an exploit targeting the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) login script (stemming from a key parameter not being properly sanitized). The third exploit targets the op_type parameter, which is not properly sanitized leading to a command injection, said researchers.The latter has \u201cbeen observed in the past being used by [the] Moobot [botnet], however the exact target is unknown,\u201d researchers noted. Threatpost has reached out to researchers for further information on these unknown targets.Mirai Botnet: A Set of BinariesAfter initial exploitation, the malware invokes the wget utility (a legitimate program that retrieves content from web servers) in order to download a shell script from the malware\u2019s infrastructure. The shell script then downloads several Mirai binaries and executes them, one-by-one.One such binary includes lolol.sh, which has multiple functions. Lolol.sh deletes key folders from the target machine (including ones with existing scheduled jobs and startup scripts); creates packet filter rules to bar incoming traffic directed at the commonly-used SSH, HTTP and telnet ports (to make remote access to the affected system more challenging for admins); and schedules a job that aims to rerun the lolol.sh script every hour (for persistence). Of note, this latter process is flawed, said researchers, as the cron configuration is incorrect.Another binary (install.sh) downloads various files and packages \u2013 including GoLang v1.9.4, the \u201cnbrute\u201d binaries (that brute-force various credentials) and the combo.txt file (which contains numerous credential combinations, to be used for brute-forcing by \u201cnbrute\u201d).The final binary is called dark.[arch], and is based on the Mirai codebase. This binary mainly functions for propagation, either via the various initial Mirai exploits described above, or via brute-forcing SSH connections using hardcoded credentials in the binary.Mirai Variants Continue to Pop UpThe variant is only the latest to rely on Mirai\u2019s source code, which has proliferated into more than 60 variants since bursting on the scene with a\u00a0massive\u00a0distributed denial of service (DDoS) takedown of DNS provider Dyn in 2016.Last year, a Mirai variant was found targeting Zyxel network-attached storage (NAS) devices using a critical vulnerability that was only recently discovered, according to security researchers. In 2019, a variant of the botnet was found sniffing out and targeting vulnerabilities in enterprise wireless presentation and display systems. And, a 2018 variant was used to launch a series of DDoS campaigns against financial-sector businesses.Researchers said that the biggest takeaway here is that connected devices continue to pose a security problem for users. They strongly advised customers to apply patches whenever possible.\u201cThe IoT realm remains an easily accessible target for attackers,\u201d according to Unit 42\u2019s report. \u201cMany vulnerabilities are very easy to exploit and could, in some cases, have catastrophic consequences.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:March 24:\u00a0Economics of 0-Day Disclosures: The Good, Bad and Ugly (Learn more and register!)April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)IoTMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered what they say is the first variant of the Gafgyt botnet family to cloak its activity using the Tor network.Gafgyt, a\u00a0botnet that was uncovered in 2014, has become infamous for launching large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Researchers first discovered activity from the newest variant, which they call Gafgyt_tor, on Feb. 15.In order to evade detection, Gafgyt_tor uses Tor to hide its command-and-control (C2) communications, and encrypts sensitive strings in the samples. The use of Tor by malware families is nothing new;\u00a0however, researchers said they haven\u2019t seen Gafgyt leveraging the anonymity network until now.\u201cCompared with other Gafgyt variants, the biggest change of Gafgyt_tor is that the C2 communication is based on Tor, which increases the difficulty of detection and blocking,\u201d said researchers with NetLab 360 on Thursday. \u201cThe Tor-based C2 communication mechanism has been seen in other families we have analyzed before\u2026 but this is the first time we encountered it in the Gafgyt family.\u201dGafgyt_tor Botnet:\u00a0Propagation and New FunctionalitiesThe botnet is mainly propagated through weak Telnet passwords \u2013 a common issue on internet of things devices \u2013 and through exploiting three vulnerabilities.\u00a0These vulnerabilities include a remote code execution flaw (CVE-2019-16920) in D-Link devices; a remote code execution vulnerability in Liferay enterprise portal software (for which no CVE is available); and a flaw (CVE-2019-19781) in Citrix Application Delivery Controller.Researchers said that the code structure of Gafgyt_tor\u2019s main function \u2013 which adds the Tor proxy function to provide the\u00a0IP server\u2019s address \u00a0\u2013 shows widespread changes.\u201cThe original initConnection() function, which is responsible for establishing the C2 connection, is gone, replaced by a large section of code responsible for establishing the Tor connection,\u201d they said.New Tor Capabilities, CommandsWithin this large section of code exists tor_socket_init, a function that is responsible for initializing a list of proxy nodes with IP addresses and a port. Researchers said that over 100 Tor proxies can be built in in this way \u2013 and new samples are continually updating the proxy list.The new versus old code structure for the Gafgyt variant. Credit: NetLab 360\u201cAfter initializing the proxy list, the sample will select a random node from the list to enable Tor communication via tor_retrieve_addr and tor_retrieve_port,\u201d said researchers.After it establishes a connection with the C2, the botnet requests wvp3te7pkfczmnnl.onion through the darknet, from which it then awaits commands.\u201cThe core function of Gafgyt_tor is still DDoS attacks and scanning, so it mostly follows the common Gafgyt directive,\u201d said researchers. They noted, a new directive called LDSERVER has been added to the botnet, which allows the C2 to quickly specify servers from which the payloads are downloaded. This allows attackers to quickly switch courses should an attacker-owned download server be identified and blocked, said researchers.\u201cThis directive means that C2 can dynamically switch download servers, so that it can quickly switch to a new download server to continue propagation if the current one is blocked,\u201d said researchers,Links to Freak Threat Actor, Other BotnetsResearchers said that the variant shares the same origin with the Gafgyt samples distributed by a threat group that NetLab 360 researchers call the keksec group, and that other researchers call the Freak threat actor. They said, the keksec group reuses code and IP addresses between various other bot families, including the Tsunami botnet as well as the Necro botnet family uncovered in January.\u201cWe think that Gafgyt_tor and Necro are very likely operated by the same group of people, who have a pool of IP addresses and multiple botnet source codes, and have the ability of continuous development,\u201d said researchers. \u201cIn actual operation, they form different families of botnets, but reuse infrastructure such as IP address.\u201dOther Gafgyt Botnet VariantsGafgyt.tor is only the latest variant of the popular botnet to come to light. In 2019, researchers warned of a new Gafgyt variant adding vulnerable IoT devices to its botnet arsenal and using them to cripple gaming servers worldwide.In 2018, researchers said they discovered new variants for the Mirai and Gafgyt IoT botnets\u00a0targeting well-known vulnerabilities in Apache Struts and SonicWall; as well as a separate attack actively launching two IoT/Linux botnet campaigns, exploiting the CVE-2018-10562 and CVE-2018-10561 bugs in Dasan routers.More recently, last year a botnet called\u00a0Hoaxcalls emerged, as a variant of the Gafgyt family. The botnet, which can be marshalled for large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns, is spreading via an unpatched vulnerability impacting the ZyXEL Cloud CNM SecuManager.IoTMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Thousands of organizations remain at risk from the URGENT/11 and CDPwn collections of vulnerabilities, which affect operational technology (OT) gear and internet of things (IoT), respectively. Unfortunately, there has been a rampant lack of patching, researchers said.According to researchers at Armis, a whopping 97 percent of the OT devices impacted by URGENT/11 have not been patched, despite fixes being delivered in 2019. And, 80 percent of those devices affected by CDPwn remain unpatched.URGENT/11 is a collection of 11 different bugs that can affect any connected device leveraging Wind River\u2019s VxWorks that includes an IPnet stack (CVEs from Wind River available here). VxWorks is a real-time operating system (RTOS) that third-party hardware manufacturers have embedded in more than 2 billion devices across industrial, medical and enterprise environments.Click to register.Affected devices, including programmable logic controllers from Schneider Electric and Rockwell Automation, are typically used in production and manufacturing environments to carry out various mission-critical tasks, such as monitoring and control of physical devices that operate various instruments (e.g motors, valves, pumps, etc.).Most concerningly, URGENT/11 includes six remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerabilities that could give an attacker full control over a targeted device, via unauthenticated network packets.\u201cURGENT/11 could allow attackers to remotely exploit and take over mission critical devices, bypassing traditional perimeter and device security. Every business with these devices needs to ensure they are protected,\u201d said Yevgeny Dibrov, CEO and co-founder of Armis, when the bugs were discovered. \u201cThe vulnerabilities in these unmanaged and IoT devices can be leveraged to manipulate data, disrupt physical world equipment, and put people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201dCDPwn encompasses five critical vulnerabilities discovered in February in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), the info-sharing layer that maps all Cisco equipment on a network. The bugs can allow attackers with an existing foothold in the network to break through network-segmentation efforts and remotely take over millions of devices.CDP is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 network protocol that is used to discover information about locally attached Cisco equipment. CDP aids in mapping the presence of other Cisco products in the network and is implemented in virtually all Cisco products \u2013 including switches, routers, IP phones and IP cameras. Many of these devices cannot work properly without CDP, and do not offer the ability to turn it off, according to Armis.The lack of patching lays open critical environments to takeover, according to Ben Seri, vice president of research at Armis.\u201cThese devices are not simply used in everyday businesses but are core to our healthcare, manufacturing and energy industries,\u201d he said, in a recent blog post.The news comes as attackers continue to exploit the bugs. For instance, in October, the NSA identified one of the CDPwn flaws (CVE-2020-3118) as No. 24 on the list of the Top 25 vulnerabilities that are currently being consistently scanned, targeted and exploited by Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups.Some of the URGENT/11-affected manufacturers did not provide updates, Seri noted, but even for those that did, it is a labor-intensive program to update impacted devices because they tend to be mission-critical and taking them offline to patch is often not an option. Cisco meanwhile did provide patches for CDPwn at the time of disclosure.Seri note the increasingly common scenario where combining the CDPwn and URGENT/11 vulnerabilities represents a very serious risk to these environments\u2014giving attackers the opportunity to take over Cisco network equipment, move laterally across the network, and gain access to mission-critical devices like infusion pumps and PLCs.\u201cAn attacker can infiltrate a network, lie in wait, and conduct reconnaissance undetected, then execute an attack that could cause significant financial or property damage, impact production or operations, or impact patient delivery and care,\u201d he warned.To protect themselves, organizations should patch wherever possible, but should also strive for complete visibility of their device footprint, behavioral analysis of the activity of those devices, and a capability to remediate issues or isolate compromised devices, Seri said.\u201cMost of the IT, internet of medical things (IoMT), OT and IoT devices lack any means of installing cybersecurity software or agents, which means you need to have agentless protection capable of discovering every device in the environment and detecting vulnerable code on devices,\u201d Seri added. \u201cYou should also be able to map connections from devices throughout your network and detect anomalies in behavior that indicate suspicious or malicious behavior or communications so you can take the appropriate action.\u201dPut Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows; Limor Kessem, Executive Security Advisor, IBM Security; and Allie Mellen, a security strategist in the Office of the CSO at Cybereason,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

        "raw text": "Researchers \u2013 as well as the U.S. Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) \u2013 are warning of a set of serious vulnerabilities affecting TCP/IP stacks. The flaws impact millions of internet-of-things (IoT) devices and embedded systems, including smart thermometers, smart plugs and printers.The 33 vulnerabilities \u2013 four of which are critical \u2013 are dubbed Amnesia:33 by Forescout researchers who discovered them. They could enable a range of malicious attacks \u2013 from memory corruption to denial of service, and information leaks to remote code execution, Forescout researcher Daniel dos Santos said during this week\u2019s Threatpost podcast.Listen to the full podcast, below, or download here.Also, check out our podcast microsite, where we go beyond the headlines on the latest news.\u201cExploiting these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to take control of a device, thus using it as an entry point on a network (for internet-connected devices), as a pivot point for lateral movement, as a persistence point on the target network or as the final target of an attack,\u201d Forescout researchers said in a Tuesday report.The name \u201cAmnesia:33\u201d refers to the fact that most of the flaws stem from memory corruption \u2013 coupled with the fact that there are 33 flaws.Click to register.While researchers did not specify which vendors and specific devices were affected by the set of vulnerabilities, they said at least 150 vendors were affected. Many of the issues behind Amnesia:33 stem from bad software development practices, such as an absence of basic input validation, said researchers.The flaws are found in four (out of seven analyzed) TCP/IP stacks (including uIP, picoTCP, FNET and Nut/Net), which are a set of communication protocols used by internet-connected devices. Because multiple open-source TCP/IP stacks are affected, which are not owned by a single company, it presents tough patch management challenges for Amnesia:33, warned researchers.TCP/IP issues have previously been found with related vulnerability sets, Ripple20 and Urgent/11.While four TCP/IP stacks were affected, researchers warn that several of these stacks have branched out or are used in multiple code bases, posing further patch management difficulties.\u201cDespite much effort from all the parties, official patches were only issued by the Contiki-NG, PicoTCP-NG, FNET and Nut/Net projects,\u201d said researchers. \u201cAt the time of writing, no official patches have been issued for the original uIP, Contiki and PicoTCP projects, which we believe have\u00a0 reached end-of-life status but are still available for download. Some of the vendors and projects using\u00a0 these original stacks, such as open-iscsi, issued their own patches.\u201dIn terms of mitigation, researchers recommend various coursees of action in protecting networks from the Amnesia:33 TCP/IP flaws, including disabling or blocking IPv6 traffic when it\u2019s not necessary; configuring devices to rely on internal DNS servers as much as possible; and monitoring all network traffic for malformed packets that try to exploit known flaws.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows, and Israel Barak, CISO at Cybereason,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

        "raw text": "Advantech, the chip manufacturer, has confirmed that it received a ransom note from a Conti ransomware operation on Nov. 26 demanding 750 Bitcoin, which translates into about $14 million, to decrypt compromised files and delete the data they stole.Just to let Advantech know they weren\u2019t bluffing, the scammers published a list of files from a stolen .zip archive on their leak site. The ransom note claimed that the 3.03GB of data posted on the leak site accounted for about 2 percent of the total amount of data lifted ripped off from Advantech.Advantech specializes in internet-of-things (IoT) intelligent systems, Industry 4.0, machine automation, embedded computing, embedded systems, transportation and more.A statement provided to Bleeping Computer on behalf of Advantech acknowledged the attack and said \u201cthe stolen data was confidential but only contained low-value documents.\u201d The statement added that the company is recovering and \u201cfunctioning normally,\u201d and will not be commenting on whether the ransom was paid.Ransomware Leak Sites Professionalized ransomware groups including Conti, Ragnar Locker, Maze, Clop and others have been exploiting security holes created by the emergency shift to remote work due to the pandemic, coupled with well-publicized leak sites to wreak havoc and wring millions out of unsuspecting companies like Advantech. And in the case of Advantech, the longer it waits to decide, the more expensive the ransom gets.\u201cIn August 2020, the Conti ransomware group created a data leak website, called Conti.News, following the trend of other highly successful ransomware variants, such as Maze, Sodinokibi and NetWalker,\u201d Digital Shadows threat researcher Kacey Clark told Threatpost. \u201cThe group\u2019s ransom demands require victims to make their payments in Bitcoin, and for each day a victim does not contact the attackers, the ransom demand increases by BTC 0.5.\u201dClark added that Conti ransomware was likely developed by the same group behind Ryuk ransomware.\u201cRyuk version 2 code and Conti ransomware code maintain notable similarities, the Conti ransom note uses the same template utilized in early Ryuk ransomware attacks and Conti ransomware operators appear to leverage the same TrickBot infrastructure used in Ryuk ransomware attacks,\u201d she said.Ransomware Rising\u00a0 Kaspersky researchers released a report Monday that said ransomware will be one of cybersecurity\u2019s biggest threats in the year ahead, and pointed specifically to leak sites as the single biggest factor driving up ransom prices.\u201cDue to their successful operations and extensive media coverage this year, the threat actors behind targeted ransomware systematically increased the amounts victims were expected to pay in exchange for not publishing stolen information,\u201d Kaspersky researchers said. \u201cThis point is important because it is not about data encryption anymore, but about disclosing confidential information exfiltrated from the victim\u2019s network. Due to payment card industry security and other regulations, leaks like this may result in significant financial losses.\u201dIt\u2019s up to organizations to shore up their defenses in preparation for the next inevitable ransomware attack, researchers noted.Ransomware Defenses The first line of defense is a regular, smart backup strategy, according to Shawn Smith, DevOps engineer at nVisium.\u201cAttacks like this are why proper backups and disaster recovery plans are so vital,\u201d Smith said in an email to Threatpost. \u201cIn the unfortunate event a breach manifests, as long as you have proper backups, you can restore files, resume operations and start to mitigate the fallout. Attackers aren\u2019t trustworthy given the nature of what they do, and if you put yourself in a situation where you\u2019re forced to pay them money, your results may vary wildly depending on the group you have to deal with.\u201dBesides regular data backups, basics like security awareness training, patching and antivirus protection are all key, according to Daniel Norman, senior solutions analyst at the Information Security Forum. He also recommended that organizations train for ransomware response.\u201cOrganizations should have an incident-response or crisis-management plan for ransomware events, knowing who to contact and what to do,\u201d Norman advised. \u201cThis should be regularly rehearsed so that if ransomware hits, the organization can recover swiftly.\u201dAnd while those preparations seem wise, what about companies stuck without either a backup or a strategy? Then it comes down to which costs more, recovery or the ransom?\u201cPayment of a ransom is also a contentious discussion \u2013 in many cases the ransom may be cheaper than replacing a suite of locked devices,\u201d Norman said. \u201cTherefore, it becomes a cost-decision. However, you can never trust that the attacker will unlock the devices, so it remains a grey area.\u201dPut Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.

        "raw text": "Security experts are applauding the recent stamp of approval by the U.S. Senate on a groundbreaking internet-of-things (IoT) security regulatory effort.The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act, which was led in bipartisan sponsorship by Reps. Will Hurd (R-Texas) and Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), would require the federal procurement and use of IoT devices to conform to basic security requirements. The act was unanimously passed by the House in September, and by the Senate earlier this week; the next step is for it to be sent to the president to be signed into law.Security stalwarts praised the bill\u2019s alignment with existing standards and best practices, as well as its meaning for IoT devices \u2013 which have long been plagued by security and privacy issues.\u201cThrough the Act, the federal government can lead by example in implementing basic IoT security standards and best practices for devices it buys and manages, and drive contractors\u2019 adoption of standards-based coordinated vulnerability disclosure processes,\u201d according to\u00a0Harley Geiger, director of Public Policy at Rapid7, in a recent post.The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act\u00a0The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act has several different parts. First, it mandates that NIST must issue standards-based guidelines for the minimum security of IoT devices that are owned by the federal government. \u00a0The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must also implement requirements for federal civilian agencies to have information-security policies that are consistent with these NIST guidelines.Under the law, federal agencies must also implement a vulnerability-disclosure policy for IoT devices, and they cannot procure devices that don\u2019t meet the security guidelines.Of note, NIST has been developing \u201cconsiderations\u201d for manufacturer-based IoT security measures, which they have recommended since 2019. And, NIST\u2019s EU counterpart, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), has already published baseline security recommendations\u00a0for IoT devices.Rapid7\u2019s Geiger said that he hopes the bill signals strengthened commitment from the U.S. federal government to work on IoT security.\u201cWhile we support strong IoT security, we believe it is best implemented in a coordinated manner, avoiding a patchwork between U.S. states or internationally,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will take sustained engagement from both the public and private sectors, but the passage of the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act and the lessons to be learned in its implementation will be invaluable to this process.\u201dIoT Regulatory EffortsRegulatory efforts worldwide continue to solidify, including a California Senate Bill 327 (SB-327), which requires \u201creasonable security feature or features that are appropriate to the nature and function of the device.\u201d SB-327 was first proposed in 2018 and became effective in January (although it did draw backlash\u00a0from the security community for not going far enough).Meanwhile, in 2019 the\u00a0U.K. government announced a mandate promising new requirements for IoT manufacturers. Those include improvements around unique device passwords and policies around security updates.\u201cFixing IoT security requires a concerted effort across the supply chain, not on fixing a singular technology or vulnerability. Establishing better standards and accountability for securing devices and their software is a positive development,\u201d Jack Mannino, CEO at nVisium, told Threatpost. \u201cMany devices have remained plagued by vulnerabilities for years, and if we want to do a better job in the future, we have to start now.\u201dDirk Schrader, global vice president at New Net Technologies (NNT), said that security measures like the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act \u201cimproves the security posture overall.\u201d\u201cHaving basic cybersecurity requirements in place that vendors need to adhere to for any kind of internet-connected device is a good move,\u201d Schrader told Threatpost. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how this is enforced and monitored, as we have already a few of these requirements out there, like the HIPAA security rule.\u201dIoTVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have uncovered a new worm targeting Linux based x86 servers, as well as Linux internet of things (IoT) devices (that are based on ARM and MIPS CPUs).Of note, the malware utilizes\u00a0GitHub and Pastebin for housing malicious component code, and has\u00a0at least 12 different attack modules available \u2013 leading researchers to call it \u201cGitpaste-12.\u201d\u00a0It was first detected by Juniper Threat Labs in attacks on Oct. 15, 2020.\u201cNo malware is good to have, but worms are particularly annoying,\u201d said researchers with Juniper Threat Labs in a Thursday post. \u201cTheir ability to spread in an automated fashion can lead to lateral spread within an organization or to your hosts attempting to infect other networks across the internet, resulting in poor reputation for your organization.\u201dThe first phase of the attack is the initial system compromise. The malware\u2019s various attack modules include 11 previously-disclosed vulnerabilities. That includes flaws in Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638), Asus routers (CVE-2013-5948), Webadmin plugin for opendreambox (CVE-2017-14135) and Tenda routers (CVE-2020-10987).The malware will attempt to use known exploits for these flaws to compromise systems and may also attempt to brute force passwords, said researchers. After compromising a system, a main shell script is then uploaded to the victim machine, and starts to download and execute other components of Gitpaste-12.The Malware This script sets up a cron job it downloads from Pastebin. A cron job is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. The cron job calls a script and executes it again each minute; researchers believe that this script is presumably one mechanism by which updates can be pushed to the botnet.It then downloads a script from GitHub (https://raw[.]githubusercontent[.]com/cnmnmsl-001/-/master/shadu1) and executes it. The script contains comments in the Chinese language and has multiple commands available to attackers to disable different security capabilities. These include stripping the system\u2019s defenses, including firewall rules, selinux (a security architecture for LinuxR systems), apparmor (a Linux kernel security module that allows the system administrator to restrict programs\u2019 capabilities), as well as common attack prevention and monitoring software.The 11 vulnerabilities utilized for Gitpaste-12\u2019s initial attack vectors. Credit: Juniper LabsThe malware also has some commands that disable cloud security agents, \u201cwhich clearly indicates the threat actor intends to target public cloud computing infrastructure provided by Alibaba Cloud and Tencent,\u201d said researchers.Gitpaste-12 also features commands allowing it to run a cryptominer that targets the Monero cryptocurrency.\u201cIt also prevents administrators from collecting information about running processes by intercepting \u2018readdir\u2019 system calls and skip directories for processes like tcpdump, sudo, openssl, etc. in \u2018/proc\u2019,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThe \u2018/proc\u2019 directory in Linux contains information about running processes. It is used, for example, by the \u2018ps\u2019 command to show information about running processes. But unfortunately for this threat actor, this implementation does not do what they expect it to do.\u201dFinally, the malware also contains a library (hide.so) that is loaded as LD_PRELOAD, which downloads and executes Pastebin files )https://pastebin[.]com/raw/Tg5FQHhf) that host further malicious code.Researchers said they reported the Pastebin URL, as well as the Git repo mentioned above that downloads malicious scripts for the malware. The Git repo was closed on Oct. 30, 2020. \u201cThis should stop the proliferation of this botnet,\u201d said researchers.Wormable FeaturesIn terms of its worming capabilities, Gitpaste-12 also contains a script that launches attacks against other machines, in an attempt to replicate and spread the malware.\u201cThe malware chooses a random /8 CIDR for attack and will try all addresses within that range,\u201d according to researchers. \u00a0Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for allocating IP addresses and for IP routing \u2013 meaning that the attack targets all IP addresses within the random CIDR\u2019s range.Another version of the script also opens ports 30004 and 30005 for reverse shell commands, said researchers. Port 30004 uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is one of the main protocols in TCP/IP networks; while port 30005\u00a0is a bidirectional SOAP/HTTP-based protocol, which provides communication between devices like\u00a0routers or network switches, and auto-configuration servers.Worms can have a\u00a0widespread impact, as seen in a 2019 campaign that exploited a vulnerability in the Exim mail transport agent (MTA) to gain remote command-execution on victims\u2019 Linux systems, using a wormable exploit. Researchers said that currently more than 3.5 million servers were at risk from the attacks.Several new worms have popped up in 2020 so far, including the Golang worm, which is\u00a0aimed at installing cryptominers, and recently changed up its tactics to add attacks on Windows servers and a new pool of exploits to its bag of tricks.In August, a\u00a0cryptomining worm from the group known as TeamTNT was found spreading through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud and collecting credentials. Once the logins are harvested, the malware logs in and deploys the XMRig mining tool to mine Monero cryptocurrency.Hackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "Connected cameras, refrigerators and other seemingly-mundane internet-of-things (IoT) devices are a cybercriminal favorite this year, with new research showing a sharp increase (100 percent) in IoT infections observed on wireless networks.IoT devices are now responsible for 32.72 percent of all infections observed in mobile and Wi-Fi networks \u2013 up from 16.17 percent in 2019. And researchers with Nokia\u2019s Threat Intelligence Lab said, in the Threat Intelligence Report 2020 released this week, that they believe that number of IoT infections will continue to grow \u201cdramatically\u201d as connected devices continue to populate in homes and enterprise settings alike.\u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that IoT devices are the crown jewels for cybercriminals,\u201d Dirk Schrader, global vice president at New Net Technologies, told Threatpost. \u201cBusinesses around the world are transforming their processes, their production lines using digitalized assets. Having control over these assets means that a cybercriminal\u2019s hand is \u2013 literally \u2013 at the main switch of a digitally transformed company. \u201dIoT devices are even a target for ransomware, he added: \u201cThe danger of being shut down almost completely is the reason why companies are more likely to pay even higher ransoms.\u201dResearchers pointed to the visibility of devices connected to the internet as a barometer for IoT infection rates, with high IoT infection rates occurring when devices are connected to publicly facing internet IP addresses. In networks where carrier grade network address translation (NAT) is enabled on a firewall or router, the infection rate is reduced, as the connected devices are not visible to network scanning, they said. While standard NAT translates a private IPv4 address to public IPv4 address, carrier-grade adds an additional translation layer as an extra security measure.There are more and more devices for cybercriminals to scan: Brandon Hoffman, CISO at Netenrich, pointed out that due to the pandemic, people are also not spending money on vacations and therefore buying more connected \u201cthings\u201d for their homes.\u201cAs devices at home and other \u2018things\u2019 become smarter, and have computing capacity they don\u2019t need, cybercriminals can snap that computing power up and use it to perform attacks, transfer data anonymously, and store it in places people aren\u2019t looking,\u201d Hoffman told Threatpost.Overall, in 2020, Android devices were the most commonly targeted by malware, researchers found, making up 26.64 percent of all infections. Meanwhile, Windows devices and PCs, which are increasingly connected to mobile networks via USB dongles and Wi-Fi, made up 38.92 percent.Researchers said that the coronavirus pandemic caused a surge (a 30 percent increase over 2019, specifically) in mobile-malware infections, saying the volume and type of attacks have also seen \u201cprofound\u201d changes.\u201cThe situation is certainly worsened during the pandemic, as the IT operations and information security teams had to organize, setup and secure a remote workforce more or less in no time,\u201d Schrader said. \u201cPlans for digital transformation need to be altered to reflect this \u2018new normal,\u2019 and such the problem is likely to worsen.\u201dIoT devices have long been under scrutiny for their lack of security measures, with researchers finding in March that more than half of all IoT devices are vulnerable to medium- or high-severity attacks, for instance.In September, \u00a0researchers found a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) vulnerability that impacted billions of IoT devices and remained unpatched in Android devices. And in August, researchers urged connected-device manufacturers to ensure they applied patches addressing a flaw in a module used by millions of IoT devices.Meanwhile, the growth in IoT is far from over: The introduction of 5G is also expected to continue to increase not just the number of IoT devices, but the share of connected devices accessible directly from the internet.\u00a0HacksIoTVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Google and Intel are warning of a high-severity flaw in BlueZ, the Linux Bluetooth protocol stack that provides support for core Bluetooth layers and protocols to Linux-based internet of things (IoT) devices.Click to Register!According to Google, the vulnerability affects users of Linux kernel versions before 5.9 that support BlueZ.\u00a0BlueZ, which is an open-source project distributed under GNU General Public License (GPL), features the BlueZ kernel that has been part of the official Linux kernel since version 2.4.6.The flaw, which Google calls \u201cBleedingTooth,\u201d can be exploited in a \u201czero-click\u201d attack via specially crafted input, by a local, unauthenticated attacker. This could potentially allow for escalated privileges on affected devices.\u201cA remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim\u2019s bd [Bluetooth] address can send a malicious l2cap [Logical Link Control and Adaptation Layer Protocol] packet and cause denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges,\u201d according to a Google post on Github. \u201cMalicious Bluetooth chips can trigger the vulnerability as well.\u201dThe flaw (CVE-2020-12351) ranks 8.3 out of 10 on the CVSS scale, making it high-severity. It specifically stems from a heap-based type confusion in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c. A type-confusion vulnerability is a specific bug that can lead to out-of-bounds memory access and can lead to code execution or component crashes that an attacker can exploit. In this case, the issue is that there is insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the BlueZ implementation in Linux kernel.Intel, meanwhile, which has placed \u201csignificant investment\u201d in BlueZ,\u00a0addressed the security issue in a Tuesday advisory, recommending that users update the Linux kernel to version 5.9 or later.\u201cPotential security vulnerabilities in BlueZ may allow escalation of privilege or information disclosure,\u201d according to the security advisory. \u201cBlueZ is releasing Linux kernel fixes to address these potential vulnerabilities.\u201dGoogle has also published proof-of-concept exploit code for the flaw on GitHub. See a video demo of BleedingTooth below:Intel also issued a fix for two medium-severity flaws that affect BlueZ, both of which stem from improper access control. That includes CVE-2020-12352, which could enable an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via adjacent access.\u201cA remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim\u2019s bd address can retrieve kernel-stack information containing various pointers that can be used to predict the memory layout and to defeat KASLR,\u201d according to a description on GitHub. \u201cThe leak may contain other valuable information such as the encryption keys.\u201dAnother flaw (CVE-2020-24490) could allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable denial of service via adjacent access. The flaw can be exploited by a remote attacker in short distance, who can broadcast extended advertising data and cause a denial-of-service state, or possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges on victim machines (if they are equipped with Bluetooth 5 chips and are in scanning mode), according to Google.Andy Nguyen, security engineer with Google, was credited with discovering the flaw.

        "raw text": "A team of academic researchers have discovered a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) vulnerability that allows spoofing attacks that could affect the way humans and machines carry out tasks. It potentially impacts billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, researchers said, and remains unpatched in Android devices.The BLE Spoofing Attacks (BLESA) flaw arises from authentication issues in the process of device reconnection \u2014 an area often overlooked by security experts. Reconnections occur after two devices are connected and then one moves out of range (or disconnects) and then connects again, according to a paper published recently by researchers at Purdue University. Reconnections are common in industrial IoT environments, for example, where sensors may periodically connect to a server to transmit telemetry data, for instance, before disconnecting and going into monitoring mode.A successful BLESA attack allows bad actors to connect with a device (by getting around reconnection authentication requirements) and send spoofed data to it. In the case of IoT devices, those malicious packets can convince machines to carry out different or new behavior. For humans, attackers could feed a device deceptive information.The vulnerability is particularly significant due to the ubiquity of the BLE protocol which, because of its energy efficiency and simplicity of use, is used by billions of devices to pair and connect, said the team\u2014comprised of researchers Jianliang Wu, Yuhong, Vireshwar, Dave (Jing) Tian, Antonio Bianchi, Mathias Payer and Dongyan Xu.Click to register.\u201cTo ease its adoption, BLE requires limited or no user interaction to establish a connection between two devices,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, this simplicity is the root cause of several security issues.\u201dThe paper describes the ease with which an attacker can launch a BLESA attack: A threat actor, upon discovering the server to which a BLE-enabled device is connected, also pairs with it to it to obtain its attributes. This is easy because the BLE protocol is designed to allow any device to connect with another BLE device to get this info, researchers wrote.BLE further facilitates access for an attack because its advertising packets are always transmitted in plain-text, so an attacker can easily impersonate the benign server by advertising the same packets and cloning its MAC address, they said.In an attack\u2019s next phase, the threat actor starts broadcasting spoofed advertising packets to ensure that whenever the client attempts to start a new session with the previously-paired server, it receives the spoofed advertising packets, researchers explained.\u201cAt this point, the adversary is ready to launch BLESA against the client,\u201d they wrote.The paper focuses on two critical weaknesses in the BLE spec that allow for BLESA attacks. One of the issues occurs if the authentication during the device reconnection is marked as optional instead of mandatory. \u201cThe client and the server may choose to disable [authentication] for a specific attribute,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cTherefore, in the case of the basic attribute, the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity goals of the attribute-access request and response can be violated.\u201dThe other weakness arises because the specification provides two possible authentication procedures when the client reconnects with the server after pairing, meaning that authentication can potentially be circumvented, said researchers, who describe both types of attacks in detail in the paper.Attackers can use BLESA on BLE implementations on Linux, Android and iOS platforms, researchers said. Specifically, Linux-based BlueZ IoT devices, Android-based Fluoride and the iOS BLE stack are all vulnerable, while Windows implementations of BLE remain unaffected, they said.Researchers contacted Apple, Google and the BlueZ team about the vulnerabilities, with Apple assigning CVE-2020-9770 to the flaw and fixing it in June, they noted. However, \u201cthe Android BLE implementation in our tested device (i.e., Google Pixel XL running Android 10) is still vulnerable,\u201d they said.The BlueZ development team said it would replace the code that opens its devices to BLESA attacks with code that uses proper BLE reconnection procedures that aren\u2019t susceptible to attacks, according to researchers.This is the second major bug found in Bluetooth this month. Last week, the \u201cBLURtooth\u201d flaw was announced, which allows attackers within wireless range to bypass authentication keys and snoop on devices in man-in-the-middle attacks.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.\u00a0\u00a0Critical InfrastructureIoTMobile SecurityVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Details tied to a pair of remote code execution bugs in Microsoft\u2019s IoT security platform called Azure Sphere were released Monday. Also made public were specifics associated with two additional privilege escalation flaws impacting the same cloud security platform.Public disclosure of all four of the bugs piggyback on six vulnerabilities found in July also impacting Microsoft\u2019s Azure Sphere. Cybersecurity researchers at Cisco Talos found each of the bugs and released the technical details of the vulnerabilities only after Microsoft issued patches.\u201cCisco Talos worked with Microsoft to ensure that these issues are resolved and that an update is available for affected customers. However, Microsoft declined to issue any CVEs,\u201d according to a research brief published Monday.\nAzure Sphere, which debuted at the RSA Conference 2018, is Redmond\u2019s IoT security solution designed to secure microcontroller unit (MCU) devices typically found within IoT networks. The platform leverages MCUs with built-in security technology leveraging certificate-based authentication to protect against threats.The first of two code execution bugs disclosed on Monday is described as a \u201cnormal world application READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality unsigned code execution vulnerability\u201c. The TDLR version of the bug, impacting Azure Sphere 20.06, is that specially crafted shellcode introduced into the platform can cause a process\u2019 heap (data stored into memory) to become executable. For example, an \u201cattacker can execute a shellcode that sets the READ_IMPLIES_EXEC personality to trigger this vulnerability,\u201d according Cisco Talos.How severe is this vulnerability and the other remote code execution (RCE) bug?\u201cRemote code execution vulnerabilities can lead to complete system compromise. They need to be taken very seriously and patched when possible. In the event a severe issue cannot be patched a layered mitigation strategy needs to be in place,\u201d wrote Craig Williams, director Talos Outreach at Cisco, in an email interview.Reducing some concern is the fact that both the RCE bugs would be needed to be exploited locally and couldn\u2019t be triggered outside the trusted Azure Sphere environment.\u201cIn our attack scenario we assume that an attacker has already gained a foothold on the device and is using these vulnerabilities in order to execute remote unsigned code which according to Microsoft\u2019s security model is not something that should be possible,\u201d Williams said.The second code execution vulnerability outlined by researchers impacts Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.07 and is based on the assumption a local attacker can introduce a compromised application into the IoT ecosystem.\u201cA specially crafted shellcode can cause a process\u2019 non-writable memory to be written. An attacker can execute a shellcode that modifies the program at runtime via /proc/thread-self/mem to trigger this vulnerability,\u201d according to the Cisco Talos write-up.The vulnerability, according to researchers, can be exploited by an application that hides in Azure Sphere and executes a process within Microsoft\u2019s custom Linux-based OS \u2013 part of Azure Sphere. \u201cThe scope of this issue is within an already compromised application,\u201d researchers wrote. Pseudo-code, in this scenario, would be implemented via return oriented programming (ROP) gadgets.Pseudo-code is a way of writing programming code in plain English and is not actual programming language. ROP gadgets are discrete instruction sequences that can be chained together in an attack.\u201c[The] sequence of commands overwrites the function pointed by func with an arbitrary shellcode, and could be used by an attacker to run unsigned code, after compromising an application,\u201d researchers said.Cisco Talos researchers also disclosed two privilege escalation vulnerabilities, both rated high-severity and impacting Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.06. Both bugs are also patched.\u201cA privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Capability access control functionality,\u201d wrote researchers. \u201cA set of specially crafted ptrace syscalls can be used to obtain elevated capabilities. An attacker can write a shellcode to trigger this vulnerability.\u201dPtrace is jargon that describes a single system call and a system call is the action a computer program takes when requesting a service from the core of a computer\u2019s operating system (kernel).\u201cAn attacker can use the ptrace API to gain execution in another Azure Sphere process and use its Azure Sphere capabilities to access an entirely new set of IOCTL (input/output control) requests,\u201d Cisco Talos wrote.The second privilege escalation bug exploits a flaw in IoT devices and their unique identifier (UID) numbers.\u201cA privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the uid_map functionality of Microsoft Azure Sphere 20.06. A specially crafted uid_map file can cause multiple applications to get the same UID assigned, thus broadening the attack surface. An attacker can modify the uid_map file to trigger this vulnerability,\u201d according to the writeup.Each of the bugs disclosed Monday are credited to Claudio Bozzato, Dave McDaniel and \u201cLilith >_>\u201d of Cisco Talos.

        "raw text": "Researchers are urging connected-device manufacturers to ensure they have applied patches addressing a flaw in a module used by millions of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. If exploited, researchers speculated that the flaw could allow attackers to knock out a city\u2019s electricity or even overdose a medical patient.The vulnerability exists in a widely used Cinterion module, a small electronic device embedded in IoT devices that connects to wireless networks and sends and receives data. The module is manufactured by Thales, a French company that designs and builds electrical systems for aerospace markets.Researchers discovered the flaw in Cinterion\u2019s EHS8 module \u2013 however, further testing revealed that five other models in the same product line were also affected (BGS5, EHS5/6/8, PDS5/6/8, ELS61, ELS81, PLS62). The flaw could be exploited to steal confidential information, take control of devices, gain access to control networks and more.\u201c[The modules] store and run Java code, often containing confidential information like passwords, encryption keys and certificates,\u201d said Adam Laurie, with IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence, in a Wednesday post. \u201cUsing information stolen from the modules, malicious actors can potentially control a device or gain access to the central control network to conduct widespread attacks \u2013 even remotely via 3G in some cases.\u201dThe vulnerability (CVE-2020-15858) was first discovered last September, and Thales issued a fix in early 2020 \u2013 but while patches are available, researchers warn that it will take a while for many critical-infrastructure manufacturers to apply them to their devices. Researchers disclosed the flaw on Wednesday, after working with Thales \u201cto ensure users are aware of the patch and taking steps to secure their systems.\u201dResearchers found a way to bypass security checks that keep files or operational code hidden from unauthorized users.The flaw exists in the way that AT commands are processed by the module, Dan Crowley, research director at IBM X-Force Red, told Threatpost.\u00a0It is related to a string of Java code that counts the number of characters in the path substring.This string of code checks if the fourth character of a path substring is a dot. Normally, any attempt to access hidden files with a dot prefix will be denied (example: a:/.hidden_file) \u2013 However, replacing the slash with double slash (example: a://.hidden_file) will cause the condition to fail. An attacker could therefore use the dot-prefixed filename to bypass the security test condition.\u201cA real-world attacker could go wardialing to try to identify modems over the cellular network, attempting to issue the AT command that exploits the flaw,\u201d Crowley explained. \u201cSome of these will be the vulnerable module, and an attacker will then have an assortment of phone numbers and associated code retrieved from the device at that number. By inserting backdoors into the code and writing them back, the attacker would be in control of various IoT devices around the world. \u201dIf exploited, attackers could potentially access the wealth of confidential data stored by the modules. This may include \u00a0intellectual property (IP), credentials, passwords, encryption keys and more. And, due to the sheer breadth of connected devices that are powered by this module \u2013 from medical devices to connected utilities \u2013 researchers warn that the potential impact of the flaw could be dire if not patched.For instance, the flaw could be used in medical devices that leverage the module to manipulate readings from monitoring devices, to cover up concerning vital signs or create false panic.\u201cIn a device that delivers treatment based on its inputs, such as an insulin pump, cybercriminals could over- or underdose patients,\u201d said researchers.And in the utility space, it could be used to compromise smart meters to deliver falsified readings that increase or reduce a monthly bill.\u201cWith access to a large group of these devices through a control network, a malicious actor could also shut down meters for an entire city, causing wide-reaching blackouts that require individual repair visits, or, even worse, damage to the grid itself,\u201d said researchers.Vulnerabilities and security issues continue to plague connected devices \u2013 even as the number of internet-connected devices used globally is predicted to grow to 55.9 billion by 2025. \u00a0More than half of all IoT devices are vulnerable to medium- or high-severity attacks, meaning that enterprises are sitting on a \u201cticking IoT time bomb,\u201d researchers warned earlier this year.X-Force security researchers for their part said that this specific patch can be administered by IoT manufacturers in two ways \u2013 either by plugging in a USB to run an update via software, or by administering an over-the-air (OTA) update. However, the more heavily regulated devices, including connected medical devices or industrial-control gear, will have more difficulty applying the patch, since doing so may require recertification, an often time-intensive process, they said.\u201cThe patching process for this vulnerability is completely dependent on the manufacturer of the device and its capabilities \u2013 for example, whether the device has access to the internet could make it complicated to work with,\u201d they said.It\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

        "raw text": "We are currently experiencing the single largest explosion of network-enabled devices that we\u2019ve ever witnessed. Many of these devices are running on the same networks as critical business solutions and may even be connecting directly to critical assets or delivering a critical capability themselves.While these devices have a processor, an operating system, run software required to perform a function and communicate on networks, that is generally where the similarities with traditional IT devices (laptops, servers, and mobile devices) ends. The devices that I\u2019m referring to are categorized by many names including unmanaged, unagentable, IoT, and OT.Traditional solutions long used to assess and manage risks associated with IT devices fail to deliver the same value when facing this new form of device. These devices are typically walled off black boxes, designed with a real-time OS to deliver a specific outcome (versus a common IT OS that can be used to deliver many outcomes). They will not allow for the installation of other software, and rarely can configuration settings be adjusted in support of security. Even patch management is more complex than ever before; hundreds to thousands of unique devices spanning a nearly equally long list of unique manufacturers, most of which are running unique platforms with distinct management requirements. If patches are ever released, applying these patches is challenging at best and often involves proprietary tools that won\u2019t work at scale.Much of the rapid growth in the last couple of years is tied directly to digital transformation efforts within our organizations and the providers that deliver to our organization\u2019s needs. The need to make rapid business decisions and to deliver solutions that meet the needs of customers, deliver continuous uninterrupted service, and rapidly evolve to their highest priorities has resulted in the need to integrate IT and OT through IoT.New or enhanced experiences are being delivered to customers through modern technology that is ultimately being integrated with both newly developed products and decades-old technology running in our data centers, shop floors, retail facilities, medical operations, etc. As enterprises look to reduce operational expenses in support of sustained innovation and increased profitability into the future, devices ranging from predictive maintenance sensors, contact tracing devices to staff replacement devices are being implemented at an increasing rate as well.In terms of the latter, industry analysts are estimating that job automation and orchestration efforts will be accelerated as a result of the long-term enterprise response to the current health crisis. Enterprises are expected to assess the greatest points of failure in their supply chains and operations due to an inability for staff to perform the work safely and accelerate automation plans. In many industries and sectors, this will include the deployment and integration of even more unagentable devices.It\u2019s also worth noting that in 2020, progress towards regulations that define minimal security standards for manufactured devices remains very slow. When combined with device manufacturer economics optimized for cost and the fact that the market is demanding rapid outcomes over secure assets, the end result is that most devices continue to be manufactured without security in mind.Managing this risk while in my prior role as a Global CISO at a Fortune 100 organization was a top priority for me. An investigation into an event a few years back led to the realization that nearly every new piece of equipment entering our facilities were now network connected. Whether it was strategically beneficial to our operations or to one of our service providers, it was network-enabled, likely connected, and potentially even expecting to communicate with Internet services. It was everything.Attempts to use our existing stack of security capabilities, designed with traditional IT devices and assets in mind were failures in all cases. These solutions were lacking the context required to understand these devices and ultimately caused more work than the problems they solved. Segmentation as a lone strategy was quickly determined to be a no-go as well. We would only be able to segment the devices that we were aware of (a subset of all such devices) and those that were not required to interact with other business assets (an even smaller list).This ultimately led to our assessment of products developed from the ground up with IT and unagentable devices in mind; all without an agent, operating in a continuous manner and passively so as to take advantage of existing infrastructure and to avoid impacting business-critical devices. Once we assessed these modern offerings in our environment and compared them to current capabilities, we knew that we needed to grow our capabilities to manage IoT risks with a platform developed around the complete modern environment.Though the risk may be high and growing, the good news is that proven solutions are available, and many have been designed to be deployed rapidly and remotely. As we look to safeguard and enable accelerated digital transformation efforts, while also helping to maintain critical business operations in this shifting landscape, there\u2019s no better time than now to start developing this strategy.Web Security",

The top reward will come in at $100,000.The Azure Sphere Security Research Challenge is an expansion of a program unveiled at Black Hat last August. That program, Azure Security Lab, was an invite-only affair for researchers, who were asked to mimic criminal hackers within a special, non-customer-touching cloud environment.This time around, the challenge will run for three months, and will be application based: Bug-hunters need to submit an application to participate by May 15. The actual challenge then starts June 1 and will run through the end of August.A $100,000 bounty will be given \u201cfor specific scenarios\u201d: For instance, the ability to execute code on Pluton or on Secure World.Pluton is a secure boot hardware root of trust governing firmware and hardware. Pluton is also incidentally part of Microsoft\u2019s firmware protection for the Xbox gaming system.Secure World meanwhile is one of two operating environments found in the application processor\u2019s ARM Cortex-A subsystem, responsible for executing the operating system, applications and services (the other is called \u201cNormal World\u201d). Secure World executes only the Microsoft-supplied Security Monitor and other code.Other exploitation scenarios will earn existing public Azure Bounty Program awards, with a 20 percent bonus for finding critical bugs and a 10 percent bonus for vulnerabilities rated important.Microsoft said that eligible exploits include: The ability to either locally or remotely execute code on NetworkD; anything allowing execution of unsigned code that isn\u2019t pure return-oriented programming (ROP); ability to spoof device authentication; elevation of privilege outside of the capabilities described in the application manifest (e.g. changing user ID, adding access to a binary); ability to modify software and configuration options (except full device reset) on a device in the manufacturing state; and the ability to alter the firewall allowing communication out to other domains not in the app manifest (but not DNS poisoning).Microsoft is offering various resources to program participants, including the Azure Sphere development kit (DevKit); product documentation; direct communication channels with the Microsoft team; and other Microsoft products and services if needed.\u201cMicrosoft recognizes security is not a one-and-done event,\u201d wrote Sylvie Liu, security program manager at the Microsoft Security Response Center, in announcing the challenge this week. \u201cRisks need to be mitigated consistently over the lifetime of a constantly growing array of devices and services.

        "raw text": "A new botnet has been infecting internet of things (IoT) devices and Linux-based servers, to then leverage them in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The malware, dubbed Kaiji, has been written from scratch, which researchers say is \u201crare in the IoT botnet landscape\u201d today.Kaiji, which was discovered in late April by security researcher \u201cMalwareMustDie\u201d and researchers with Intezer, is unique in its custom tooling, created in the Golang programming language. Previous types of IoT malware have mainly derived their tooling from previous botnets (including multiple botnets that are variants of Mirai),\u00a0which are typically written in the C or C+ programming language.\u201cGolang is an easier language to program in than C and enables developers to build more code much more easily than to work with C,\u201d Paul Litvak, security researcher with Intezer, told Threatpost. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easier to build a tool from scratch than to edit an existing one. The malware developer probably felt more comfortable with code he wrote himself rather than relying on existing stuff.\u201dRather than relying on exploiting unpatched flaws, Kaiji spreads exclusively through brute-force attacks against publicly accessible SSH servers that allow password-based SSH authentication, said Litvak, in a Monday analysis.Only the \u201croot\u201d account is targeted, researchers said: \u201cAccessing root is important to its operation since some DDoS attacks are only available via crafting custom network packets. In Linux, custom network packets are only given to a privileged user such as root.\u201dOnce an SSH connection is established, a /usr/bin/lib directory is created and then Kaiji is installed under the filename \u2018netstat\u2019, \u2018ps\u2019, \u2018ls\u2019, or another system tool name.Kaiji has relatively simple features, and in fact, Litvak told Threatpost that he believes the tool is still being tested, due to one of its functions calling the tool a \u201cdemo.\u201d The malware\u2019s features include various DDoS attack modules, an SSH brute-forcer module to continue its spread, and another SSH spreader that hijacks local SSH keys to infect known hosts which the server has connected to in the past.Once the malware is executed, it copies itself to /tmp/seeintlog and launches various malicious operations, including decrypting command-and-control (C2) addresses and registering the newly infected server to one of the command servers.Finally, the botnet fetches commands from the C2 server with instructions for specific DDoS attacks. The botnet uses a variety of attacks, including TCP, UDP, SYN and ACK flood attack capabilities, as well as IP-spoofing capabilities.These types of attacks are common for botnets; UDP flood denial-of-service attacks, for instance, overwhelm random ports on the targeted host with IP packets containing User Datagram Protocol (UDP) datagrams; and TCP SYN DDoS attacks exploit part of the normal TCP three-way handshake to consume resources on the targeted server and render it unresponsive.Researchers believe the botnet has \u201cdefinitive Chinese origins,\u201d due to some functions being named in an English representation of Chinese words.Kaiji is only one of a recent slew of botnet strains to surface, including Dark_Nexus, MootBot\u00a0and the DDG botnet. \u00a0Unlike these previously discovered botnets, Kaiji has created its own custom tooling in Golang rather than using popular implants \u2013 which researchers say is a growing trend for malware developers.\u201cIt is rare to see a botnet written from scratch, considering the tools readily available to attackers in black-market forums and open-source projects,\u201d said researchers with Intezer. \u201cWe have uncovered a new DDoS operation in its early stages that was written from scratch. This is another confirmation of an interesting trajectory noted by vendors that malware developers are turning to modern languages such as Golang for their operations.\u201dInbox security is your best defense against today\u2019s fastest growing security threat \u2013 phishing and Business Email Compromise attacks.\u00a0On\u00a0May 13 at 2 p.m. ET, join Valimail security experts and Threatpost for a FREE webinar,\u00a05 Proven Strategies to Prevent Email Compromise.

        "raw text": "More than half of all internet of things (IoT) devices are vulnerable to medium- or high-severity attacks, meaning that enterprises are sitting on a \u201cticking IoT time bomb,\u201d according to Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 research team.In new research released Tuesday, researchers said that several deep-rooted issues exist around connected devices, both used by general enterprises and in medical environments. At the most basic level researchers found that 98 percent of all IoT device traffic is unencrypted, exposing personal and confidential data on the network.Other issues, like the reliance on outdated legacy protocols and operating systems, are opening up organizations up to older attack techniques that IT teams may not have had to deal with in years. For instance, researchers outlined one attack they discovered of a connected mammogram machine, used in a hospital, by the Conficker worm (malware first discovered more than a decade ago).Threatpost talks to Ryan Olson, vice president of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, and\u00a0May Wang, senior distinguished engineer at Palo Alto Networks and former Zingbox CTO, about the top IoT threats.Download the podcast directly here.See below for a lightly edited transcript of the podcast.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch: This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch and welcome everyone to this week\u2019s Threatpost Podcast.\u00a0Today we\u2019re talking about insecure IoT devices. We\u2019ve all seen it in the news over and over again \u2013 anything from privacy busting connected baby monitors, all the way to doorbells that can be hacked into, and even vulnerable connected surveillance cameras that are used in enterprises. Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42 team took a deep dive look at the security mess that is IoT devices in their 2020 IoT Threat Report, released Tuesday.\u00a0In this report Unit 42 analyzed security incidents throughout 2018 and 2019, spanning 1.2 million IoT devices in thousands of physical locations across enterprise IT and healthcare orgs in the United States.So here to talk about the IoT security landscape with me today is\u00a0Ryan Olson, the Vice President of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks and\u00a0May Wang, the Senior Distinguished Engineer at\u00a0Palo Alto Networks and former Zingbox CTO. Ryan and May thanks so much for joining me today.Ryan Olson: Thanks for having us.May Wang: Thank you.LO:\u00a0There was a lot that stuck out to me in this report, a lot of really interesting statistics. For one,\u00a098 percent of all IoT device traffic is unencrypted. But one\u00a0big takeaway for me is that you found that more than half of IoT devices are vulnerable to medium- or high-severity attacks, making IoT the low-hanging fruit for attackers.\u00a0And that speaks to an overall trend in the report about how the general security posture of IoT devices is leaving organizations vulnerable to new IoT-targeted malware and these older attack techniques that IT teams haven\u2019t had to deal with for a long time.\u00a0Can you talk a bit about the current state of IoT security and what you mean when you say that older attack techniques are cropping up to target these devices?RO:\u00a0I\u2019ll go ahead and jump in on that one, Lindsey. So this is Ryan. You know, the two stats that you just mentioned, I think really go hand in hand in answering your question. So 98 percent of IoT device traffic being unencrypted, meaning it\u2019s in the clear, anyone can go and see it if they are able to access it on that network, sort of gives you an indication around how the software and how the protocols for these are being done.\u00a0They\u2019re not being developed with the thought around security in mind necessarily, not thinking about the fact that this traffic should be encrypted, it needs to be hidden. And in the same way that staff around 57 percent of the devices being vulnerable to these medium or high severity attacks, in the same way these devices have insecure software or they\u2019ve been deployed in an insecure configuration, which does leave them vulnerable. Either they\u2019ve got software on them that there\u2019s a vulnerability that exists which hasn\u2019t been patched because the device maybe hasn\u2019t been patched in a long time, or maybe there\u2019s no patch available for it, or it has some sort of default password on it, which is widely known and it\u2019s easy to identify that this device could be compromised. These are the kinds of things that really, as the report describes, makes them low hanging fruit, the kind of thing that anyone if they wanted to, could poke at and get into, not like what we typically see in an IT environment where things do more regularly, get patched, have more up to date configurations, and have more defenses in place.MW: The good news is we do see increasing amounts of\u00a0IoT devices being deployed in organizations, whether that\u2019s general enterprises or in hospitals. At the same time, because we have so many IoT devices and so many different kinds of IoT devices, and each device can have different hardware, different software, different operating systems, different applications, different protocols. So we consider IoT environment is more of a heterogeneous environment, versus IT environment, which is more homogeneous environment, where we have relatively standard operating systems, relatively standard hardware. So, in order to protect these IoT devices, the traditional IoT device security mechanism are not as effective as they were before, because you cannot have one cross the board mechanism to protect all these devices. So we do see loss of increasing challenges to secure these IoT devices.LO:\u00a0Yeah, May, that\u2019s a really good\u00a0point and the research mentioned that a lot of IoT focused cyber attacks are kind of targeting these legacy protocols that you mentioned that there are all these different types of facets that are going into IoT applications. And I know the research mentioned that the OT protocols that were still being used, that are very old. Is that kind of the driver behind this increase in older attacks behind IoT devices, are there other types of causes behind that as well that are kind of driving this increase?MW: Yeah, that\u2019s actually a very key driving factor, because we do see different characteristics of these IoT devices compared to traditional IT devices. For example, lots of these IoT devices are in deployment for much longer lifespan compared to IT devices. We probably change our cell phones every other year.\u00a0We change our laptops every two, three years. But lots of these IoT devices, they\u2019re in mission critical positions. And they are in deployment, they can be in deployment for 10, 20 years without any updates. And there are lots of urgency to update these devices, whether it\u2019s software, whether it\u2019s operating systems, whether it\u2019s applications, but the challenge is because lots of these devices are in mission critical positions, and the last thing the operational team wants is to bring down their operational devices, so the downtime is the last thing anybody wants. So while the devices are still functioning, well, lots of organizations don\u2019t really patch these devices. Because also there are lots of examples that have already shown even though we tested the patches in the lab, very often when these patches are applied to these IoT devices in the real field, some how they bring down the devices. So for lots of various reasons, lots of these devices, first of all, they are in the field much longer, and they are not updated or patch.LO: Right. And I know you mentioned downtime, I feel like downtime is such a big issue for kind of operational technology, for industrial control systems and the industrial environment. And speaking of updates and patches, and the research also looked at medical IoT devices that are connected as well. And basically one really interesting angle here is that, you know, as a result, in part of Windows 7 operating system reaching its end of life, there was a huge number of medical imaging devices that are running on unsupported operating systems, that are leaving all of these connected devices vulnerable. I think was the stat was\u00a038 percent of medical imaging devices are running on unsupported OSes? I think that was it. So I thought that really shed some light into kind of at least for the medical space, the issues that connected medical devices are facing too due to that problem. So was there anything that stuck out to either of you in terms of the takeaways from a medical perspective? Because I know the research did go into the implications here for the medical and healthcare space that are using these connected IoT devices.MW: Yeah, because lots of these imaging systems are using Windows system as you mentioned, because Windows 7 is out of life this past January. So we do see from our data, we see 83 percent of medical imaging systems are using not supported operating systems and that is a severe\u00a0security issue, even though the number of imaging systems is not the number one in terms of quantity of medical devices we\u2019re seeing, but it is definitely the number one type of devices that bring in the most security issues. Actually, because of that last year NIST initiated a\u00a0project that we\u2019ve been honored to be selected as a partner to study the security issues of these medical imaging systems. Moving forward, we do think it is we actually for a foreseeable period of time we do see lots of these legacy systems are still going to be deployed, are still going to be used in daily operation to take images of patients to upload images. So we do see, there are two critical things that each organization can do. The first one is to know\u00a0what kind of devices you have, what kind of operating systems you\u2019re using, what kind of applications you\u2019re using, what kind of software you\u2019re using. And for that we think it\u2019s very important to be able to recognize each endpoint device, not just based on its IP address, but we need to know what kind of device that is. For example, you can have two endpoint devices that are both using Windows operating systems; one is your laptop, one can be an X-Ray machine, taking images for patients. If you only know this is a Windows system, then you can just apply generic security mechanisms to these devices, but if you know one of them is an X-Ray machine, then you know this X-Ray machine is not supposed to go out, browse the internet, it\u2019s not supposed to play YouTube. You\u2019re not supposed to play Pokemon Go on that. All that, a lot more strict\u00a0security measures should be applied on this particular device. \u00a0That\u2019s why we think a very important, critical first step is to know what kind of IoT devices you have in your network. And only once you have that visibility, then the second step, you can put the right security policies around these devices. So the second one we emphasize, is you do need to have 24-7 continuous monitoring of these devices, so that you can know what the normal behaviors these devices should carry, and whenever there\u2019s any abnormal behaviors, we can catch them easily.RO: Just to follow on Mays point around these devices, as well as the earlier point around patching. Patching is not the only solution that\u2019s available for trying to keep these devices secure. IoT devices have a life cycle that they pass through, and understanding that a device may be out of support, may not get any patches in the future doesn\u2019t mean you just have to say, hey, that device is insecure. Let\u2019s just live with that. You can do what May\u2019s describing, put it into an isolated VLAN, where it can\u2019t go and talk to other devices. The last thing you want in a hospital is your device that\u2019s connected, that\u2019s maybe used for medical imaging, on the same network as a doctor who\u2019s sitting down and opening phishing emails and maybe getting malware on his laptop. If you can isolate those devices, so they can\u2019t talk to each other, you can greatly reduce the risks that that critical device is going to be impacted by some sort of malware.LO: Right. Yeah. And, you know, in the research, speaking of kind of the situations and how you can handle these types of security issues, there was a really interesting kind of incident that you had highlighted, where Zingbox alerted one of the hospitals that they had a security issue with their mammogram that was being under \u2013\u00a0I believe it was attacked by the Conficker worm \u2013\u00a0Yeah, can you kind of talk a little bit more about that because I feel like that is a really good illustration of the how how these types of security issues can be handled.MW: Yes, while we were securing and monitoring one of our customers we notice one of the machines was exhibiting some abnormal behaviors and then we actually were able to identify this machine, it turned out to be a mammogram machine and then the organization brought down the machine and then reimaged the machine and after they put the reimaged machine back into operation, because we are doing continuous monitoring, and we notice abnormal behaviors again, and then turns out the image that was used to reimage this machine was not updated image, it was wasn\u2019t with the latest security patch. So after we identified that problem that this particular machine was taken down again, and\u00a0finally, was re-imaged by the latest operating systems image, and then brought back online.\u00a0And actually, while the machine was affected, it was connected online and we noticed it was affecting several other machines at the same time. So we notify the customer and the customer took down all the affected machines and used the latest image to update all these machines and brought all the machines back online. And after continuous monitoring, we notice all these machines were functioning well eventually.LO: Yeah, no, I just like to hear\u00a0incidents like that, because it kind of reflects that this is something that\u2019s happening in the real world and it kind of paints a picture of how these types of devices are actually being attacked.MW: So, yeah, that that is an interesting example, because Conficker is a very old malware in the IT world that we don\u2019t see as much as before, because lots of machines have been updated, have the latest patches, but surprisingly, in the IoT devices, we still see a significant amount of percentage of these medical imaging machines aren\u2019t carrying Conficker.LO: Right. And that goes back to the central theme here, which is that you are seeing these older attack techniques crop up to really target these IoT security flaws. So and I also had a question too, and just beyond the medical space, what were some of the newer IoT targeting malware strains that are really threatening the IoT landscape at this point, was there anything that stuck out to either view that you either saw as part of your research or are seeing going into 2020?RO: I think one in particular that\u2019s interesting is one that we call Gafget, which has largely been targeting wireless routers, things that are directly exposed to the internet. It\u2019s a variant of Mirai, which you might have heard of this now or that\u2019s scanning the internet looking for devices like routers, which are exposed the internet and oftentimes have lots of little vulnerabilities in them that have built up over time. And oftentimes Gafget and things like it and Mirai they build up a big botnet and then they\u2019re used to launch DDoS attacks in one direction or another take down gaming servers and other things. That\u2019s a common theme that we\u2019ve been seeing in the world of IoT. And that\u2019s definitely one that I expect to continue this year.LO: Yeah, definitely. And I do feel also like\u00a0DDoS attacks are getting bigger, they\u2019re longing, they\u2019re lasting longer. And so I think that that is certainly a big threat that is kind of opening up because of all these insecure IoT devices as well. And one other thing I wanted to kind of touch on is and, we mentioned this earlier, but how enterprises are really facing a lot of IoT devices. And as you guys mentioned, it\u2019s almost like they\u2019re \u201csitting on a time bomb\u201d of IoT devices, everything from IP phones, to printers, to cameras, to IoT gateways, and wearables. And as part of your research, you looked at some of these connected devices in the enterprise space and looked at not just how many there were, but \u00a0what kind of security they had. I thought that was a really\u00a0good approach to take when looking at enterprise connected IoT\u00a0deployments, what were some of the biggest takeaways that you found there?MW: We do see in general enterprises, even though the number one devices we\u2019re seeing are IP phones. But actually the type of device that brings in most security issues are cameras, all kinds of cameras, security cameras, surveillance cameras, and it\u00a0amounts to about 33 percent of security issues we\u2019ve seen among general enterprise IoT devices. And we do see these devices because they are different types of devices, they can have different normal behaviors. That\u2019s why we do see it is very important, not just use the traditional IT security, for example, it\u2019s not more or less like today\u2019s we\u2019re talking about coronavirus, originally we can identify the source of the virus and for people coming from all these highly affected countries, then we can quarantine them, and we can test them. But now, that doesn\u2019t work anymore. The same thing for IoT devices we cannot just rely on \u201cOkay, this is because of this camera, then it\u2019s definitely affected or is definitely not affected, or is only based on this IP address or a packet source address.\u201d But more\u00a0intelligently we need to continue monitoring all these devices, different behaviors, because for example, cameras can have different normal behaviors than Nest thermostats. So only once we know what their normal behavior is supposed to be, we know what kind of devices they are. And then whenever it does something abnormally, then we can detect them, we can catch them.LO:\u00a0I think to that there\u2019s almost like a lack of awareness about the types of connected devices that are in even just a regular office building like I know, when you think of a printer in your office that\u2019s connected, you might not think that it could provide access to print logs or open up as a lateral movement mechanism for other computers on your network or be used in a DDoS attack. So what can we really do to change the mindset of both enterprises or I guess people who are using these connected devices, as well as the manufacturers of the devices and the industry as a whole, so that we can all really better collaborate and recognize IoT security is a top priority that needs to be addressed?MW: I think that\u2019s exactly the purpose of this threat report, to make people be aware of the current IoT security challenges and how important this issue\u00a0is. We do see, because of special characteristics of these IoT devices, we do see the security of IoT devices is very important, not only because, if these devices are compromised, the data, the privacy will be affected. But also because lots of devices, these devices are in operations, if they are compromised, we can definitely impact the operations. And also because these devices are, as you mentioned, Lindsey, it\u2019s because these devices are connected to all the networks to IT network to our laptop to our\u00a0computers that carries sensitive information. So hackers can easily leverage these low-hanging fruits, these IoT devices, to become a stepping stone to more critical, sensitive information. And we do see now more and more organizations are paying more attention to IoT security.\u00a0And also we start seeing the policymakers are making a move towards this direction. For example, the latest regulation from California and several countries, including the U.S., NIST, and UK and Japan are all coming out of IoT security policies and guidelines. We certainly hope more and more organizations can put more resources and have the right mindset to protect these IoT devices, instead of having to wait till any disaster happens before we take actions.LO: Those are all really good points. And so, Ryan and May, just before we wrap up, is there any kind of final takeaways that you want to leave us with regarding either this IoT threat report or really what we can look forward to in terms of IoT threats in 2020?RO: For me, I think the\u00a0key takeaway is that managing your IoT security starts with visibility. If you don\u2019t know what all these little computers are inside your network, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to secure them. And then you need to manage all of those devices through their lifecycle. Every device has a lifecycle, you need to manage it, when it has patches that are available, whether it does in the future or not. And then through its eventual retirement. At some point, these devices will be retired, they won\u2019t be effective anymore, but you need to make sure that they\u2019re effective and secure the entire time that you have them inside your network.MW: Yeah, with the increasing amount of IoT devices deployed, now IoT devices are around us, all over the place. It brings tremendous amount of efficiency and convenience to our daily life. And the only way moving forward is to secure these devices so that these devices can better serve our daily life and daily work. And as increasing amount of IoT devices are being being deployed, we\u2019ll for sure, see more security issues among all these IoT devices. So for each organization, we need to have mechanism in place, we need to have the tools, the right kind of tools in place, because with these huge amount of IoT devices, and it\u2019s impossible to secure each one manually. So the right tools are very important to be able to identify these devices, to protect these devices, and to segment these devices in the correct way.LO: Absolutely. Well, Ryan, and May, thank you so much for joining me today and really kind of highlighting some of these top concerns and issues with IoT devices.RO: Thank you so much, Lindsey.MW:\u00a0 Thank you Lindsey.LO: Great.

The threat group warns that it will keep up attacks until the issue is resolved.On Monday, Lithuania\u2019s National Cyber Security Center (NKSC) under the Ministry of National Defense warned of intense and ongoing DDoS attacks against Lithuania\u2019s Secure National Data Transfer Network as well as other governmental institutions and private companies in the country.The attacks\u2014which the government expects to be ongoing as well as target other critical infrastructure in Lithuania\u2013disrupted access to services of users of the secure data network, the NKSC said in a public statement.\u201cIt is highly probable that such or even more intense attacks will continue into the coming days, especially against the communications, energy and financial sectors,\u201d Jonas Skardinskas, acting NKSC director and head of cyber security management department, said in a statement.Motivation for AttacksRussia-based Killnet apparently launched the attacks in response to the Lithuanian government\u2019s announcement on June 18 that it would close routes between the Baltic country and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad for transport of steel and other metals, according to Flashpoint, which published a blog post by the Flashpoint team on the attacks Monday.\u201cThese train routes, according to the Russian government, are essential in bringing in at least half of the exclave\u2019s imports, prompting Russian officials to label the move as a \u2018blockade\u2019 and warn of a harsh retaliation,\u201d a Flashpoint spokesperson wrote in an email to Threatpost.Meanwhile, Lithuania has justified the closure as a necessary requirement to fulfill the obligations of European Union (EU) sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine in late February, where the war is ongoing.On its Telegram channel, Killnet claimed that it would stop the attacks as soon as the Lithuanian government reinstates transit routes with Kaliningrad, according to Flashpoint.A spokesperson for Killnet group also told Reuters it plans to continue attacks until the blockade is lifted, adding that it has already \u201cdemolished 1652 web resources\u2013and that\u2019s just so far.\u201dCyber Attack as Political WeaponThere was some warning prior to the attacks that they were imminent, according to Flashpoint. Indeed, DDoS attacks have been a typical weapon of choice for Russian cyber actors since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, with Russian threat actors using them both before the war on the ground started and after alongside other cyber-attacks to support military operations. This year alone, Killnet reportedly already has targeted Romania, Moldova, Czech Republic and Italy with cyber-attacks.\u201cOn June 25, Flashpoint analysts observed chatter regarding a plan for a mass-coordinated attack to take place on June 27, which Killnet referred to as \u2018judgment day,'\u201d researchers wrote in the post. \u00a0In retrospect, they said that this conversation was likely a reference to Monday\u2019s attacks.Flashpoint researchers also observed\u00a0smaller attacks prior to Monday, including one that took place on June 22, they said. This appears to support Killnet\u2019s claim that the attacks were in retaliation to the closure of transit routes to Kaliningrad, researchers wrote.It also seems that Killnet is using the attacks against Lithuanian as a proving ground for new tools and tactics and even may be gearing up to team up with the Conti ransomware gang, according to Flashpoint.In a post from June 26, Killnet labeled Lithuania a \u201ctesting ground for our new skills\u201d and mentioned that their \u201cfriends from Conti\u201d are eager to fight. This pairing would make sense, as both groups had already expressed an allegiance to Russia at the beginning of the group\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, researchers said..No matter, it\u2019s clear now that cyber-attacks will be used as a frequent weapon\u2014albeit not necessarily a deadly one\u2013for the world\u2019s military powers, either alongside a physical war or to support a political stance, one security professional noted.\u201cEvery significant military power in the world has developed cyber capabilities [that] have evolved from espionage tools into full-fledged weapons to be used as part of a coordinated military response,\u201d observed Chris Clymer, director and CISO of Inversion6, in an email to Threatpost. \u201cTargeting another country with these arguably constitutes an act of war, but one less severe than kinetic attacks with missiles and tanks. This harassment will continue.\u201dCritical InfrastructureGovernmentHacks",

        "raw text": "The defunct REvil ransomware gang is claiming responsibility for a recent distributed denial of service (DDoS) campaign against a hospitality customer of cloud networking provider Akamai. However, it\u2019s highly possible the attack is not a resurgence of the infamous cybercriminal group but a copycat operations, researchers said.Akamai researchers have been monitoring the DDoS attack since May 12, when a customer an alerted the company\u2019s Security Incident Response Team (SIRT) of an attempted attack by a group claiming to be associated with REvil, Akamai revealed in a blog post Wednesday.\u201cThe attacks so far target a site by sending a wave of HTTP/2 GET requests with some cache-busting techniques to overwhelm the website,\u201d Akamai SIRT vulnerability researcher Larry Cashdollar wrote in the post. \u201cThe requests contain embedded demands for payment, a bitcoin (BTC) wallet, and business/political demands.\u201dHowever, while the attackers claim to be REvil, it\u2019s unclear at this time if the defunct ransomware group is responsible, as the attempts seem smaller than previous similar campaigns for which the group claimed responsibility, researchers said.There also appears to be a political motivation behind the DDoS campaign, which is inconsistent with REvil\u2019s previous tactics, in which the group claimed it was motivated solely by financial gain.Return of REvil?REvil, which went dark in July 2021, was a Russia-based ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group well-known for its high-profile attacks against Kaseya, JBS Foods and Apple Computer, among others. The disruptive nature of its attacks spurred international authorities to go hard against the group, with Europol arresting a number of the gang\u2019s affiliates in November 2021.Finally, in March 2022, Russia\u2014which until then had done little to thwart REvil\u2019s operation\u2013claimed responsibility for fully dismantling the group at the request of the U.S. government, apprehending its individual members. One of those arrested at the time was instrumental in helping ransomware group DarkSide in a crippling attack in May 2021 against Colonial Pipeline, which resulted in the company paying $5 million in ransom.The recent DDoS attack\u2014which would be a pivot for REvil\u2014was comprised of a simple HTTP GET request in which the request path contained a message to the target containing a 554-byte message demanding payment, researchers said. Traffic in the attack on Layer 7 of the network\u2014the human-computer interaction layer in which apps access network services\u2013peaked at 15 kRps.The victim was directed to send the BTC payment to a wallet address that \u201ccurrently has no history and is not tied to any previously known BTC,\u201d Cashdollar wrote.The attack also had an additional geospecific demand that requested the targeted company to cease business operations across an entire country, he said. Specifically, attackers threatened to launch to follow-up attack that would affect global business operations if this demand was not met and the ransom was not paid in a specific timeframe.Potential Copycat AttackThere is a precedent for REvil using DDoS in its pervious tactics as a means of triple extortion. However, aside from that, the attack does not appear to be the work of the ransomware group unless it\u2019s the start of an entirely new operation, Cashdollar noted.REvil\u2019s typical modus operandi was to gain access to a target network or organization and encrypt or steal sensitive data, demanding payment to decrypt or prevent information leakage to the highest bidders or threatening public disclosure of sensitive or damaging information, he said.The technique seen in the DDoS attack \u201cstrays from their normal tactics,\u201d Cashdollar wrote. \u201cThe REvil gang is a RaaS provider, and there is no presence of ransomware in this incident,\u201d he wrote.The political motivation tied to the attack\u2014which is linked to a legal ruling about the targeted company\u2019s business model\u2013also goes against a claim REvil\u2019s leaders have made in the past that they are purely profit-driven. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen REvil linked to political campaigns in any other previously reported attacks,\u201d Cashdollar observed.However, it is possible that REvil is seeking a resurgence by dipping its toe in a new business model of DDoS extortion, he said. What\u2019s more likely is that attackers in the campaign are merely using the name of a notorious cybercriminal group to frighten the targeted organization into meeting their demands, Cashdollar said.\u201cWhat better way to scare your victim into payment than leveraging the name of a notable group that strikes fear into the hearts of organizations\u2019 executives and security teams across wide swaths of industry,\u201d he wrote.HacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Attackers are using a newly released remote access trojan (RAT) to spread ransomware and distributed denial of service (DDoS) \u2014 in addition to the traditional RAT function of backdooring victims\u2019 systems.Researchers at Cyble Research Labs discovered the RAT, which they dubbed Borat RAT because it uses a photo of Sacha Baron Cohen, the comedian who created and portrayed the fictional character Borat in a popular series of mockumentary films.Borat RAT, however, is not \u201cverrry nice\u201d \u2014 contrary to one of the most popular catchphrases of the character for which it\u2019s named. It provides a range of advanced features as well as a dashboard for threat actors to perform various malicious activities beyond what other RATs can do, \u201cfurther expanding the malware capabilities,\u201d researchers said in a blog post about the malware.\u201cThe Borat RAT is a potent and unique combination of remote-access trojan, spyware and ransomware, making it a triple threat to any machine compromised by it,\u201d according to the post.Attack LaunchpadAs described by Cyble Research Labs, the RAT acts like a framework from which threat actors can launch their cybercriminal activities, providing a dashboard to perform typical RAT activities as well as an option to compile the malware binary for performing DDoS and ransomware attacks on the victim\u2019s machine.\u201cInterestingly, the RAT has an option to deliver a ransomware payload to the victim\u2019s machine for encrypting users\u2019 files as well as for demanding a ransom,\u201d researchers said. \u201cLike other ransomware, this RAT also has the capability to create a ransom note on the victim\u2019s machine.\u201dIndeed, the RAT could have been crafted to appeal to fledgling malware operators, as cybercriminals \u201coften don\u2019t know the best way to monetize their victims until they have been in an environment awhile,\u201d one security professional observed.\u201cMalware authors are increasingly developing feature sets and capabilities that allow flexibility on the part of the attacker,\u201d John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, a digital IT and security operations company, wrote in an email to Threatpost.The good news is, often these types of tools \u201ctend to be used by less sophisticated criminals\u2013or those pretending to be less sophisticated \u2014 who may find it difficult to succeed at ransomware at scale,\u201d he added.Specific Features and ModulesCyble researchers analyzed a number of modules of the Borat RAT and found that its functionality is varied. As mentioned, there is a ransomware module that can deliver a ransomware payload to the victim\u2019s machine for encrypting users\u2019 files and demand a ransom, as well as a module for performing a DDoS attack.The RAT also includes the following functionality in a series of individual modules:A keylogger that can monitor and store the keystrokes in the victim\u2019s machine;Audio recording that checks if a microphone is present and will record all audio and save it in a file named micaudio.wav;Webcam recording that records video is a webcam is present in the victim\u2019s machine;Remote desktop sessions that can allow threat actors the necessary rights to control the victim\u2019s machine, mouse, keyboard and screen capture;Code to enable reverse proxy for performing RAT activities anonymously;A module that collects information on a victim\u2019s machine, including OS name/ version, system model, etc;Process hollowing that injects malicious code into the legitimate processes;Credential stealing that can steal cookies, history, bookmarks, and saved login credentials from chromium-based browsers like Google Chrome and Edge; andA module that steals Discord tokens and sends the stolen token information to the attacker.Remote activities the RAT can perform to disturb victims include: play audio, swap mouse buttons, show/hide the desktop, show/hide the taskbar, and hold the mouse, among others.The Cyble Research Team said it will continue to monitor the RAT\u2019s actions and will update clients and the security community as the situation evolves.In the meantime, organizations can mitigate risk by performing some common security precautions, such as avoiding the storage of important files in common locations such as the Desktop and My Documents; using strong passwords and enforcing multi-factor authentication wherever possible; and turning on the automatic software update feature on all connected devices wherever possible and pragmatic, researchers advised.Individual users also should use a reputed antivirus and internet security software package on all connected devices, and should refrain from opening untrusted links and email attachments without verifying their authenticity, they said.Moving to the cloud?

Be careful \u2014 malware is making the rounds, disguised as a pro-Ukraine cyber-tool that will turn around and bite you instead, researchers are warning.In a Wednesday threat advisory, Cisco Talos described a campaign it\u2019s observed in which a threat actor was offering a supposed distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) tool on Telegram, that\u2019s purportedly meant to pummel Russian websites.In truth, the file is actually the Phoenix infostealer that\u2019s after credentials and cryptocurrency info, according to researchers.Phoenix is a keylogger that emerged in the summer of 2019 and which had, within months, turned into a full-fledged infostealer with powerful anti-detection and anti-analysis modules.Phoenix is a keylogger that emerged in the summer of 2019 and which had, within months, turned into a full-fledged infostealer with powerful anti-detection and anti-analysis modules.Researchers shared one such Telegram come-on, shown below:Infostealer disguised as a Russian attack tool on Telegram.

The crisis has brought both new threats and an influx of actors \u201cof varying skill,\u201d Cisco said.For example, the cyber-warzone has entailed the Conti ransomware gang\u2019s secrets getting spilled (including a decryptor and TrickBot code) by a Ukrainian security researcher (per KrebsOnSecurity, citing Alex Holden, the Ukrainian-born founder of the Milwaukee-based cyber intelligence firm Hold Security), a pro-Ukrainian member; furious phishing campaigns launched against Ukraine and those aiding Ukrainian refugees; the novel FoxBlade trojan;\u00a0DDoS attacks against Ukraine\u2019s military and economy; campaigns using multiple destructive wipers; hackers affiliating themselves with the Anonymous collective hijacking Russian cameras; and more.\u201cMany of these changes have been brought about by the rise in attacks being outsourced to sympathetic people on the internet, which brings about its own unique challenges and threats,\u201d Cisco outlined. The threat advisory referenced a tweet exhorting people to join an IT army to fight on the cyber-front.We are creating an IT army. We need digital talents. All operational tasks will be given here: https://t.co/Ie4ESfxoSn. There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists.\u2014 Mykhailo Fedorov (@FedorovMykhailo) February 26, 2022Soldiers on the frontlines get shot at, of course, and soldiers on the cyber-frontlines run the risk of getting arrested. After all, no matter how noble the hacking cause, it\u2019s still potentially illegal, Cisco pointed out.\u2018Legitimate\u2019 Disbalancer Liberator DDoS ToolThe malware in the Telegram message brands itself as a \u201cDisbalancer\u201d .ZIP file. There is, in fact, a group called \u201cdisBalancer\u201d that distributes a \u201clegitimate\u201d DDoS attack tool called, ironically enough, Liberator, Cisco found \u2013 a tool for waging cyberwar against \u201cRussian propaganda websites.\u201d\u201cA quick look at disBalancer\u2019s website shows that the actor uses similar language to the malicious message on Telegram\u2026and promises to target Russian sites with the stated goal of helping to \u2018liberate\u2019 Ukraine,\u201d according to Cisco\u2019s writeup.The security company offered a screenshot of the brandjacking Disbalancer Liberator website, shown below. As Cisco pointed out, there\u2019s a typo in the group\u2019s name, which is rendered as \u201cdisBalancher.\u201dScreenshot from Disbalancer Liberator website. Source: Cisco Talos.disBalancer\u2019s tool \u2013 Disbalancer.exe \u2013 is sincerely meant to DDoS Russia. The infostealer campaign, on the other hand, is based on a dropper disguised as that tool. It\u2019s protected with ASProtect, Cisco said, a known packer for Windows executables.\u201cIf a researcher tries to debug the malware execution, it will be confronted with a general error. The malware, after performing the anti-debug checks, will launch Regsvcs.exe, which is included along with the .NET framework,\u201d according to the writeup. \u201cIn this case, the regsvcs.exe is not used as a living off the land binary (LoLBin). It is injected with the malicious code, which consists of the Phoenix information stealer.\u201dThe actors behind this campaign aren\u2019t the newbies flocking to the front lines. Rather, evidence shows that they\u2019ve been distributing infostealers since at least November, Cisco said, as evidenced by the fact that the infostealer exfiltrates stolen info to a remote IP address \u2013 in this case, a Russian IP \u2014 95[.]142.46.35 \u2014 on port 6666.That IP/port pair \u201chas been distributing infostealers since at least November 2021,\u201d researchers said. The longevity of the pairing enforces researchers\u2019 belief that these are experienced actors at work, taking advantage of the Ukraine calamity, rather than threat actors new to the scene.The infostealer is hoovering up a broad array of information, Cisco said. \u201cThe .ZIP file provided in the Telegram channel contains an executable, which is the infostealer,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe infostealer gathers information from a variety of sources, including web browsers like Firefox and Chrome and other locations on the filesystem for key pieces of information.\u201dThe researchers provided a deobfuscated screen capture, replicated below, showing how the pilfered info is sent with a simple base64 encoding. The screen grab\u00a0 shows the breadth of information being pulled off of infected systems, including a large number of crypto wallets and information on MetaMask. \u201cA .ZIP file of the stolen data is also uploaded to the server, completing the compromise,\u201d Cisco said.Sample data exfiltrated to server. Source: Cisco Talos.Don\u2019t Eat That: You Don\u2019t Know Where It\u2019s BeenThe infostealer masquerading as a DDoS tool to attack Russian targets is just one example of the many ways cybercriminals are milking the invasion for social-engineering sustenance, exploiting sympathizers on both sides. \u201cSuch activity could take the form of themed email lures on news topics or donation solicitations, malicious links purporting to host relief funds or refugee support sites, malware masquerading as security defensive or offensive tools, and more,\u201d researchers suggested.In this case, cybercriminals were distributing an infostealer in an apparently profit-motivated campaign. It could have been worse, though, according to the report: \u201cIt could have just as easily been a more sophisticated state-sponsored actor or privateer group doing work on behalf of a nation-state.\u201dExpect this type of situational exploitation to continue and to diversify, Cisco predicted: \u201cThe global interest in the conflict creates a massive potential victim pool for threat actors and also contributes to a growing number of people interested in carrying out their own offensive cyber operations.\u201dCisco reminded users to essentially avoid eating food that\u2019s been dropped on the floor. You don\u2019t know where that stuff\u2019s been, researchers warned, so be wary of installing software \u201cwhose origins are unknown, especially software that is being dropped into random chat rooms on the internet.\u201dAs always, carefully inspect suspicious emails before opening attachments, Cisco advised, and validate software or other files before downloading.031122 0934 UPDATE: Corrected identification of Conti leaker.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "On Tuesday, institutions central to Ukraine\u2019s military and economy were hit with a wave of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which sparked an avalanche of headlines around the world. The strike itself had limited impact \u2014 but the larger implications for critical infrastructure beyond the Ukraine are worth noting, researchers said.The targets were core entities to Ukraine: the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ministry of Defense, Oschadbank (the State Savings Bank) and Privatbank, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank, servicing nearly 20 million customers. Oschadbank and Privatbank are considered \u201csystemically important\u201d to Ukraine\u2019s financial markets.Click to Register for FREEAdam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at CrowdStrike, said via email that the attacks consisted of \u201ca large volume of traffic, three orders of magnitude more than regularly observed traffic, with 99 percent of this traffic consisting of HTTPs requests.\u201dWhat Happened?By overloading targeted servers, this kind of DoS attack ensured that end users couldn\u2019t access their websites, bank accounts and so on for a period of time. As Ukraine\u2019s Center for Strategic Communications noted in a Facebook post, some Privatbank customers found themselves \u201ccompletely unable to access\u201d the company\u2019s app, while others\u2019 accounts \u201cdo not reflect balance and recent transactions.\u201dSome customers received SMS messages claiming that ATMs were out of order, according to Ukraine\u2019s Cyberpolice, which\u00a0tweeted the claim. Those reports however were debunked, according to NPR.Crucially, the attackers disrupted the availability of these websites and services, but not the integrity of any data. Thus, the transactions, balances and private information associated with bank accounts and military databases appear to be untainted, according to reports.And, according\u00a0to Ukraine\u2019s State Special Communications Service, a \u201cworking group of experts\u201d convened yesterday to take \u201call necessary measures to localize and resist the cyberattack.\u201d All affected banking services had resumed by 7:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, and the websites for the Armed Forces and Ministry of Defense have since been restored.\u201cThe DDoS attacks against the Ukrainian defense ministry and financial institutions appear to be harassment similar to the previous DDoS attacks seen in January,\u201d Rick Holland, CISO at Digital Shadows, said via email. \u201cThey could be a precursor to a significant attack or a component of a broader campaign to intimidate and confuse Ukraine.\u201dPart of a Much Broader CampaignWhile limited in impact, these events have come mere hours after the Security Service of Ukraine\u2019s (SSU) reported a \u201cmassive wave of hybrid warfare\u201d \u2013 120 cyberattacks against government authorities, and a fake news botnet of more than 18,000 social-media accounts \u2013 all designed to \u201csystemically sow panic, spread fake information and distort the real state of affairs\u201d in the country.The SSU attributed this wave of hostile activity to a single unnamed but obvious \u201caggressor state.\u201dLikewise, Tuesday\u2019s attacks have not been officially attributed. Still, their timing, as Russia mobilizes more than 100,000 troops at Ukraine\u2019s northeast border, is inspiring speculation.\u201cIt would be no surprise,\u201d wrote Mike McLellan, director of intelligence at SecureWorks, via email, \u201cif it transpires that they are the result of cyberattacks conducted by Russia, or by threat actors with a pro-Russian agenda.\u201dHe added, \u201cRussia has a history of cyberattacks \u201cdesigned to distract the Ukrainian government and critical infrastructure operators and undermine the trust among the Ukrainian population.\u201dAnd indeed, in the past two months, Russian- advanced persistent threats (APTs) have been tied to an attack\u00a0on 70 Ukrainian government websites, a\u00a0wiper\u00a0targeting government, non-profit and IT organizations, and increased\u00a0attacks and espionage\u00a0against military targets.It\u2019s also worth noting that the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea coincided with an outbreak of the Turla virus, and targeted espionage attacks against government agencies, politicians and businesses.Others however noted that there could be many beneficiaries to the fog of potential war.\u201cWhat could be a more likely scenario [than Russia carrying out the attacks] is that other countries like China and Iran take advantage of the chaos and fog of war to further their interests and conduct their campaigns against the West,\u201d Holland noted. \u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018never let a good crisis go to waste.\u2019\u00a0 The risk of these types of false-flag operations could have unintended consequences, and you can\u2019t close Pandora\u2019s Box once it\u2019s opened.\u201dTim Wade, technical director and deputy CTO at Vectra, cautioned against hasty attribution.\u201cThere are no shortage of actors that could stand to benefit from chaos or disruption \u2013 ranging from criminal actors to nation states \u2013 and that, unlike Hollywood movies, real motivations can be tricky to unwind,\u201d he said via email.Could Ukraine\u2019s Problems Migrate West?Besides the direct threat to Ukrainians, increasing cyber-disruption in the region could spill over to affect American and European countries and businesses.Prior attacks against Ukrainian targets have crippled companies that simply do business or passively interact with Ukrainian organizations. Famously, the 2017 NotPetya malware that breached a Kiev-based accounting software vendor ended up causing billions of dollars of damage to multinational corporations like Maersk, Merck and FedEx.Government officials have been warning of the potential for similar attacks directed at the United States government and its critical industries. A January bulletin from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concluded that \u201cRussia would consider initiating a cyberattack against the Homeland if it perceived a U.S. or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security.\u201dThe DHS and FBI this week also warned of an uptick in Russian scanning of domestic law-enforcement networks and other American targets.Security researchers noted that it\u2019s important to be wary as the geo-political tensions continue \u2014 given that the chaos that would arise from a full-blown Russian incursion would provide plenty of cover for cyberattackers of all stripes.As Crowdstrike\u2019s Meyers said, \u201cwhile there is no evidence of any targeting of western entities at this time, there is certainly potential for collateral impact as a result of disruptive or destructive attacks targeting Ukraine \u2013 this could impact companies that have a presence in Ukraine, those that do business with Ukrainian companies, or have a supply chain component in Ukraine such as code development/offshoring.\u201dWould the U.S. be ready in such a scenario? Last week, DHS officials told American cities that they were extra-vulnerable to wipers that could result in polluting a water supply or crashing a power grid. And it\u2019s worth noting that, according to data from Cyber Seek, 600,000 cybersecurity roles across the nation are currently vacant, meaning that many organizations are understaffed for incident response.\u201cAre these attacks part of nation-state aggression? Or criminal opportunists exploiting a tense situation? Or just entirely coincidental? While answering with any certainty may be tough, what isn\u2019t difficult is drawing clear line of sight to the significance of cyber-resilience as it relates to critical services and infrastructure,\u201d Vectra\u2019s Wade noted. \u201cToday, everyone operating something of value has a target on their back and we\u2019d all do well to prepare for the inevitability of the consequences of that fact.\u201dCritical InfrastructureGovernmentHacksMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Pankaj Gupta, Senior Director at CitrixDistributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, bigger, and economically motivated. Even after 25 years, they still pose a huge security risk for every business. This is in large part because DDoS attacks are relatively easy and cheap to launch. A case in point: Bad actors launched the largest DDoS attack of all time in September 2021, demonstrating the continued viability of DDoS attacks for unscrupulous parties who have something to gain from them.DDoS attacks are at the forefront of the war on digital businesses, and no company or industry is safe. DDoS attacks aim to overload (or exhaust) a business\u2019s digital resources and prevent them from performing normally. At worst, the massive influx of traffic will cause web servers to crash. DDoS attacks can also be a smokescreen for data breaches, attempting to draw IT\u2019s attention to the DDoS attacks rather than the data breach. Ransom DDoS attacks \u2014 where bad actors demand payment to prevent or cease a DDoS attack \u2014 are also on the rise.So how can DDoS attacks be mitigated? They key is to block as much bad traffic as possible while keeping the application or service running optimally. And there are four key considerations each business must assess to select the right DDoS protection solution.1. Comprehensive Protection Against DDoS AttacksDDoS attacks come in many forms, but the primary types are connection-protocol attacks, volumetric attacks and application-layer attacks:Connection-protocol attacks aim to fill connection tables of edge devices like routers, firewalls, and load balancers\u2014 which will take down the network. Common examples of connection-protocol attacks include SYN floods and UDP floods.Volumetric attacks attempt to attack the network directly and fill the pipe to prevent legitimate requests from getting through. Common examples of volumetric attacks include ICMP floods, IP/ICMP fragmentation, and IPSec floods.Application-layer attacks are the most disruptive type of DDoS attack because they target an aspect of your application or service that can affect your customers or workforce. Additionally, they may have low traffic throughput rates that make them difficult to detect. Application-layer attacks such as HTTP GET floods and DNS amplification have been growing in popularity over the past few years.A truly effective DDoS protection solution must be comprehensive enough to mitigate all these attack vectors.2. Scalable to Mitigate the Biggest DDoS AttacksA key question to ask is \u201cHow scalable does my DDoS protection solution need to be?\u201d The answer is \u201cvery\u201d because the scope of DDoS attacks is increasing every day.Another question to ask is: \u201cShould I use cloud-based DDoS protection or defend my systems with an on-prem solution?\u201d On-prem devices have a limited ability to scale on demand, so you must prepare for the lead times associated with increasing your capacity. Moreover, on-prem DDoS protection solutions can be complex to install and maintain, so a dedicated IT team would be necessary.Cloud-delivered solutions provide a simple service with nothing to install or maintain and they can auto-scale with the size of a DDoS attack. They offer centralized mitigation to provide consistent protection across all applications and sites. The global presence of an established mitigation service can offer high-throughput scrubbing capacity, protecting you from massive DDoS attacks. When it comes to DDoS defense, cloud-based solutions have much to offer.3. Always-On vs. On-Demand DDoS Protection: Find the Right Balance of Investment and ProtectionDo you prefer to have all online traffic always redirected, or do you prefer to redirect traffic for scrubbing only during an attack? Always-on DDoS detection provides constant protection, but it will also add a small amount of latency to normal operations.On the other hand, on-demand DDoS protection will reduce application latency day to day, but you will have increased exposure to a DDoS attack when it begins and before you start to redirect traffic. Always-on solutions are more expensive than on-demand solutions, so it\u2019s a question of balancing protection vs. cost to meet your business requirements.4. Integrated vs. Stand-alone DDoS Protection: Choose Between Simplicity or ComplexityThe stand-alone approach to DDoS protection will only protect against DDoS attacks. You will require additional application protection services that must be deployed and managed individually, and that can add significant complexity. With an integrated solution, DDoS protection comes with web application firewalls, bot management, and API protection, offering both comprehensive protection and simplicity. You only need to manage a single solution rather than multiple products from multiple vendors.It\u2019s Time to Re-Evaluate Your DDoS Protection SolutionCitrix offers a comprehensive, cloud-delivered DDoS protection solution with always-on and on-demand options. It has one of the largest scrubbing capacities to protect against large-scale DDoS attacks. The Citrix DDoS protection solution is available as a stand-alone service and also as an integrated solution that includes a web application firewall and bot management and API protection.With a 25-year track record, it\u2019s clear that DDoS attacks are here to stay. And they will only become much larger and more pervasive with the advent of 5G and the proliferation of poorly secured IoT devices.So ask yourself now: Do I have the right DDoS protection to thwart them and keep my business safe?Cloud SecurityNewsSponsoredWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A critical security bug in the Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway could allow cyberattackers to crash entire corporate networks without needing to authenticate.The two affected Citrix products (formerly the NetScaler ADC and Gateway) are used for application-aware traffic management and secure remote access, respectively. The federated working specialist pushed out a security patch on Tuesday for the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2021-22955, which allows unauthenticated denial of service (DoS), due to uncontrolled resource consumption, according to the advisory.Citrix also addressed a lower-severity bug that is likewise due to uncontrolled resource consumption. It impacts both previous products, as well as the Citrix SD-WAN WANOP Edition appliance. The latter provides optimization for Citrix SD-WAN deployments, which enable secure connectivity and seamless access to virtual, cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) apps across enterprise and branch locations.Register now for our LIVE event!Tracked as CVE-2021-22956, the second flaw allows temporary disruption of: a device\u2019s management GUI; the Nitro API for configuring and monitoring NetScaler appliances programmatically; and remote procedure call (RPC) communication, which is what essentially enables distributed computing in Citrix settings.In terms of the impact of exploitation, all three products are widely deployed globally, with Gateway and ADC alone installed in at least 80,000 companies in 158 countries as of early 2020, according to an assessment from Positive Technologies at the time.Disruption to any of the appliances could prevent remote and branch access to corporate resources and general blocking of cloud and virtual assets and apps.All of this makes them an attractive target for cybercriminals, and indeed, the Citrix ADC and Gateway in particular are no spring chickens when it comes to the critical vulnerability scene.In the summer of 2020, multiple vulnerabilities were discovered that would allow code injection, information disclosure and denial of service, with many exploitable by an unauthenticated, remote attacker. And, in December of 2019, a critical RCE bug was disclosed as a zero-day that took the vendor weeks to patch.Few Technical Details, Many Affected Products While Citrix didn\u2019t release technical details on the latest bugs, VulnDB noted on Wednesday that for CVE-2021-22955, \u201cthe exploitability is told to be difficult. The attack can only be initiated within the local network. The exploitation doesn\u2019t require any form of authentication.\u201d It assigned a severity score of 5.1 out of 10 to the bug, despite Citrix\u2019 internal rating of \u201ccritical.\u201dThe site also reported that exploits are calculated to be worth up to $5,000, and noted that \u201cmanipulation with an unknown input leads to a denial of service vulnerability\u2026This is going to have an impact on availability.\u201dThe vendor said the vulnerabilities affect the following supported versions:Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2021-22955 and CVE-2021-22956):Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 13.0 before 13.0-83.27Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway 12.1 before 12.1-63.22Citrix ADC and NetScaler Gateway 11.1 before 11.1-65.23Citrix ADC 12.1-FIPS before 12.1-55.257Citrix SD-WAN WANOP Edition (CVE-2021-22956):Models 4000-WO, 4100-WO, 5000-WO and 5100-WOVersion 11.4 before 11.4.2Version 10.2 before 10.2.9cThe WANOP feature of SD-WAN Premium Edition is not impacted. In the case of the first Citrix ADC and Gateway bug, appliances must be configured as a VPN or AAA virtual server in order to be vulnerable.In the case of the second bug, appliances must have access to NSIP or SNIP with management interface access.Customers using Citrix-managed cloud services are unaffected.Want to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

        "raw text": "The third quarter saw the sheer volume of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks surge to several thousand hits per day, signaling a re-distribution of tactics by malicious actors away from cryptomining and toward the use of DDoS as a tool of intimidation, disinformation and straight-up extortion.The latest DDoS report for Q3 from Kaspersky details a record-breaking frenzy of recent activity by threat actors.\u201cJuly started off relatively quietly, but towards the middle of the month the average daily count of DDoS attacks exceeded 1,000, with a whopping 8,825 attacks on August 18,\u201d the report said. \u201cFor two more days, August 21 and 22, the daily count of five thousand was exceeded and over three thousand attacks were detected on August 2 and 6, September 16, 18, 19 and 22.\u201dAnd while the volume of DDoS attacks spiked, their duration declined, the researchers found.\u201cThis may be due to the decreasing number of attacks lasting 50 hours or more and a rise in relatively short attacks,\u201d the report added.Middleboxes and Unavailable Ports The third quarter also ushered in two new DDoS attack vectors, the analysts found.During Q3, a team from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado at Boulder figured out how to exploit TCP protocol to attack security devices like firewalls, deep packet inspection (DPI) tools and network address translators (NAT); often called \u201cmiddleboxes\u201d because of their position between the client and server.\u201cIf a request for access to a banned resource is sent under the guise of the victim, the response from a middlebox can be significantly larger,\u201d the Kaspersky report said. \u201cAs such, the researchers found more than 386,000 devices giving an amplification factor of over 100, with more than 97,000 of them over 500, and 192 of them over 51,000.\u201dAnother new attack first identified by Nexusguard named Black Storm bombards communications service provider (CSP) networks with requests to access to closed ports.\u201cProcessing these messages consumes a lot of resources, which overloads victim devices and prevents them from accepting legitimate requests,\u201d the Kaspersky report said. \u201cThe researchers note that this method allows an attacker to take down not only individual servers, but the provider\u2019s entire network, including a large one.\u201dM\u0113ris BotnetFirst found by Yandex and Qrator Labs, M\u0113ris is able to send an enormous number of requests per second, and claimed victims including cybersecurity media sites Krebs on Security and Infosecurity, plus New Zealand banks, post mail service and the country\u2019s MetService weather service.Other notable DDoS events during the quarter included attacks on VoIP providers in Britain, Canada, and the U.S; a ransomware attack on Bitcoin.org; the targeting of Russian newspaper Vedomosti; the shutdown of gaming servers in Europe for Final Fantasy XIVl; and many more.More than 40 percent of DDoS attacks during the third quarter targeted operations in the U.S., followed by Hong Kong (15 percent) and China (7.74 percent), the report found.Stefano De Blasi told Threatpost that researchers from Digital Shadows have seen an uptick in threat actors combining DDoS attacks with extortion demands over the past two years, which could be a sign of more to come, De Blasi said.\u201cDifferent motivations can lie behind a DDoS attack,\u201d De Blasi told Threatpost. \u201cCybercriminals typically conduct DDoS operations to temporarily disrupt a target\u2019s infrastructure or act as a decoy for more dangerous activity, but companies affected by high-intensity DDoS attacks may experience a long-time interruption of business, which in turn may cause financial loss, brand or reputational damage, and influence customer trust.\u201dDDoS vs. Cryptomining Computing Power AllocationThe Kaspersky team explained in the report that the ecosystem of botnet computing power is pulled between cryptocurrency mining and powering DDoS botnets. Counterintuitively, this quarter saw growth in DDoS attacks even while cryptocurrency prices are still high.\u201cNow, judging by the growing DDoS market against the backdrop of consistently high cryptocurrency prices, attackers have started to allocate their resources differently,\u201d the report said. \u201cAnd this is quite logical: DDoS services are in demand, and the prolonged supply shortage has likely led to an increase in prices in this market, making it profitable for botnet operators to resume attacks. As such, the DDoS market seems to be returning to the growth rate we saw in late 2019.\u201dWith predictions indicating more DDoS attacks on the way, it\u2019s up to organizations to mount a defense and protecting internet of things (IoT) devices connected to public networks from being hijacked and turned into botnets, Ben Pick, a consultant and nVisum told Threatpost.\u201cOrganizations can protect themselves by applying intermediate tooling at network boundaries, Pick said. \u201cMost cloud services include security tools to mitigate or outright prevent DDoS attacks. Utilizing a specific tool is a better protection apparatus than spinning up resources to accommodate the additional network bandwidth, as that can cause massive impacts to the overall infrastructure costs.\u201dCybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging. OSquery and CloudQuery is a solid answer.

        "raw text": "Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) started out as an inconvenience: They were a roadblock that kept customers from getting at systems.That\u2019s bad enough. Keeping availability away from customers via DDoS can have a painful impact on businesses as they find their doors blocked to customers, keeping them from making transactions.But over the years, DDoS attacks have evolved regarding level of sophistication, metrics and the techniques that threat actors employ.According to Peter Klimek, director of technology in the office of the CTO at Imperva, DDoS attacks have blossomed into what he calls a huge business for cybercriminals. \u201cLooking at it from a business perspective, that\u2019s really the big impact and are why businesses should start considering DDoSes as \u201ca consistent and persistent threat.\u201d\u201cAs a whole, there\u2019s really a low barrier to entry in order to actually perform the [DDoS] attack itself,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a high capacity for damage or a high potential for it leading to damage.\u201dTake the services known as booters, aka stressors: \u201cThey can be had and used for as little as the price of a cup of coffee,\u201d Klimek observed, and \u201cEven a small scale DDoS attack can cause disruption.\u201dBecause of the low technical acumen that\u2019s required to launch lower-scale attacks, a poorly defended network can be taken down \u201cfor as little as a hundred dollars.\u201dKlimek visited the Threatpost podcast recently to discuss the evolution of DDoSes and other trends that he and his team have unearthed.Listen to the full podcast below, or download it directly here.It\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

        "raw text": "Researchers are warning internet censorship systems are ripe for abuse by a new type of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. The potential for abuse is concerning, researchers say, because attacks would take advantage of a type of reflection and amplification, which would be \u201cextremely detrimental to any network\u201d if carried out.Netscout, which detailed the attack vector, dubbed the type of DDoS attack a Middlebox HTTP Reflection/Amplification (MBHTTP) misconfiguration vulnerability. They say attacks can produce DDoS volumes as high as a 700,000 to 1 amplification factor.The type of attack is a HTTP Reflection/Amplification, meaning an attacker can both magnify the amount of malicious traffic they generate while obscuring the sources of the attack traffic. An HTTP-based DDoS attack sends junk HTTP requests to a target\u2019s server tying up resources and locking out users from using a particular site or service.\nAlong with the risk of systems leveraged in massive DDoS attacks the censorship systems themselves would also be crippled, with traffic analysis tools knocked offline and permitted traffic blocked, according to researchers.Tens of Millions of Devices ExposedNetscout credits a joint team of researchers from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder for identifying the widespread configuration vulnerability. Netscout estimates that 200 million IP addresses can potentially be abused to launch attacks of this kind.\u201cTens of millions of these devices are exposed and vulnerable to abuse from adversaries and approximately 18 million of these provide at least a 2:1 amplification factor, resulting in one of the most prolific types of reflectors/amplifiers available to adversaries,\u201d wrote Roland Dobbins and Steinthor Bjarnason in a technical analysis posted Friday.Why Censorship Systems?Affected censorship systems, researchers found, are particularly susceptible to these type attacks because of three factors write researchers:A desire on the part of the designers of such systems to scale their performance and function in asymmetrical-routing scenarios by unwisely foregoing the requirement for a full TCP handshake prior to responding to requests for a URI on the censorship systems\u2019 deny-lists.The configuration and deployment of abusable systems such that they will intercept and respond to inbound spoofed, crafted attack initiator packets on their northbound interfaces, rather than intercepting and processing outbound traffic solely on their southbound interfaces.The siting of some abusable systems within the ambit of routing loops, thus converting them into what are effectively infinite repeating reflectors/amplifiers.Netscout says many censorship systems are \u201csuboptimal\u201d in design and \u201cimplementation decisions allow spoofed requests for denied FQDNs and/or URIs to be synthesized by attackers in much the same way as other well-known reflection/amplification DDoS vectors.\u201d This, they say results in amplified HTTP responses being directed towards the intended targets of the attack.Systems Open to Attack Because of Misconfiguration At the heart of the vulnerability is a common misconfiguration of censorship systems that responds to HTML block notification pages from Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) in a specific way.\u201c[A] lack of enforcement regarding TCP three-way handshakes, ensure that attackers can spoof the IP addresses of their targets, selecting both the source and destination ports of their choice, in order to launch high-pps/-bps HTTP reflection/amplification attacks,\u201d researchers wrote.Attackers can easily cloak attacks as well.\u201cSkilled attackers are likely to choose source and destination ports intended to allow the amplified attack traffic to conform to common network access control policies, thus masquerading the attack traffic so that at first glance, it appears to be legitimate in the context of targeted applications, services, and infrastructure,\u201d wrote Dobbins and Bjarnason.Mitigation Risk: The Recommendations Netscout recommends that network operators identify abuse-able censorship systems and remove them.\u201cThe security researchers who discovered this attack methodology have published a bespoke fork of the ZMap scanning software, along with an accompanying module, which can be used to identify abusable systems,\u201d researchers wrote.\u201cNationwide internet censorship threatens free and open access to communication and information for millions of users living inside of censoring regimes\u2026 We show that this poses an even greater threat to the internet than previously understood,\u201d wrote researchers from the University of Maryland and the University of Colorado Boulder.GovernmentVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "UPDATEMajor financial institutions, airlines and the Hong Kong stock exchange were knocked offline by a backfiring distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) mitigation service Thursday. The hour-long outage, which was triggered at approximately 1 a.m. EST Thursday, is tied to Akamai Technology\u2019s anti-DDoS Prolexic service.In a statement to Threatpost at 7:44 a.m. EST, Akamai confirm a segment of its Prolexic platform was impacted and is now back up and running. \u201cWe are continuing to validate services. We will share more details of what transpired, but our first priority is ensuring all customer impact is mitigated,\u201d wrote Chris Nicholson, senior public relations manager, Akamai.\nAccording to reports, airline systems used by Delta, American, Southwest and United suffered outages at around 1 a.m. EST. Also impacted were financial institutions including Discover and Navy Federal Credit Union, according to a report by National Public Radio.Australian based ITNews reported that services believed to rely on Akamai\u2019s Prolexic were knocked temporarily offline.\u201cUsers reported widespread problems accessing a range of internet properties and online services from the likes of CBA, Westpac, ANZ, UBank, AMP Bank, Macquarie Bank, ME Bank and more,\u201d according to ITNews reporter Ry Crozier.Mid-day operations of Hong Kong\u2019s stock exchange were also impacted by the technical problems.Virgin Australia also published a statement to its customers attributing an outage it suffered to Akamai\u2019s Prolexic service.\u201cVirgin Australia was one of many organizations to experience an outage with the Akamai content delivery system today and we are working with them to ensure that necessary measures are taken to prevent these outages from reoccurring,\u201d the airline said in a statement.Akamai is aware of the issue and actively working to restore services as soon as possible.\u2014 Akamai Technologies (@Akamai) June 17, 2021Akamai updated customers on the network incident at 12:21 p.m. EST stating:\u00a0\u201cAkamai experienced an outage for one of its Prolexic DDoS services (Routed 3.0) starting at 4:20 AM UTC. We detected the issue immediately and impacted customers received an error alert within seconds. The impact was limited to Akamai customers using version 3.0 of the Routed service.Many of the approximately 500 customers using this service were automatically rerouted, which restored operations within a few minutes. The large majority of the remaining customers manually rerouted shortly thereafter.The issue was not caused by a system update or a cyberattack. A routing table value used by this particular service was inadvertently exceeded. The effect was an unanticipated disruption of service.\u00a0We restored the service by 8:47 AM UTC and customers began the process of routing back on to the service at that time.\u00a0We recognize the impact of this issue and we extend our apologies to our customers and any of their end users who were affected.We have taken steps to prevent a recurrence of this issue. We will also be working to make sure that every Akamai customer is set up for automatic rerouting in the future.\u201dAdvice by Akamai posted to social media advised, \u201cIf you face the downtime, kindly turn off/route off Prolexic solution.\u201d Early, in a tweet posted at 6:24 a.m. EST on Thursday, Akamai stated; \u201cAkamai is aware of the issue and actively working to restore services as soon as possible.\u201dAccording to Akamai\u2019s description, Prolexic is a DDoS mitigation service that can fend off \u201cterabit-scale attacks\u201d.(This article was updated 6/17 at 2:26 p.m. EST with the updated statement from Akamai)\u00a0Join Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET\u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) extortion group has blazed back on the cybercrime scene, this time under the name of \u201cFancy Lazarus.\u201d It\u2019s been launching a series of new attacks that may or may not have any teeth, researchers said.The new name is a tongue-in-cheek combination of the Russia-linked Fancy Bear advanced persistent threat (APT) and North Korea\u2019s Lazarus Group. The choice seems natural, given that the gang was last seen \u2013 including in a major campaign in October \u2013 purporting to be various APTs, including Armada Collective,  Fancy Bear and Lazarus Group.According to Proofpoint, this time around the gang has been sending threatening, targeted emails to various organizations, including those operating in the energy, financial, insurance, manufacturing, public utilities and retail sectors \u2013 asking for a two-Bitcoin (BTC) starting ransom (around $75,000) if companies want to avoid a crippling DDoS attack. The price doubles to four BTC after the deadline, and increases by one BTC each day after that. The targets are mostly located in the U.S.While it\u2019s hard to make a definitive correlation, the timing of some of the Fancy Lazarus campaigns correspond with high-profile ransomware attacks over the past six months, in terms of targeting the same vertical industries, according to Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection at Proofpoint.\u201cThese include utility, natural gas and manufacturing,\u201d she told Threatpost. \u201cThis could be an attempt to ride the coattails of high-profile news stories and result in a higher likelihood of payment. Another trend we have seen over the past four months are a focus on sending these threats to financial institutions and large insurance providers.\u201dEmail Campaign DetailsThe emails announce that the organization is being targeted by Fancy Lazarus, and they threaten a DDoS attack in seven days if the target doesn\u2019t pay up, according to an analysis on Thursday from Proofpoint. The messages also warn of potential damage to reputation and loss of internet access at offices, and then promise that a \u201csmall attack\u201d will be launched on a specific IP, subnet or Autonomous System with an attack of 2Tbps, as a preview of things to come.The emails are either in plain text, HTML-based or present the letter in an embedded .JPG image \u2013 likely a detection-evasion technique, Proofpoint noted.\u201cThe emails are typically sent to well researched recipients, such as individuals listed as contacts in Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) or Whois information for company networks,\u201d according to Proofpoint\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe emailed individuals also work in areas such as communications, external relations, investor relations. Additionally, extortion emails are often sent to email aliases such as help desk, abuse, administrative contacts or customer service.\u201dMeanwhile, the sender email is unique to each target. They use a random \u201cfirst name, last name\u201d convention for the ender, using fake names.The ransom note. Source: Proofpoint.Some of this is a change in tactics from previous campaigns by the group. For instance, Proofpoint noted that the starting ransom was 10 or 20 BTC in 2020 campaigns \u2013 a change that was made likely to account for exchange-rate fluctuations. In October for instance, a 20-BTC demand translated to $230,000.Also, previously the sender names on the emails often contained the name of an APT that was in the headlines, such as Fancy Bear; or, they included the targeted company\u2019s CEO name.Sometimes a Hoax?It\u2019s unknown whether the group always follows through on its threat to launch massive DDoS attacks. An FBI alert on the group from last August said that while the group had taken aim at thousands of organizations from multiple global industry verticals by that point, many of them saw no further activity after the deadline expired \u2013 or, they were able to easily mitigate it.In some cases though, such as was the case with Travelex, \u201cthe threat actor conducted a volumetric attack on a custom port of four IP addresses serving the company\u2019s subdomains, according to Intel471 researchers writing last year. Two days later, the attackers carried out another DNS amplification attack against Travelex using Google DNS servers, the firm reported.\u201cWhile FBI reporting indicates they do not always follow through on their threat of a DDoS, there have been several prominent institutions that have reported an impact to their operations and other impacted companies have just been successful at mitigating the attacks,\u201d DeGrippo said. \u201cThis type of behavior keeps them more closely aligned with that of a cybercriminal versus a scam artist.\u201dIn any case, it\u2019s important for companies and organizations to be prepared by having appropriate mitigations in place such as using a DDoS protection service and having disaster recovery plans at the ready, she added.Ransom DDoS: A Growing TacticRansom DDoS is not a recent development, but it has become more popular of late, according to DeGrippo, thanks to the mainstreaming of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\u201cWhile RDDoS existed earlier this type of extortion likely did not catch on until, in part, the adoption of cryptocurrency, which allowed the threat actors a safer means to receive payment,\u201d she told Threatpost. \u201cThese kinds of campaigns have been done in an organized fashion for the past year.\u201dShe added that Fancy Lazarus\u2019 choice to align its ransom demand with the fluctuating price of cryptocurrency is notable.\u201cAs Bitcoin prices fluctuate, we see some change in their demand amounts, proving that cryptocurrency markets and malicious actor activity are absolutely correlated,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has been the case since at least 2016 in the early days of large-scale ransomware. Threat actors send their campaigns when the prices are most advantageous, attempting to make more money when the various currencies are at a high valuation. Other actors use other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, but Bitcoin continues to be the massively popular coin of choice for malicious threat actors.\u201dWhile it\u2019s impossible to know the success rate of the Fancy Lazarus campaigns, \u201cgiven the potentially substantial financial payoff for relatively little work on the threat actor\u2019s part, a low success rate would still make this a worthwhile tactic,\u201d DeGrippo noted.One trend to watch is the addition of ransomware to the mix going forward. In February, the REvil ransomware gang started adding DDoS attacks to its efforts, in an effort to ratchet up the pressure to pay.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "Belgian ISP Belnet has restored its service after a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack earlier this week that cut off Internet access to numerous government, public, scientific and educational agencies, including Belgium\u2019s Parliament and some law-enforcement agencies.Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.The attack occurred Tuesday at 11 a.m. (GMT) in Europe and affected \u201call the institutions connected to the Belnet network,\u201d which number about 200, according to a statement published Wednesday on Belnet\u2019s website.Moreover, upon investigation, it seems the attack\u2013a coordinated effort targeting the Belgium government\u2013also affected other ISPs in what was the largest DDoS attack the country has seen, according to reports. Belgium is the headquarters of the European Union (EU) and thus a key hub of activity and decision-making that affects the global political and socio-economic landscape.While Belnet restored service to its own network and website by Tuesday evening, the attack continues to have ongoing consequences, with some customers still unable to connect to websites and online services, according to Belnet.\u201cWe are fully aware of the impact on the organizations connected to our network and their users and we are aware that this has profoundly disrupted their functioning,\u201d Dirk Haex, technical director at Belnet, said in the statement.However, the attack was \u201cof such a scale that our entire network was saturated,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that the perpetrators of the attack constantly changed tactics made it even more difficult to neutralize it,\u201d Haex said.No Sign of Intrusion At this point there is no indication that cybercriminals have infiltrated the network of any of the institutions or organizations affected, as it appears the attack was aimed solely at saturating networks to disrupt traffic, he added.Indeed, Belnet told news outlet VRT, which also was disrupted due to the attack, that it was the first time the service provider had been confronted with such a \u201cgigantic data flow.\u201dThe massive scale of the attack indicates that threat actors did not have Belnet in their crosshairs, but aimed to take down the network of the Belgian government, Geert Baudewijns, CEO of security company Secutec, told VRT. Secutec providers security services for the Belgian government.\u201cThis was done via all telecom providers,\u201d he said in the VRT report. \u201cProviders such as Telenet and Proximus have also received this attack.\u201dTraffic flow that flooded networks in the attack came from some 29 countries, according to reports, although the original source or perpetrator of the attack has not yet been identified, according to Belnet.Law Enforcement, Parliament Meetings DisruptedThe Brussels Times Wednesday reported on some of the specific and ongoing effects of the attack across Belgium\u2019s public agencies. Belgium\u2019s Parliament had to postpone several meetings due to the attack, according to the report.The incident also took down access to online services for metropolitan police forces, such as those in Brussels and Antwerp, as well as the City of Brussels website. All have been restored as of Thursday morning in Europe.The attack also caused problems for distance learning at several universities and colleges, which continue to offer online services due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, as well as caused ticket-purchasing problems with Brussel\u2019s transit company, STIB.Belnet, the Center for Cybersecurity Belgium and other authorities and security organizations are continuing to monitor and investigate the situation, and Belnet has filed a complaint with Belgium\u2019s Federal Computer Crime Unit.Join Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d \u2013 a LIVE roundtable event on\u00a0Wed, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "Two high-ranked Apex Legends players have been banned from the platform for cheating by launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on an Xbox server.The players, who had achieved the rank of \u201cApex Predators\u201d in the console version of the game haven\u2019t been named, but the whole thing went down publicly on Reddit\u2019s r/apexlegends forum over the weekend.Confirmation of the ban came from the game\u2019s security analyst, Connor Ford, on Reddit, who first posted a video showing \u201cundeniable proof that the No. 4 and No. 6 Xbox Preds are DDoSing servers after we knock them,\u201d Ford wrote. \u201cI\u2019m posting on Twitter for more attention but please help get this traction. Console Ranked is literally unplayable with five of every six gamed being DDoSed in Pred lobbies.\u201dThe video was taken down following the ban, but Ford, who works for Apex Legends parent company Respawn, signaled more sweeping actions to come in a March 22 tweet.\u201cConsole reckoning for DDoSers and DDoS customers incoming,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide any of it.\u201dTop ranked \u2018Apex Legends\u2019 players banned over DDoS attack on XboxThe now-removed videos showed the top-ranking players get knocked down, then the game lost connectivity. When the honest players were able to rejoin, they were the ones knocked down and the offending ranked players were instead standing over them.Threatpost reached out to Respawn and Connor Ford for additional details but hasn\u2019t yet received a response.Cyberattacks On Gaming Are Like \u2018Digital Doping\u2019 Cyberattacks against gaming aren\u2019t anything new, but the stakes are higher than ever, which is driving innovation in gaming the games.\u201ceSports is a market where the top 10 teams are valued at about $2 billion in total, and where money is involved, there are folks trying to use dirty tricks,\u201d Dirk Schrader from New Net Technologies told Threatpost. \u201cWe might want to call it \u2018digital doping,\u2019 since as the tournaments and the prize pools are getting bigger, the likelihood of attacks and hacks is also growing. For businesses already affected by recent attacks (CD Projekt Red), it is time to include essential controls and protection mechanism to an appropriate level.\u201dThe rise of mobile gaming is also driving cyberthreats, including account takeover (ATO) attacks, according to Hank Schless with Lookout, a mobile security solutions provider.\u201cThey often achieve this by sending targeted mobile phishing links to steal their login credentials. What happens a lot is that threat actors will send a phishing link through the in-game messaging system, directing the player to a fake login page,\u201d Schless told Threatpost. \u201cUsually, the actor will pose as a member of the game\u2019s support team to convince the target to go to that fake page. This is just another iteration of mobile phishing. Malicious links can be sent to you through any app now, not just in emails.\u201dAttackers are also expanding into building alternate versions of games for distribution on third-party app stores without the same security protections as Google Play or iOS App Store, Schless explained.\u201cThese alternative apps are often trojanized, meaning they function like the legitimate version but have malicious code injected in them,\u201d Schless said.Gaming Security Too Invasive? Tim Wade who serves as the CTO of Vectra, which uses AI to find cyberattackers, said he becoming increasingly concerned about the flip side of the equation \u2014 that gaming companies becoming too aggressive and are developing anti-cheating solutions that Wade warns are increasingly invasive..\u201cSo long as games are played online, attempts at cheating will continue, and include all of the classic ways a traditional web application may be attacked \u2013 including exploiting weakness in client-side code, server-side injection, and yes even DDoS attacks against other players or infrastructure,\u201d Wade told Threatpost. \u201cHowever, what\u2019s most concerning to me is how invasive some of the anti-cheating countermeasures have become, essentially acting like rootkits and not only potentially creating a dangerous attack surface for users but also raising questions of precedents set for personal privacy.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)HacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks dropped significantly at the end of 2020, down 31 percent in the fourth quarter, according to researchers. The reason? Cybercriminals have switched their efforts (and their botnets) to cryptomining.According to an analysis from Kaspersky published\u00a0Tuesday, cybercriminals began repurposing infected devices for cryptomining in response to rising cryptocurrency values.\u201cA surge in cryptocurrency costs may have prompted cybercriminals to re-profile some botnets so that the command-and-control (C2) servers typically used in DDoS attacks could repurpose infected devices and use their computing power to mine cryptocurrencies instead,\u201d researchers said.DDoS Trends in Q4 2020 DDoS of course didn\u2019t go away \u2013 as people spent more time online in 2020, researchers observed a corresponding spike in DDoS attacks for most of the year. And in the fourth quarter, attacks schools in Sandwich and Tyngsboro, Mass., Telenor Norway and Laurentian University in Canada, according to Kaspersky. Online gaming services also continued to suffer DDoS attacks during the analyzed period.Q4 2020 attacks were down 31% but still up 10% year-over-year. Source: Kaspersky\u201cThe number of DDoS attacks was still 10 percent higher than the same period the year before, but overall reflected a declining trend, after attacks spiked dramatically in response to global lockdown measures earlier in the year,\u201d analysis explained.They added, \u201cCybercriminals used the names of well-known APT groups to intimidate victims, demanded ransoms in cryptocurrency, and carried out demonstration attacks to back up their threats.\u201dAnother notable attack in December targeted the website Bitcoin.org, which hosts Bitcoin Core, one of the most widely used software versions of Bitcoin.\u201cWhile the resource was down, cryptocurrency newbies were invited to download a copy of Bitcoin Core via a torrenting service,\u201d according to the report. \u201cMost likely, the attack is related to the Bitcoin price, which has steadily risen over the past quarter. According to one of the developers behind Bitcoin.org, the site is always hit whenever Bitcoin is on the up.\u201dAttacking Citrix ADCInterestingly, the DDoS perpetrators also began abusing Citrix application delivery controller (ADC) devices \u2013 specifically taking advantage of the interface for Datagram Transport Layer Security protocol is used to establish secure connections over UDP, through which most DNS queries, as well as audio and video traffic, are sent.Notable DDoS trends for Q4. Click to enlarge. Source: Kaspersky.\u201cTo amplify the attack, the attackers sent requests to devices with the DTLS interface enabled, spoofing victims\u2019 IP addresses,\u201d according to Kaspersky. \u201cConsequently, the victims received reply packets several times larger in size. In the case of Citrix devices, the amount of junk traffic could increase by up to 36 times. After the attacks came to light, the manufacturer promptly released a firmware update for configuring verification of incoming requests. For those who do not use DTLS, it is recommended to simply disable this protocol.\u201dKaspersky also found that there were no unexpected changes in the geographical distribution of DDoS attacks and targets. However, the top attack types shifted significantly: \u201cThe share of UDP flooding was up; ICMP attacks were displaced by GRE flooding. In addition, for the first time in our observation history, Linux botnets have almost totally captured the DDoS market.\u201dDDoS Predictions for 2021The macro-trends shaping 2021, such as the pandemic and cryptocurrency prices, remain unpredictable, Kaspersky noted. Thus when it comes to forecasting the current quarter\u2019s trend, researchers offered only a tentative assessment: A period of stability, with no major growth or decline, both in Q1 and throughout 2021.\u201cThe DDoS attack market is currently affected by two opposite trends,\u201d said Alexey Kiselev, business development manager on the Kaspersky DDoS Protection team. \u201cOn the one hand, people still highly rely on stable work of online resources, which can make DDoS attacks a common choice for malefactors. However, with a spike in cryptocurrency prices, it may be more profitable for them to infect some devices with miners. As a result, we see that the total number of DDoS attacks in Q4 remained quite stable. And we can predict that this trend will continue in 2021.\u201dHow to Protect Against DDoS AttacksTo stay protected against DDoS attacks, Kaspersky researchers noted that in addition to putting resources and technology in place, businesses should also validate third-party agreements and contact information, including those made with internet service providers.Threatpost WEBINAR: \u00a0Save your spot for\u00a0\u201c15 Cybersecurity Gaffes SMBs Make,\u201d a\u00a0\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Feb. 24 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Cybercriminals count on you making these mistakes, but our experts will help you lock down your small- to mid-sized business like it was a Fortune 100.\u00a0Register NOW\u00a0for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar on Wed., Feb. 24.\u00a0Most Recent ThreatListsWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals can exploit Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as a powerful tool to amplify distributed denial-of-service (DDoS attacks), new research has found.Attackers can abuse RDP to launch UDP reflection/amplification attacks with an amplification ratio of 85.9:1, principal engineer Roland Dobbins and senior network security analyst Steinthor Bjarnason from Netscout said in a report published online this week.However, not all RDP servers can be used in this way. It\u2019s possible only when the service is enabled on port UDP port 3389 running on standard TCP port 3389, researchers said.\nNetscout so far has identified more than 14,000 \u201cabusable\u201d Windows RDP servers that can be misused by attackers in DDoS attacks\u2014troubling news at a time when this type of attack is on the rise due to the increased volume of people online during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.This risk was highlighted earlier this week when researchers identified a new malware variant dubbed Freakout adding endpoints to a botnet to target Linux devices with DDoS attacks.What\u2019s more, while initially only advanced attackers with access to \u201cbespoke DDoS attack infrastructure\u201d used this method of amplification, researchers also observed RDP servers being abused in DDoS-for-hire services by so-called \u201cbooters,\u201d they said. This means \u201cthe general attacker population\u201d can also use this mode of amplification to add heft to their DDoS attacks.RDP is a part of the Microsoft Windows OS that provides authenticated remote virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) access to Windows-based workstations and servers. System administrators can configure RDP to run on TCP port 3389 and/or UDP port 3389.Attackers can send the amplified attack traffic, which is comprised of non-fragmented UDP packets that originate at UDP port 3389, to target a particular IP address and UDP port of choice, researchers said.\u201cIn contrast to legitimate RDP session traffic, the amplified attack packets are consistently 1,260 bytes in length, and are padded with long strings of zeroes,\u201d Dobbins and Bjarnason explained.Leveraging Windows RDP servers in this way has significant impact on victim organizations, including \u201cpartial or full interruption of mission-critical remote-access services,\u201d as well as other service disruptions due to transit capacity consumption and associated effects on network infrastructure, researchers said.\u201cWholesale filtering of all UDP/3389-sourced traffic by network operators may potentially overblock legitimate internet traffic, including legitimate RDP remote-session replies,\u201d researchers noted.To mitigate the use of RDP to amplify DDoS attacks and their related impact, researchers \u00a0made a number of suggestions to Windows systems administrators. First and foremost they should deploy Windows RDP servers behind VPN concentrators to prevent them from being abused to amplify DDoS attacks, they said.\u201cNetwork operators should perform reconnaissance to identify abusable Windows RDP servers on their networks and/or the networks of their downstream customers,\u201d Dobbins and Bjarnason advised. \u201cIt is strongly recommended that RDP servers should be accessible only via VPN services in order to shield them from abuse.\u201dIf this mitigation is not possible, however, they \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that at the very least, system administrators disable RDP via UDP port 3389 \u201cas an interim measure,\u201d they said.Internet access network traffic from internal organizational personnel should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links.At the same time, network operators should implement Best Current Practices (BCPs) for all relevant network infrastructure, architecture and operations, including \u201csituationally specific network-access policies that only permit internet traffic via required IP protocols and ports, researchers said.Internet-access network traffic from internal organizational personnel also should be deconflated from internet traffic to/from public-facing internet properties and served via separate upstream internet transit links, they added.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World, sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch with Threatpost and I am joined by Tara Seals, withThreatpost\u00a0to break down the top news from the week ended October 16. Tara, how was your week?Tara Seals:\u00a0Oh, pretty good, Lindsey. It was super busy as things in cybersecurity usually are. But this week was a little busier than most with Patch Tuesday and everything.LO: Yeah, we had a ton of news coming out of Patch Tuesday, whether it was Adobe Flash flaws that were being patched or Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday security updates. And I know there was a fair amount that came out from the Microsoft standpoint, which you covered, Tara, what were you finding there?TS: So it was an interesting Patch Tuesday, because it had fewer than 100 CVEs this month, which that was the first time in seven months that has happened. So that was sort of exciting I think for IT administrators everywhere, not to have to worry so much about so many. But there are also a couple of notable bugs; well, first of all, there were six bugs that were listed that had been previously disclosed in some way, shape or form, but didn\u2019t have patches. And so those obviously are of concern. And there\u2019s already a few proof-of-concept exploits for those that are laying around. And they [Microsoft] don\u2019t always have previously disclosed bugs that they have to fix. So that was pretty notable that they had six of them.And then there were a couple of critical bags that really stood out to most of the researchers that I talked to. One of which they\u2019re calling the \u201cping of death,\u201d which I think is kind of hilarious, but it\u2019s accurate. It\u2019s basically a bug in Outlook, Microsoft Outlook, and it can be triggered, essentially, just by sending an email to someone. And because the attack vector is the Preview Pane, which is the default view \u2013 Outlook users everywhere will be familiar with us, when you receive an email, it just pops up in this Preview Pane that you can see \u2013 and so this particular bug, in order to be exploited, somebody can just send an email, it pops up in the Preview Pane, and then [the exploit] becomes triggered. And it allows attackers to execute remote code. So obviously, it\u2019s concerning. And it\u2019s also extremely exploitable and trivial to to carry out.LO: Right. Well, it definitely seemed like there were a ton of Microsoft bugs to come out this week. But as you mentioned, less than what we usually see. And that was the same with Adobe. I mean, I think in previous months, Adobe has had way more than the one flaw that it patched this week. So not sure what\u2019s the reasoning behind that. But as you said, it\u2019s always less of a headache for system admins to have to deal with.TS:\u00a0Yeah, for sure. Well, and I think especially given the fact that we\u2019ve had so much Zerologon news, that horrible bug that security teams are rushing to patch even as everybody from nation-state actors to financially motivated people in their basement are looking to exploit it. So, you know, I think it\u2019s it\u2019s probably good to not add too much insult to injury this month.LO: Right. Companies have so much on their plates already in terms of like ongoing hacks and cyberattacks. For instance, you just on Thursday covered a newly announced Barnes and Noble hack, which as someone who shopped at Barnes and Noble a lot I love to read that was not great to read about.TS: Yeah, that story\u2019s a little bit crazy. So we also got the email notice. And it came in the wee hours of the morning. I think my husband\u2019s arrived at like, 1:30 or something in the morning, Thursday morning, so they kind of sent this out under cover of darkness, which I\u2019m sure they want to minimize the publicity around it, but that\u2019s not going to happen because it\u2019s Barnes and Noble.So the issue is that, what was really interesting about this, is that nobody knows, they haven\u2019t confirmed yet, what kind of cyberattack. Only that there was one. But over the weekend, the Nook e-book reader \u2013 which my mom has one of those and they\u2019re kind of awesome \u2013 but the syncing feature for that went down and there was this outage that continued and it just kind of trended on a low level, nobody really knew what was going on. And that stretched across the week. And then they come out Thursday, well Wednesday night into Thursday morning, saying that there had been a cyberattack.So people started putting two and two together, thinking, \u201chmm, perhaps this might be a ransomware attack.\u201d Again, unconfirmed, but I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get more details. Sme of the systems that were impacted by this contained a lot of personal shopper information. Fortunately, not financial data, but definitely things like purchase histories, the lists of books that people have bought in the past, along with their email, telephone numbers and other personal information like that, that basically it would be a dream for a phisher to mount some scam emails that are personalized and very convincing.LO: Right? Yeah, I was gonna ask, I mean, if an attacker has the fact that someone reads, you know, say, Stephen King novels and their email address, what kind of phishing lures could potentially be strung together from this? I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s plenty of different avenues that cyber criminals could could go there.TS: Oh, definitely. I mean, can you imagine, especially, you know, around Halloween and the Stephen King reference, I mean, you could basically say, \u201cHey, I know that you just bought Doctor Sleep. So you might be interested, here\u2019s some other recommendations.\u201d And they could use some Barnes and Noble graphics and make it very convincing and look like, \u201cbecause you read this, you might like this, click here to order\u201d and then they can harvest all the information.LO: Right, they didn\u2019t yet confirm that the data was actually stolen but I\u2019m sure that this could definitely be serious if it had been.TS:\u00a0Well, right. And that brings up another issue around this incident, the fact that they don\u2019t know if the data is stolen, what kind of IT staff do they have working over there? It\u2019s a [almost] Fortune 500 company. It\u2019s mystifying to me, the amount of information they don\u2019t appear to actually know. And also, the financial data was all encrypted, which is good. So the credit cards, payment cards are all tokenized. And they said they could not really be lifted. But the personal information, I mean, what was it, just left out there in plain text in the database somewhere? I actually emailed them to ask about some of these details. So hopefully, they\u2019ll get back to me, and I\u2019ll be able to do a follow-up story. Because it really is concerning that the IT staff a), doesn\u2019t appear to know what happened. And b), they were not protecting customer data in the way that most people would assume that they would be.LO: I know that other readers had kind of taken to Twitter, as you had mentioned in your article, to air their complaints about, as you said, the late night email notice \u2013 it does seem a little skeevy.TS: \u00a0Yeah. It was a little bit like, \u201coh nothing to see here. Maybe you\u2019ll miss this because it came in at 1:30 in the morning.\u201dLO: Yeah, exactly.TS: And also it was kind of funny, because some of the people on Twitter too, are saying, what are cybercriminals going do with my reading list? So I think it\u2019s really important to stress to people that, you know, they can do quite a lot with a reading list as seen in our Stephen King example. It\u2019s important to keep in mind for sure.LO: Right, right. It\u2019s just another piece of information that can be used for a lure for spear phishing, or phishing attacks. So that\u2019s definitely important to note.Well looking at some of the other big stories from this week, one that really stuck out to me that I wrote about was a new research article on how companies have continued to receive these extortion emails that are threatening to launch a DDoS attack on their network unless they pay up. So this is part of this overarching DDoS extortion campaign that\u2019s been going on since August. But I guess the campaign started in mid-August and has ramped up at the end of September and the start of October. So it\u2019s really been on the increase as of recently. And what was the kind of the big news there is that Travelex, the British Foreign Exchange company, was reportedly one of their recent high-profile threat recipients of this type of campaign.TS: Yeah, for sure. Well, and I mean, I think it\u2019s really interesting too, that this is just another sort of \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t want to say ransomware because it\u2019s not ransomware \u2013 but, you know, the extortion attempts, the ransom attempts, obviously it\u2019s worked from the encryption malware standpoint. So now they\u2019re shifting to trying different tactics to extort companies, you know, with their data. And I think that\u2019s really, really fascinating. Just another way to make systems inaccessible, right?LO: I think the key difference is that ransomware attacks have already happened. Whereas in this case, organizations, the attackers are going to organizations and saying, if you don\u2019t pay up, we\u2019re going to launch this attack in the future. So it makes you wonder if this is a little less serious, or maybe impactful in that organizations have that opportunity to harden their security. However, I did talk to researchers with Radware. And they were telling me that these threats aren\u2019t hoaxes. And the actors have followed up with attacks. So that makes it all the more critical to make sure that companies have the right security measures in place.There were also a couple of interesting things that stuck out to me about this campaign. And first of all, the first one was that attackers were claiming that if victims don\u2019t pay up, I think it was, you know, the equivalent of $230,000 in Bitcoin, then they would have the ability to launch an attack, that would peak at 2 terabytes per second. And that\u2019s a massive claim. I mean, just to give some context there, I believe the largest volumetric, DDoS attack on record, as of February, at least, was on an Amazon Web Services client. And that reached the levels of 2.3 terabytes per second. So I mean, that\u2019s that\u2019s a pretty massive claim. And another thing to know is that there\u2019s no evidence that the claims that the cyber criminals are making about this level of volumetric attack are true. Researchers with Radware told me they hadn\u2019t observed the two terabyte per second attack threatened in the letter in the report, however, orgs have seen attacks ranging up to 300 gigabytes per second, that combined multiple attack vectors, so the threat is there, but it might not be at the same level that they are claiming they can reach.TS:\u00a0That\u2019s fascinating, actually, because you don\u2019t know. Do you want to test those waters? Are you gonna call the bluff? And even if it\u2019s not even that large of an attack, if it still takes out your systems, who cares [how big it is]? I wonder if part of that claim and boasting has anything to do with the fact that they\u2019re trying to pose as these advanced threat groups, these APTs that are known to be extremely well-resourced. You know, they\u2019re masquerading as groups like Fancy Bear\u00a0and Lazarus. So maybe they\u2019re trying to claim that they have the same types of capabilities that those groups have.LO: I think they are trying to pretend to be these APT groups, and really try to kind of play into the emotions there of different companies in different sectors. For instance, I think it was depending on the vertical, they would have a preference of different APT. So you know, when they were targeting financial orgs, they were purporting to be Lazarus group. So I think they\u2019re really trying to play into that fear factor there.And another method that they use as well is that they threatened to up their ransom by 10 bitcoins for each day that it\u2019s not paid. And they don\u2019t have any other way for the victims to reach out to them, other than the Bitcoin address to send the payments too so there\u2019s no, there\u2019s no way to respond to them or try to negotiate. I mean, the threats just there. I think that there is kind of a level of fear there that companies will probably have when they get these types of threats. And I mean, these attacks, \u00a0DDoS attacks can be pretty damaging for companies. I remember, I think it was in 2016 the DDoS attack of DYN that disrupted the internet. And you know, I\u2019ll never forget trying to get onto Netflix that morning and being frustrated that I was down. So I think these do have kind of a real world effect.TS:\u00a0Oh, yeah, for sure that attack was absolutely insane. And, yeah, let\u2019s hope that this doesn\u2019t snowball into something that becomes as endemic as ransomware attempts. It\u2019s pretty frightening for businesses today, I think.LO: Yeah. And I mean, this has also been going on, I was kind of doing some research into DDoS extortion attacks, and I mean, this has been going on for many, many years, too. It\u2019s not that new, even back in 2015, the FBI was saying it saw an increase in the number of companies being targeted by these types of scammers who are threatening to launch these attacks if they don\u2019t pay a ransom. So I think that what this shows is that attackers are still upping their game and changing up their tactics and innovating to find new ways to target companies. And I think it\u2019s working as we saw with Travelex, which, by the way, which has had some bad juju with security this past year.TS: Yeah, that\u2019s the last thing they need for sure. Okay, well, Lindsey, the other thing that you covered this week that really stood out to me \u2013 when I saw it I was like, aha, finally \u2013 was Zoom finally debuting their end to end encryption service. What,s that all about? How\u2019s the rollout going to progress?LO: Yeah, so I believe it was yet or Wednesday when Zoom announced is rolling out a technical preview for its end to end encryption into its platform. So what that means is, it\u2019s going to have four phases of the rollout. And the first one will be mainly to solicit feedback from users during the first 30 days, so they can kind of roll it out and flush out any any issues and try to stomp out any, any problems there. And what\u2019s interesting here, too, is that kind of the background here with Zoom and end to end encryption. It\u2019s faced plenty of issues around its encryption policies, including the fact that there was a lot of backlash around Zoom, telling users that it offered full encryption as a marketing term. That received a lot of backlash from kind of privacy and security experts who said that there\u2019s a distinction between encryption and end to end encryption. And then there was another incident in May when Zoom announced it would actually offer end to end encryption but only to paid users, which as you can imagine, also garnered plenty of controversy from privacy advocates who were saying that security measures should be free to all, so it definitely has had its fair share of issues around encryption leading up to\u00a0this.TS: Yeah. And that\u2019s kind of interesting, because I went to a roundtable discussion that had the CISO for Zoom on there, a couple weeks ago, and I actually asked him what the plans were for this and whether or not his company is still wrestling with some of the backlash effects from not only the encryption debacle, but also just all the other problems. And, he dodged the question, which was somewhat understandable. I mean, they didn\u2019t want to open the kimono, so to speak, on their plans before they were ready to pull the trigger, which I totally get. But, you know, he did say that they\u2019ve had some growing pains, and they absolutely were not prepared for the spike in usage around the pandemic. And so yeah, that\u2019s kind of it\u2019s kind of interesting. I mean, this is like watching growing pains in action. But hopefully this rollout will go well. And I know a lot of people that use Zoom for business, especially I\u2019ve got some medical-professional people in my circle, doctors and whatnot, that use it all the time. And I always I always kind of cringe like, are you sure you want to use Zoom, but maybe with this, everything will be a little bit more secure. And people can rest a little easier when they use that service.LO: \u00a0Yeah, you have to give Zoom some credit here for actually going ahead and rolling this out. And I will say, despite all the security issues that they\u2019ve had \u2013 and they have had plenty since the pandemic started \u2013 I think they have been doing a good job of kind of stepping up to the plate and trying to address these different issues. And, they acquired Keybase, to kind of bolster their encryption there and are now kind of rolling this out. So I think there is two things to note that I thought was important for Zoom users to think about, first of all, this isn\u2019t on by default, so users will need to turn the feature on manually. And then the second thing is that there is an enabling the feature might disable certain other features in Zoom. And I just thought that was kind of interesting to note, but some of the other features that might be disabled are the ability to join before the host and cloud recording and streaming and live transcription, breakout rooms, etc, etc. So just kind of two small tidbits there to keep in mind for Zoom users.TS: Yeah, it\u2019s kind of interesting how taking things offline from Zoom servers, taking the communication sort of away from flowing through the Zoom servers, impacts technically, from a technology perspective, all these other types of bells and whistles, so people will have to make a value judgment, I guess, or a risk assessment and figure out what they like more. You know: private chats or encryption.LO:\u00a0Well, yeah, so that rolls out next week. So we will be keeping an eye on the the launch there. And hopefully that rollout goes well. But, Tara, I think we, we have reached the end of the news wrap here. So thanks for coming on to talk about the biggest cybersecurity news stories of the week.TS: Yeah, for sure. Thanks for having me, Lindsay, as always, and I hope you have a good weekend and catch you next week.LO: You as well and that to all of our listeners.

        "raw text": "Companies worldwide have continued to receive extortion emails threatening to launch a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on their network, unless they pay up \u2013 with British foreign-exchange company Travelex reportedly being one recent high-profile threat recipient.Researchers said that since mid-August, several companies have been sent emails that warn that their company network will be hit by a DDoS attack in about a week.\u00a0The initial ransom demand is set at 20 BTC \u2013 which translates to about $230,000 at the time of writing \u2013 and cybercriminals threaten to increase that ransom by 10 BTC for each day not paid, said researchers.While a high level of activity was first tracked in August, that activity then slowed down in the first half of September \u2013 only to \u201cgrow significantly\u201d in the end of September and beginning of October, Radware researchers told Threatpost.Travelex (which has undergone its fair share of security woes over the past year, starting with a New Year\u2019s ransomware attack) was one such org threatened with a DDoS attack, unless it paid 20 bitcoins (BTC), Intel471 researchers reported on Tuesday. A bitcoin wallet address in the email shows that Travelex did not pay the attackers at any point, they said.\u201cFollowing the extortion email, the threat actor conducted a volumetric attack on a custom port of four IP addresses serving the company\u2019s subdomains,\u201d according to Intel471 researchers. \u201cTwo days later, the attackers carried out another DNS amplification attack against Travelex using Google DNS servers.\u201dThreatpost has reached out to Travelex for further comment on the DDoS extortion threat.Ongoing DDoS Extortion ThreatsWhile the ransom DDoS campaign has been ongoing since August and has received widespread coverage, researchers with Radware said in a Wednesday post that they are continuing to see companies worldwide receive the extortion emails \u2013 and that attackers are becoming more sophisticated.\u201cThere is no way to communicate with the blackmailers, so there is no option to negotiate and the only way to get a message through is by sending BTC to the bitcoin address mentioned in the letter,\u201d researchers said.The extortion emails claim that the threat group has already launched a small DDoS attack on the victim\u2019s IPs (of the ASN number mentioned in the letter) to give the threat legitimacy. The attackers also claim that they have the ability to perform volumetric attacks that peak at 2Tbps \u2013 almost reaching the levels of the 2.3Tbps attack targeting an Amazon Web Services client in February that was the largest volumetric DDoS attack on record.\u201cThese threats are not hoaxes, and the actors have followed up with attacks,\u201d Pascal Geenens,\u00a0director of threat intelligence at Radware, told Threatpost. \u201cWhile we have not observed the 2TBps attack threatened in the letter included the report, organizations have seen attacks ranging up to 300GBps and combining multiple attack vectors. These attacks can be devastating for many organizations.\u201dA sample DDoS ransom letter. Credit: RadwareOf note, the extortion threats were sent to generic email addresses within the companies, which did not always reach the right person in the organization \u2013 and were even sometimes received by subsidiaries of companies in the wrong country. However, while earlier iterations of the ransom note were elementary, researchers observed the threat actor increasing their sophistication.\u201cThe letters have been improved since the start of the campaign by fixing some typos, rephrasing some actions for better clarity, and press coverage of earlier DDoS attacks that impacted financial organizations has been added to instill more fear,\u201d said researchers.The threat actor purports to be various APTs, posing as Fancy Bear, Armada Collective and Lazarus Group. \u00a0The actors seem to have a preference of APT depending on the vertical they are trying to convince to pay a ransom: The cybercriminals purport to be Lazarus Group when targeting financial organizations, (such as in Travelex\u2019s case, for instance), while they pretend to be Fancy Bear while targeting technology and manufacturing orgs.However, researchers pointed to discrepencies that show that the threat actors are merely posing as these APTs as opposed to being the real deal: \u201cBased on what we know about the standard tactics, techniques and procedures of these APT groups, the threat activity that we are seeing does not match up,\u201d Geenens told Threatpost. \u201cAttribution is mostly guesswork, and it\u2019s impossible to make an absolute statement one way or another. Even if an APT group were to admit to these threats, it would be impossible to confirm whether they are even telling the truth.\u201dIt\u2019s worth noting that these ransom threats are nothing new. In 2019, cybercriminals posing as Fancy Bear launched DDoS attacks against companies in the financial sector and demanded ransom payments. And back in 2016, a group (who also called themselves the Armada Collective) sent extortion emails to various online businesses threatening to launch DDoS attacks if they weren\u2019t paid in Bitcoin. All the way back in 2015, the FBI said that it was seeing an increase in the number of companies being targeted by scammers threatening to launch DDoS attacks if they don\u2019t pay a ransom.In their ransom letters, attackers claim there are no counter-measures to protect against their attacks. Researchers said this isn\u2019t the case, and advised organizations to not pay the ransom demand: \u201cThere is no guarantee blackmailers will honor the terms of their letter,\u201d they said. \u201cPaying only funds future operations, allows them to improve their capabilities and motivates them to continue the campaign.\u201dHacksVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The first half of 2020 saw a significant uptick in the number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks compared to the same period last year \u2014 a phenomenon that appears to be directly correlated to the global coronavirus pandemic.Neustar\u2019s Security Operations Center (SOC) saw a 151 percent increase in DDoS activity in the period, including one of the largest and longest attacks that Neustar has ever mitigated \u2013 that attack came in at 1.17 terabits-per-second (Tbps), and lasted five days and 18 hours.\u201cThese figures are representative of the growing number, volume and intensity of network-type cyberattacks as organizations shifted to remote operations and workers\u2019 reliance on the internet increased,\u201d the company noted in its first-half status report, released on Wednesday.Click to register.DDoS attacks are getting bigger, with what Neustar said is a \u201cnoticeable spike\u201d in volume: The number of attacks sized 100Gbps and above grew a whopping 275 percent. Emblematic of this is a 2.3Tbps attack targeting an Amazon Web Services client in February \u2013 the largest volumetric DDoS attack on record. And the aforementioned 1.17Tbps attack was 192 percent bigger than the largest attack the company mitigated during the first half of 2019.That said, the increase in the total number of attacks was felt across all size categories, with even attacks sized 5Gbps increasing by more than 200 percent. Overall, small attacks sized 5Gbps and below represented 70 percent of all attacks mitigated by Neustar between January and June.\u201cWhile large volumetric attacks capture attention and headlines, bad actors increasingly recognize the value of striking at low enough volume to bypass the traffic thresholds that would trigger mitigation to degrade performance or precision target vulnerable infrastructure like a VPN,\u201d said Michael Kaczmarek, Neustar vice president of security products, in a statement. \u201cThese shifts put every organization with an internet presence at risk of a DDoS attack.\u201dHe added that the threat that is particularly critical with global workforces working remotely. The snowballing of growth across all DDoS metrics correlates with the COVID-19 pandemic and companies sending their employees home to work.That workforce shift has contributed to higher than ever internet traffic: Neustar reported that internet use is up between 50 and 70 percent, while streaming video rose more than 12 percent in the first quarter alone.\u201cThis has meant that attackers of all types, whether serious cybercriminals or bored teenagers stuck at home, have had more screen time to be disruptive,\u201d according to the report.The firm added that other aspects contribute to the rise in attacks as well, like the fact that firms are often heavily reliant on VPNs these days for secure remote access: \u201cVPN servers are often left vulnerable, making it simple for cybercriminals to take an entire workforce offline with a targeted DDoS attack.\u201dAlso, while the most-hit website segments are still the traditional quarry of e-commerce and gaming sites, DDoS-ers are now focused more on healthcare organizations that contain sensitive patient information and a growing number of insecure IoT devices; and, online video traffic for services like Zoom is booming \u2013 and unsurprisingly, attacks in this vertical has increased by 461 percent over the last six months, researchers said.Source: NeustarMeanwhile, attackers are also mounting more sophisticated attacks than ever before. Almost half (52 percent) of the threats leveraged three vectors or more, with the number of attacks featuring a single vector \u201cessentially nonexistent,\u201d according to the report.Neustar also tracked new amplification methods, which are contributing to more intense attacks. An attack of more than 800 millions-of-packets-per-second (Mpps) was recorded during the analysis period \u2013 compared to the previous record of 500 Mpps.These methods include an increase in burst and pulse DDoS attacks, broadening abuse of built-in network protocols such as ARMS, WS-DD, CoAP and Jenkins to launch DDoS amplification attacks that can be carried out with limited resources and cause significant disruptions, NXNS attacks targeting DNS servers, RangeAmp attacks targeting content delivery networks (CDNs), and a resurgence of Mirai-like malware capable of building large botnets through the exploitation of poorly secured IoT devices.The attacks dovetail with similar findings by researchers in August.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.Web Security",

        "raw text": "The number of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks spiked in the second quarter of 2020, researchers said.According to the latest Kaspersky quarterly DDoS attacks report, DDoS events were three times more frequent in comparison to the second quarter last year (up 217 percent), and were up 30 percent from the number of DDoS attacks observed in the first quarter of 2020.The typical annual trend for DDoS is for attacks to spike at the beginning of the year, during the peak season for businesses; while they tend to fall off in late spring and summer. Kaspersky researchers pointed out that the number of attacks in Q2 2019 fell by 39 percent compared to Q1 2019; with a similar trend seen in 2018.What\u2019s different this year is the obvious: The coronavirus pandemic. Simply put, more people than usual are online for both personal and work-related activities, making for an attractive target for cybercrime of all stripes \u2013 and DDoS is no exception.\u201cKaspersky experts believe the rise in malicious activity can be attributed to the impact of COVID-19, as both cybercriminals and their targets have had to reconsider their summer plans,\u201d the firm said, in research released on Monday. \u201cThe pandemic and subsequent social-distancing restrictions have significantly changed people\u2019s lives and many are either spending their days off in \u2018staycation\u2019 mode or have cancelled their scheduled holidays. This change in summer plans has had unexpected consequences, like an increased number of DDoS attacks.\u201dThe average number of attacks per day also increased; the biggest number of attacks per day was almost 300 this quarter (April 9); while in the first quarter, the record was 242 attacks.Educational and government institutions were targeted the most frequently in the second quarter; however, that said, education-sector attacks decreased sharply starting in the second half of June, which could be attributed to the start of the summer break.The top three most-attacked geographies were mainland China (65.12 percent), the United States (20.28 percent) and Hong Kong (6.08 percent). Romania dropped out of the top 10 compared to the first quarter, and was ranked the 17th, whereas Great Britain rose from the 18th to the 10th position.These top three also topped the charts in terms of both the number of targets and the number of attacks: Mainland China came in at 66.02 percent; the United States accounted for 19.32 percent; and Hong Kong (6.34 percent).Among the other interesting data points, the firm saw that DDoS botnet activity increased on Wednesdays and Thursdays and decreased on Saturdays. And most attacks only lasted about 20 minutes. The longest attacks lasted a few days (215, 214 and 210 hours were the top), which is more than half the number of the first quarter\u2019s longest-lasting attacks (about 19 days).The difference between Q1 and Q2 through 2018-2020. Q1 of each year is taken as 100 percent.SYN flood remains the main DDoS attack tool (94.7 percent), while ICMP attacks accounted for 4.9 percent \u2013 other types of DDoS attacks were rarely seen. However, Kaspersky noted that two new DDoS amplification methods were discovered last quarter.One is an exploit for a DNS server vulnerability in the DNS delegation process.\u201cThe vulnerability exploitation scheme was dubbed NXNSAttack,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe hacker sends to a legitimate recursive DNS server a request to several subdomains within the authoritative zone of its own malicious DNS server. In response, the malicious server delegates the request to a large number of fake NS servers within the target domain without specifying their IP addresses. As a result, the legitimate DNS server queries all of the suggested subdomains, which leads to traffic growing 1620 times.\u201d The issue is patched in the latest version of DNS server software.The other amplification method, named RangeAmp, exploits HTTP range requests that allow downloading files in parts. A malicious range request can increase the traffic load on content delivery networks (CDNs) by anywhere between 724 and 43,330 times.The uptick in cybercrime is continuing as the pandemic drags on. In late July, research findings showed that ransomware attacks are up, particularly in the U.S., where they have more than doubled year-over-year (up 109 percent). Meanwhile, malware targeting IoT devices has risen to 20.2 million, up 50 percent from this time last year \u2013 as cybercriminals target the massive influx of employees working from home.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "A new variant of the Hoaxcalls botnet, which can be marshalled for large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) campaigns, is spreading via an unpatched vulnerability impacting the ZyXEL Cloud CNM SecuManager that was disclosed last month.That\u2019s according to researchers at Radware, who also said that it\u2019s notable how quickly Hoaxcalls operators have moved to weaponize the ZyXel bug, which as of this time of writing, has still not been addressed in a ZyXel advisory.The Rise of HoaxcallsHoaxcalls first emerged in late March, as a variant of the Gafgyt/Bashlite family; it\u2019s named after the domain used to host its malware, Hoaxcalls.pw.According to the Palo Alto Unit 42 researchers who found it, the original sample featured three DDoS attack vectors: UDP, DNS and HEX floods; and, it was seen infecting devices through two vulnerabilities: A DrayTek Vigor2960 remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerability and a GrandStream Unified Communications remote SQL injection bug (CVE-2020-5722). The HTTP exploits for the bugs used a common User-Agent header value, \u201cXTC,\u201d which has been seen in previous Mirai variant activity, according to researchers.In early April, a new Hoaxcalls sample showed up on the scene and was picked up by Radware. It had added 16 new attack vectors for a total of 19, but it only propagated via the GrandStream CVE-2020-5722 bug and lacked the XTC header value. Within 48 hours of discovery, there were 15 unique IP addresses hosting the malware.Then, earlier this week, on April 20, Radware researchers spotted a third iteration of Hoaxcalls being disseminated from 75 different malware-hosting servers. It has the same number of attack vectors (19) as the second variant, and also uses the User-Agent \u201cXTC\u201d header seen in the initial version.\u201cWhile IoT botnet variants are common, these samples highlight not only the speed in which criminals move, but also the depth and scope of the campaigns run by DDoS operators,\u201d noted Radware researchers, in an analysis posted on Wednesday.ZyXel RCE BugThe April 20 variant most notably uses an unpatched vulnerability in the ZyXEL Cloud CNM SecuManager, which is a network management appliance designed to provide an integrated console to monitor and manage security gateways.In March, multiple bugs were found to be riddling the platform by security researchers Pierre Kim and Alexandre Torres. According to their report at the time, the vulnerable software includes Zyxel CNM SecuManager versions 3.1.0 and 3.1.1 \u2013 last updated in November 2018.The bug that Hoaxcalls is specifically leveraging can be exploited via API calls that abuse the path \u201c/live/CPEManager/AXCampaignManager/delete_cpes_by_ids?Cpe_ids =\u201d according to Radware.Digging deeper, Kim and Torres characterized this bug as \u201cabusing an insecure API due to unsafe calls to eval():\u201d. When an API call is made, the output is stored in the \u201cAxess\u201d chroot, which the researchers said ultimately makes it possible to open up a \u201cconnect-back\u201d shell, providing access to the appliance.A chroot is an operation to change a root directory for a running process and its dependent directories on Unix operating systems,\u201cEven if the shell is within a chrooted environment, it is possible to break the chroot using a [local privilege escalation] LPE and the fact that /proc is mounted inside the chroot,\u201d Kim and Torres wrote.The addition of the unpatched bug exploit only widens the number of routers and IoT devices that can be used by Hoaxcalls going forward, Radware researchers noted \u2014 adding that they expect the attack surface to continue to widen.\u201cThe campaigns performed by the actor or group behind XTC and Hoaxcalls include several variants using different combinations of propagation exploits and DDoS attack vectors,\u201d Radware researchers said in the analysis. \u201cIt is our opinion that the group behind this campaign is dedicated to finding and leveraging new exploits for the purpose of building a botnet that can be leveraged for large-scale DDoS attacks.\u201dWorried about your cloud security in the work-from-home era?

        "raw text": "The last 30 days has seen a renewed increase in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) activity, according to researchers, who said that they have observed a number of criminal campaigns mounting TCP reflection DDoS attacks against corporations.Researchers at Radware said that the list of victims include a number of large companies, including Amazon, IBM subsidiary SoftLayer, Eurobet Italia SRL, Korea Telecom, HZ Hosting and SK Broadband.The first major event in October took the Eurobet network down. Eurobet, an online sports gambling website, suffered a campaign that persisted for days and impacted several other betting networks, according to Radware.Then, later in October, amid a flurry of DDoS attacks targeting companies in nearly every vertical around the world, the firm identified another large-scale multi-vector campaign surfaced that targeting the financial and telecommunication industry in Italy, South Korea and Turkey.\u201cThis attack was noticed by the security community due to the reflective nature of one of the attack vectors,\u201d the researchers noted. \u201cIn a period of 24 hours, millions of TCP-SYN packets from nearly 7,000 distinct source IP addresses part of [the infrastructure of Turkish provider] Garanti Bilisim Teknolojisi ve Ticaret TR.A.S. were sensed globally and specifically targeting ports 22, 25, 53, 80 and 443.\u201dThe activity is a continuation of an uptick in attackers leveraging TCP reflection attacks that began in 2018, according to the firm. These tend to be low bandwidth, but they generate high packet rates (increased volumes of packets per second) that require large amounts of resources from network devices to process the traffic and cause outages. That\u2019s why large corporate and telecom networks are often targets, Radware researchers explained.The specific type of TCP attack used in the recent spate of DDoS efforts were TCP SYN-ACK reflection attacks. In this scenario, an attacker sends a spoofed SYN packet, with the original source IP replaced by the victim\u2019s IP address, to a range of random or pre-selected reflection IP addresses. The services at the reflection addresses reply with a SYN-ACK packet to the victim of the spoofed attack. If the victim does not respond, the reflection service will continue to retransmit the SYN-ACK packet, resulting in amplification. The amount of amplification depends on the number of SYN-ACK retransmits by the reflection service, which can be defined by the attacker.Most of the targeted networks did not respond properly to the spoofed requests, which would have disabled the TCP retransmit amplification, according to the analysis.The impact range of these kinds of campaigns is significant, according to Radware, degrading service at the targeted networks as well as reflection networks across the world.\u201cNot only do the targeted victims, who are often large and well-protected corporations, have to deal with floods of TCP traffic, but randomly selected reflectors, ranging from smaller businesses to homeowners, have to process the spoofed requests and potential legitimate replies from the target of the attack,\u201d researchers wrote in a recent post. \u201cThose that are not prepared for these kinds of spikes in traffic suffer from secondary outages, with SYN floods one of the perceived side-effects by the collateral victims.\u201dIn the more recent TCP reflection attacks, the firm\u2019s forensics showed that the attackers leveraged a large majority of the internet IPv4 address space as reflector, with a spoofed source originating from either bots or servers hosted on subnets and by without IP source address verification.The 2019 activity follows an 11 percent dip in the number of DDoS attacks in the fourth quarter of 2018, following the FBI\u2019s crackdown on 15 DDoS-for-hire sites.What are the top risks to modern enterprises in the peak era of data breaches?

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals posing as the Russian APT group Fancy Bear have been launching DDoS attacks against companies in the financial sector and demanding ransom payments, according to a new report.The large-scale, multi-vector DDoS attacks come with accompanying ransom letter. They started about a week ago against financial companies mainly located in Singapore, South Africa, and some Scandinavian countries, according to the report, which also published a copy of the ransom letter.The group, which appears to actually own a DDoS botnet, is asking victims for payments of two Bitcoin. On Monday morning, one Bitcoin was selling for about $9,300.The attacks also demonstrate that the group is doing its research when it comes to victims, according to the report. Rather than attack victim websites, the group is going after back-end servers, which aren\u2019t usually protected by DDoS mitigation systems and thus have a good chance at causing system downtime, the report noted.Three security companies\u2014Link11, Radware and Group-IB\u2014confirmed the attacks, according to the report. The first two provide DDoS mitigation services, while the third provides cybersecurity services to the financial sector.Fancy Bear is perhaps most well-known for its hack of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election; it also hit the committee\u2019s site again, hacked Republican think-tanks, and spread fake social media sites leading up to the U.S. midterm elections in 2018.More recently, Fancy Bear was seen trying to influence the May elections in the European Union (EU) as part of a history of attempting to get involved in elections there. The group also was responsible for hacking and disinformation attacks during the French and German presidential elections in 2017. Generally, the group\u2019s aim seems to be to create chaos and discord in democratic processes by using cyber-espionage and influence campaigns.Impersonators are common when a hacking group proves successful at cybercriminal activity, as other bad actors like to take advantage of the notoriety of an existing group to mount their own attacks. This impersonation seems slightly off the mark, however, as neither the type of attacks nor targets are consistent with Fancy Bear\u2019s typical mode of operation.Indeed, impersonation often is a clear sign that hackers \u201cdon\u2019t have the skills or the firepower of a group who can actually cause damage,\u201d said Mounir Hahad, head of Juniper Threat Labs at Juniper Networks.\u201cMost of the time, botnets for DDoS attacks are rented for a fee,\u201d he said in an email to Threatpost. \u201cThe more funds you have, the more serious a threat you can pose, within some limits.\u201dHahad encourages those targeted by the Fancy Bear impostors to not pay the ransom, for two reasons. One is that \u201cit will only finance the cyber-gang for future operations,\u201d and the other is that the victim becomes known as \u201ca target that pays at the first threat,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0Editor's PicksMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "UPDATEAkamai Wednesday revealed that it\u2019s witnessed the fourth-largest DDoS attack the company has ever encountered, leveraging a widespread and highly exploitable UDP amplification technique known as WS-Discovery (WSD).WSD\u2014a consumer device network discovery and connectivity technology\u2014was seen targeting one of Akamai\u2019s customers in the gaming industry, according to a blog post attributed to Akamai Security Intelligence Response Team Engineer Jonathan Respeto.Attacks targeting networks using this method are critical for two key reasons, researchers said. One is that it allows for high-volume attacks, with amplification rates of up to 15,300 percent of the original byte size.WSD has probes that are used by machines on a LAN to help them discover and configure devices and services. For instance, WSD is how a modern Windows machine automatically finds and configures networked printers. Attackers can use WSD for bad intent by triggering an XML error response from WSD \u2014 which can be done by sending a 29-byte malformed payload, according to Akamai.\u201cIn some cases, an 18 byte payload can be used. The 18 byte probe is 43 percent smaller than the default and 900 percent smaller than the minimal valid probe,\u201d according to the blog post. \u201cWhile the response it triggers is also smaller, it still packs a massive amplification ratio.\u201dWith overflow padding techniques, it\u2019s possible to pad the error response to 2,762 bytes, which results in an amplification factor of 15,300 percent, according to Akamai.\u201cMultiple threat actors have begun to leverage this DDoS method to ramp up their attacks,\u201d Respeto wrote.However, the other reason companies have cause for worry is that WSD is a fairly ubiquitous technology \u2014 found in everything from HP printers since 2008 to Microsoft Windows OSes since Vista to myriad IoT devices. Indeed, a recent report estimated that about 630,000 devices use WSD, leaving plenty of targets at risk.Moreover, WSD is easily exploited due to poor implementation because \u2014 like many LAN-centric technologies that were born before the era of constant connectivity \u2014 WSD was \u201cnever meant to live on the internet,\u201d Respeto wrote.\u201cAs manufacturers pushed out hardware with this service (improperly) implemented, and users deployed this hardware across the internet, they\u2019ve inadvertently introduced a new DDoS reflection vector that has already begun to see abuse,\u201d he wrote.Indeed, while WSD attacks have a high-impact effect, it actually doesn\u2019t take much for attackers to leverage the technique, Respeto warned.\u201cSince UDP is a stateless protocol, requests to the WSD service can be spoofed,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cThis ultimately causes the impacted server, or service, to send responses to the intended victim, consuming large amounts of the target\u2019s bandwidth.\u201dThis situation is a very common DDoS approach, Akamai told Threatpost, which has been observed leading to severe consequences such as those seen with the infamous 2016 cyberattack on DNS provider Dyn, which targeted a number of high-profile Dyn clients, including Twitter, Spotify and GitHub, taking swathes of the internet offline.With bad actors and organizations alike now aware of how WSD can be used to launch DDoS attacks on an unprecedented scale, the question remains what organizations can do to prevent these attacks.According to Akamai\u2019s Respeto, the answer is: not much. \u201cThe only thing we can do now is wait for devices that are meant to have a 10- to 15-year life to die out, and hope that they are replaced with [a] more secured version,\u201d he wrote.In the meantime, with the threat of such attacks looming, Akamai recommends organizations be ready to route traffic to their DDoS mitigation provider in case they\u2019re hit with a WSD-based DDoS attack, the likelihood of which is on the rise.\u201cWe expect that attackers will waste little time in leveraging WSD for use as a reflection vector,\u201d Respeto wrote.UPDATE 11:29 a.m. ET:\u00a0This post previously stated that Akamai researchers said that WSD is the technology exploited in Dyn attack. Threatpost reached out to Akamai to clarify the role of WSD in the Dyn attack and has updated the post accordingly.Interested in the role of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, for both offense and defense?

Troy Mursch with Bad Packets Report confirmed to Threatpost that the DDoS attacks targeting the gaming servers and Wikipedia over the weekend are related.According to third-party service Down Detector, Wikipedia was first impacted on Friday evening for millions of users, who reported issues in Europe, the U.S. and parts of the Middle East. In a press release, the Wikimedia Foundation \u2013 the non-profit owner of the Wikipedia domain \u2013 blamed the takedown, which continued on until Monday morning, on an attack of its servers by \u201cbad actors.\u201d\u201cToday, Wikipedia was hit with a malicious attack that has taken it offline in several countries for intermittent periods,\u201d according Wikimedia\u2019s Saturday statement. \u201cThe attack is ongoing and our Site Reliability Engineering team is working hard to stop it and restore access to the site.\u201dWikipedia has been experiencing intermittent outages today as a result of a malicious attack. We're continuing to work on restoring access. #wikipediadown\u2014 Wikipedia (@Wikipedia) September 7, 2019\u00a0While there has been no follow-up post from Wikimedia on the status of the impacted Wikipedia projects hosted by the affected servers, it appears that as of Monday morning the website was back up and running, with some help from web infrastructure security company Cloudflare.\u201cWe condemn these sorts of attacks,\u201d according to Wikimedia. \u201cThey\u2019re not just about taking Wikipedia offline. Takedown attacks threaten everyone\u2019s fundamental rights to freely access and share information. We in the Wikimedia movement and Foundation are committed to protecting these rights for everyone.\u201dAlso this weekend, DDoS attack hit servers hosted by Blizzard Entertainment, an American video game developer that makes the World of Warcraft games. World of Warcraft Classic for American and European gamers appeared to be specifically impacted starting on Saturday, according to a tweet by Blizzard that acknowledged the incident.\u201cWe are currently monitoring a DDoS attack against network providers which is affecting latency/connections to our games,\u201d the company said in a tweet on Sunday. According to the company, the attack impacted \u201csome online services.\u201dSome online services continue to be impacted by a series of DDoS attacks which are resulting in high latency and disconnections. These disruption effects have been felt by a portion of our players, impacting their gaming experience. Thank you again for your continued patience.\u2014 Blizzard CS \u2013 The Americas (@BlizzardCS) September 7, 2019The attack is reminiscent of a DDoS attack in 2017 of Blizzard Entertainment that created chronic latency and connection issues for players of games Overwatch, World of Warcraft and others.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising [Blizzard Entertainment] haven\u2019t employed proper DDoS mitigation tactics to handle these situations,\u201d Mursch told Threatpost. \u201cSolutions exist at the hardware level\u2026 that could minimize the impact of large-scale DDoS attacks against gaming servers. In Wikipedia\u2019s case, they began using Cloudflare\u2019s services after the attack to prevent further downtime.\u201dMeanwhile on Saturday, operators behind a Twitter account called \u201cUkDrillas\u201d claimed they were behind the Wikipedia and Blizzard DDoS attacks. However, there is no confirmation that the operators of this Twitter account are the culprits. The Twitter account has since been suspended.A new skids band is in town. @UKDrillas claimed they are behind the DDOS attack of Wikipedia. You\u2019ll never learn\u2026 Bragging on Twitter (or elsewhere) is the best way to get caught. I hope you run fast. pic.twitter.com/f97aj6ttwZ\u2014 Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y) September 6, 2019DDoS attacks continue to be a cause of concern for companies.\u00a0 A 2019 Kaspersky report showed that while the sheer number of DDoS attacks are down for the fourth quarter of 2018, the length of time those attacks last have reached record lengths.In an alert on Saturday\u00a0meanwhile, the UK National Cyber Security Centre warned of the Wikipedia DDoS attacks and published guidance for protecting against DDoS attacks: \u201d When a website suffers a DoS attack, it will appear to users that the site has simply stopped displaying content,\u201d it said. \u201cHowever, for businesses it could mean that the online systems they depend upon have ceased to respond.\u201dAccording to that organization, mitigations include: Understanding the points in company services where resources can be overloaded; ensuring that company service providers are ready to deal with DDoS attacks; ensuring that company services can scale to deal with surges in concurrent sessions; and creating an effective response, testing and monitoring plan for dealing with DDoS attacks.Editor's PicksHacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "It\u2019s been roughly two months since Russia first launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the world has borne witness to unspeakable tragedy. While damaged and destroyed property can and will be rebuilt; the death and despair incurred by Ukrainians will leave a lasting imprint across all of Europe for generations to come.As horrific as the physical war has been, the much-anticipated cyberwar hasn\u2019t materialized as quickly as some cybersecurity and national security experts thought it would. In early March, Former General Counsel of the National Security Agency and Central Security Service Glenn S. Gerstell told The Guardian, \u201cwe have not yet seen the completely destructive attacks on Ukraine infrastructure some anticipated.\u201dBut there are new indications that Russia may soon try to intensify its cyberwar. Two weeks ago, Ukraine\u2019s IT infrastructure came under significant assault from Russian hackers. This was the first major attack of real consequence since Russians targeted Ukrainian banks in mid-February.And according to Foreign Affairs, \u201call available evidence indicates that Russia has employed a coordinated cyber-campaign intended to provide its forces with an early advantage during its war in Ukraine.\u201dThreat Landscape Shifts from the Professional to the PersonalWhile the extent of Russia\u2019s digital warfare ambitions remains unknown, much of the world is preparing for the first global cyberwar.In America, President Joe Biden and DHS\u2019s Critical Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) continue to issue detailed cybersecurity warnings to US agencies and businesses alike. Recently, CISA alerted wealth managers that Russian cyberattacks targeting their organizations and their clients are likely. Hospitals, the energy sector, and Fortune 1000s across every industry have also been warned of direct threats and the potential for collateral damage.One attack vector noticeably missing from both government and industry alerts is the personal digital lives of executives \u2013 the C-Suite, Board Members, and senior company leaders \u2013 with direct access to financial, proprietary and confidential information.Recently, skilled cybercriminals and nation states have strategically begun to bypass government and organizational security controls by attacking what CISOs and security teams cannot control: the online privacy, personal devices, and home networks of executives and their families.Vulnerabilities are Vast in Personal Digital LivesBecause enterprise security cannot extend into personal lives, personal device and home network vulnerabilities are plentiful, and often easy to exploit.According to BlackCloak, internal data, 87% of executives\u2019 personal devices lack any cybersecurity controls, and at least 27% of devices contain previously undiscovered malware.Additionally, 75% of personal devices are leaking data due to missing or improperly configured device privacy settings, and 69% of executives have personal and work passwords available on the dark web.These vulnerabilities, among others, represent a green space for cybercriminals and nation-states to breach organizations by hacking executives in their personal lives to subsequently move laterally into the organizations that are their ultimate target.Last month, Google\u2019s Threat Intelligence Group identified Chinese threat actors attempting to hack the personal Gmail accounts of US government workers, according to an article in Bleeping Computer.Protect Executives\u2019 Personal Digital Lives, Protect the OrganizationIt remains to be seen if Russia will escalate its cyberwar, and whether or not an escalation will directly target or indirectly impact US businesses and government agencies. Regardless, security teams must now prepare for lateral attacks manifesting in their executives\u2019 personal digital lives.Fortunately, there are several safeguards that, although burdensome, security teams can help company leaders implement in their personal lives. These include:Ensure that multifactor authentication is active on all personal (including family) devices, apps and systems that allow it. CISOs should block access to all corporate systems from any device in which MFA is not deployed.Submit opt-out requests to as many online data brokers as possible, limiting adversaries ability to obtain the personal information needed to launch social engineering and spear-phishing attacks.Set automatic operating system and firmware updates on all personal devices; and implement home network security via router firewalls and WiFi network encryption to ensure the integrity of communications.Ensure all personal devices, including those of spouses and children, have anti-malware installed and updated.Install WiFi security to protect your home networks and enable home visitors to connect to the guest network.Unfortunately, such safeguards, among others, can take already sacred time and resources to implement, without any guarantees that they will keep individuals or the company safe and secure. But with the drums of cyberwar beating harder and harder, protecting an organization may start and end with how well it can protect executives in their personal digital lives.Cloud SecurityMobile SecurityPrivacySponsoredWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Las Vegas \u2013 Despite bizarre reports of a grasshopper infestation, Black Hat USA 2019 and DEF CON are set to kick off next week in Las Vegas, bringing on a wave of sessions, keynotes and security-themed villages.The Threatpost team, which will be on the frontlines of next week\u2019s shows, discuss what is sticking out to them \u2013 from the keynote given by Dino Dai Zovi\u00a0with Square, \u201cEvery Security Team is a Software Team Now,\u201d to new vulnerabilities disclosed in iPhones, 5G and IoT devices.Listen to Threatpost\u2019s Black Hat USA 2019/ DEF CON preview below (for direct download of the podcast, click here).Below is a lightly-edited transcript of the podcast.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell: Welcome to the Threatpost podcast special Blackhat/DEF CON preview edition. This is the Threatpost team here. I\u2019m Lindsey O\u2019Donnell and I\u2019m joined today with Tom Spring and Tara Seals from Threatpost.Tom Spring: How\u2019s it going?Tara Seals: Hey Lindsey.Lindsey: Good. Just getting ready for Black Hat. Tara and I will be attending Black Hat. And Tom, you will be attending DEF CON this upcoming year. So it\u2019s under a week away, lots to do to prepare.Tom: Yeah, my head\u2019s already spinning. And I\u2019ve seen the videos of the crickets and I\u2019m not too sure how to prepare for the crickets. But at least I know they\u2019re out there, the swarms of crickets that I guess are now descending upon Las Vegas because of the very moist summer so far.Tara: That\u2019s really disturbing. is it located in any sort of general area? Or is it everywhere?Tom: I mean, the videos are just horrendous. I mean, on Twitter, I\u2019ve been seeing videos of like the Luxor, all the massive amounts of crickets flying around the top of the pyramid. And they show pictures of people walking on the streets of Las Vegas, with just the ground cluttered with dead crickets and like thousands of crickets flying around the lightbulbs. It does not look good.Lindsey: Yeah, I guess because the Luxor, which is right near where the conference is, it has that big light shining at the top of it too.Tara: It gains cricket attention.Lindsey: But insects aside, I\u2019m excited for this year\u2019s show. Looking at the Black Hat sessions, the topics covered and the trends that I see will be discussed, it seems different from previous years. And it seems like there\u2019s a lot of new topics and trends that we\u2019ll see; a lot of really interesting stuff there.Tara: Yeah, I agree. I know that I did scan some of the new research that\u2019s going to be presented there. And I thought it was really cool that on the Internet of Things side, there are some new categories of devices that researchers have been probing, like electric motors, for example, which are the things that run robotic arms, or autonomous vehicles. And they\u2019re the things that cause your phone to vibrate when you have it on vibrate instead of ring. So they\u2019re kind of ubiquitous, they\u2019re all over the place. And these things are controlled by hardware and software. And so there\u2019s been some pen testing done and there will be a session on that that seemed cool.Lindsey: I know, last year to there seemed to be a lot more on the IoT side a lot more focused on medical device hacking. I don\u2019t see that as much this year. And I also don\u2019t see as much voice-assistant types of vulnerabilities being discussed, which was huge last year as well. So this year, I see a lot more of what you were saying, Tara, as well as aviation and car hacking and some other interesting applications there.Tom: What do they have for aviation? I know that aviation is something that\u2019s actually a theme that\u2019s going to be in a part of DEF CON. Are there any more specifics around what they\u2019re going to be talking about in terms of presentations or vulnerabilities?Tara: So somebody from IOActive is going to be speaking on how he reverse-engineered the Boeing 787, which is the \u201cDreamliner\u201d as it\u2019s nicknamed, and it\u2019s considered a really advanced aircraft. And so, it\u2019s got a lot of software that controls everything inside of it. And so, he went through and really did a deep dive on the core network that runs everything on board. And he said that he found several vulnerabilities that would allow someone to compromise the security of the network \u2014 maybe in-flight safety mechanisms and things like that. So that\u2019s going to be a really fascinating session. And I agree, Lindsay, that\u2019s\u00a0 a new focus, for sure. And it\u2019s interesting that they\u2019re talking about it at DEF CON too Tom. What are they doing there?Tom: Well, we have an entire Aviation Village. I don\u2019t know much about what\u2019s going to be part of the Aviation Village. There\u2019s a little bit of overlap sometimes with with presenters who also stick around for DEF CON after Black Hat. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we saw some retreads on the aviation front. But they do have an entire village, which is basically a breakout room, big room where they have a number of different themes that are taking place. And aviation is one of them. So I\u2019m really interested in it, especially with the 737 Max and all the attention that\u2019s being placed on airline safety now, and how crucial the software systems are. It will be really interesting to see how that bubbles up at the conference, you know?Lindsey: Yeah, for sure. Actually, I know that today there was just some research released by Rapid7 about how an attacker with physical access to aircrafts could inject false data into an avionics CAN bus and I know that they were going to further detail that at Black Hat or I guess at the DEF CON Aviation Village. So that should be interesting.Then looking at the Black Hat keynote, that that looks like it\u2019ll be pretty exciting as well. Dino Dai Zovi with Square will be talking about the security teams behind services and products, and how they\u2019re becoming increasingly focused on the software side of things. And I think it was titled \u201cEvery Security Team is a Software Team Now.\u201dTara: Yeah, and I think it fits in with this ongoing theme of DevSecOps, and the idea that everything has to be secure by design, especially when you start to move to the cloud, and bring on all of these cloud applications and start developing bespoke software for your enterprise and all that kind of stuff. But he also raises the question in his synopsis on that: So what happens to the classic security teams at that point, if every software team has to have a security component? Do we then still have standalone security teams? Or do they become an ancillary resource that just gets tapped by different divisions? Where do they fit in operationally? And that\u2019s obviously an institutional shift and the mindset shift, so that should be kind of interesting.Google\u2019s Parisa Tabriz at Black Hat 2018Lindsey: \u00a0I\u2019m curious to see what what people have to say in that aspect. And I know at last year\u2019s Black Hat keynote,\u00a0 if you guys remember, was Parisa Tabriz with Google who talked about Google\u2019s efforts for HTTPS, and its Project Zero vulnerability disclosure efforts. So this seems like a very different kind of angle from from last year\u2019s keynote.Tara, were there any sessions that were sticking out on your end at Black Hat this year? I know I saw a couple of really cool ones.Tara:\u00a0 Yeah, there\u2019s more of a focus on wireless in the sense of the networking side of it. So I know that there are a couple of 4G sessions. And then there\u2019s also a 5G session that looked really interesting to me, talking about core vulnerabilities within these networks, these carrier networks, right. But also talking about what that means for end users, and how that can affect end users and companies and their wireless plans and open up new threat vectors and things like that. So I think that\u2019s going to be really interesting. And I didn\u2019t notice that being too much of a focus last year, so that seems like a shift.Lindsey: I feel like that is something that you really covered a lot over the past year or two, right? Didn\u2019t you go to the GSMA Mobile 360 conference a couple of months ago?Tara: Yeah, I went to the May conference on 5G security, and that was really, really fascinating. There\u2019s a leading-edge newly-developing security story around these networks. And it\u2019s also something that a lot of people don\u2019t really think about\u2026it\u2019s kind of a new attack surface. But the consequences can be huge when you think about things like autonomous vehicles and tele-surgery and some of these advanced use cases that 5G is in theory going to be able to support. So if you have a hacker that\u2019s able to disrupt a remote surgery, obviously, that has vast repercussions for human life. So stakes are really high, and it\u2019s pretty interesting area to cover for sure.Tom: Wireless is actually something that we\u2019re going to be hearing a lot at DEF CON. Maybe it\u2019s not so much 5G focused, but they have a couple sessions, \u201chow you can buy your AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint real time data location on the Black Market,\u201d and \u201cGSM, we can hear everyone now\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m on your phone, listening, attacking VoIP configuration interfaces.\u201d Those are just the names of some of the sessions are gonna be taking place at DEF CON, definitely picking up on that wireless theme. And in how \u00a0I think it really it\u2019s it\u2019s such an important topic, considering not only voice data, but mobile communications and and how we\u2019re becoming so much more reliant on these networks for things other than apps and voice.Lindsey:\u00a0 Yeah, for sure. Speaking of mobile, too, it seems like there\u2019s a lot of emphasis on it, similar to last year, on the iPhone. And from a broader level, mobile interconnect threats, how next-gen mobile products are being challenged in the current security landscape. So that\u2019s something to look out for as well. Although that that seems to be a recurring trend from last year.And another thing that really stuck out to me too, like last year, there seems to be a continued narrative this year around social-media threats and security and privacy challenges on social media. I saw an interesting session that\u2019s going to be on the first day of the Black Hat conference called \u201cDetecting Deep Fakes with Mice,\u201d which deep fakes is been increasingly cited on the news over the last year. And that\u2019s essentially when a malicious actor can impersonate any sort of person through like their audio or through photos and use it to sway social media posts and how posts are viewed by people. So that that looks like it\u2019ll be up that alley.And then there\u2019s another session by GoSecure called, \u201cBehind the Scenes, the industry of social media manipulation driven by malware,\u201d which talks about the potential profitability of the social-media malware industry. So there seems to be a lot of emphasis on the top security threats for social media that some of the bigger platforms like Twitter and Facebook are facing and the users of those platforms as well. Like I said, continues the narrative from the last year as well.Tara: Well, and that\u2019s interesting, too, because obviously, the idea of trust in these companies, even though a lot of them are starting to be slapped with fines now, but I think it\u2019s a continued point of interest, right. People want to hear what what they\u2019re doing and what we should be thinking about it.Tom: Well, I mean, we still haven\u2019t solved a lot of the problems that we were introduced to in the last election cycle. So I would say DEF CON is also mirroring some of that concern. Some of the sessions are on social-media manipulation and hacking Congress. And,just trying to continually be focusing on some of \u00a0those same types of topics in terms of being able to leverage these social-media platforms to push an agenda.Tara: And that\u2019s interesting, Tom, I had a question. Last year, when I covered DEF CON last year, and they had a whole Voting Village setup, which was appropriate as the midterms were coming up. Is that a focus this year?Tom: Yeah. So I\u2019m not seeing a lot of stuff regarding elections. And this is my theory, that next year we will be bumping up right up against the 2020 elections \u2014 so we will hear a lot, a lot more about elections. And so this year, it\u2019ll be a theme, it\u2019ll bubble up, but [not like] last year when there was a lot of emphasis on hacking voting machines and registration machines and everything like that.I don\u2019t want to shift gears if we\u2019re still talking about Black Hat, but DEF CON villages are centered around artificial intelligence, and there\u2019s the AppSec Village, talking about application development and security, Aviation Village, and also very much into the DEF CON zone, the Biohacking Village, but I\u2019m not seeing anything straight up on elections and election machines. That\u2019s not to say that it won\u2019t be a theme, just because it\u2019s very prescient right now, in terms of what people are thinking about and talking about.Lindsey: Yeah, I\u2019m kind of surprised that wouldn\u2019t be a bigger focus this year to get ahead of it. But I guess you\u2019re you\u2019re right, because next year, I guess it will much more prevalent in the news and there might be a bigger focus there. And while this doesn\u2019t directly address that, there was one session that I\u2019m looking forward to attending, which is going to be presented by Bruce Schneier, Camille Francois and Eva Galperin, which is \u201cHacking For the Greater Good: Empowering Technologists to Strengthen Digital Society.\u201d So I\u2019d be curious how this will further dive into cybersecurity threats from a human rights perspective, whether it\u2019s like you said, election security or governments using privacy threats against civilians, or whatnot. So and I think it\u2019ll be looking at what public-interest experts can do there and some of the challenges that they\u2019re facing in this current landscape. So I\u2019m curious about that, and whether that might talk about election security, or if it\u2019s going to be a little more broad.Tom: DEF CON 27, their theme is \u201ctechnology\u2019s promise.\u201d That\u2019s just the blurb on the sort of the [DEF CON 27 website] for the conference website and is this year\u2019s theme. The blurb reads: \u201cThis year\u2019s theme, in a way, responds to \u20181983\u2019 with new questions. What does it look like when we make the better choice? What kind of world do we hack together in the sunniest timeline?\u201d I think that\u2019s got to be a reference to George Orwell\u2019s 1984 dystopian world where computers control much of the masses. And then and what I\u2019m inferring from the brief description for DEF CON is that they\u2019re trying to take a look at how we can hack a better world, how we can create the future that we want with these tools, as opposed to being enslaved by Big Brother, so to speak.Tara: So that\u2019s a really interesting theme for a story to write Tom, that can be really fun.Tom: Yeah. It would. You could have some fun with it. Well, we\u2019ll see. They have these themes for the conference, and whether they actually play out, is a different story. But we\u2019ll see what happens. I mean, there\u2019s some really cool sessions: Your sort of bread and butter hardware hacking sessions, software hacking, cloud hacking stuff, taking place at DEF CON, stuff that you would definitely, anticipate really looking forward to. Also a lot of stuff on wireless. And they\u2019ve got a lot of good stuff on breaking Google Home and and just really doing a lot of really interesting things with a lot of the Windows cloud configurations, and I mean, some really fun quirky stuff.Here are a couple of quirky DEF CON sessions: \u201cSay Cheese \u2013 How I Ransomwared your DSLR camera,\u201d \u201cHacking Your Thoughts \u2013 Batman Forever meets Black Mirror,\u201d And \u201cWhy You Should Fear Your Mundane Office Equipment.\u201d I mean, the list really does kind of go on. Oh, \u201cVacuum Cleaning Security: Pinky and the Brain Edition.\u201d And I read the the session details, it\u2019s about how your Roomba \u2014 I don\u2019t know if they name it by brand \u2014 but it\u2019s basically about how your \u00a0electronic vacuum cleaner, your automated little robo-vacuum actually has a lot of sensitive information and and how that can leak out and how that can be hacked.Tara:\u00a0 So I heard something actually not too long ago, somebody had hacked a Roomba. And basically as it moves around your house, someone could use that data to map out the floor plan, to plan a physical robbery or something like that.Tom: Yeah. Yeah, I think that\u2019s where they\u2019re going with this. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I didn\u2019t read the description very closely. And I am just sort of making phone calls and trying to figure out what the best conference what the best sessions to go to are. Lots of lots of fun stuff to choose from. I really, I really enjoy DEF CON a lot. Definitely a different beat, definitely different vibe.Tara:I had one thing for Black Hat that I wanted to just quickly mention, because I thought it was kind of ironic. The CISO for Equifax is going to be giving a talk that\u2019s entitled \u201cOn Trust: Stories From The Frontlines,\u201d which I think is kind of hilarious. I\u2019ll go see what that\u2019s all about.Lindsey: Interesting.Tara: Yeah, I thought so. Obviously, they just got slapped with a $700 million fine for not keeping people\u2019s data secure.Tom: So they have nothing to lose, what else do they have to lose?Tara: Well, they got to get out there and try to rebuild their brand. But you know, I think I\u2019m going to attend just to see how he will position it and what the spin is going to be.Lindsey: Hopefully it\u2019s more of \u201cthings not to do\u201d session.Tom: Right. I wonder how far in advance that was planned.Tara: I think it was on the site before the news of the fine broke.Tom: Yeah, but they knew the fine was coming. It was just how much. But yeah, I mean, they must be just saving face. But I think the interesting thing will be the questions that people have for him at the end of the session.Lindsey: All right, well, definitely looking forward to Black Hat and DEF CON. And yeah, we\u2019ll have \u00a0a lot to be writing about and a lot to discuss. So everyone go to Threatpost.com. We\u2019ll have the latest coverage. We have tons of news that we\u2019re ready to break \u2014 and Tara and Tom, we\u2019ll see you next week the show.Tom: All right. We\u2019ll see you out there with the crickets.Tara: Sounds good.Lindsey: Thanks, guys.Black HatFeaturedIoTMalwareMobile SecurityPodcasts",

        "raw text": "The banking trojan Emotet has returned after a five-month hiatus. But, in an amusing twist, one cyber vigilante is thwarting the malware\u2019s comeback. Researchers say\u00a0a mysterious vigilante is fighting the threat actors behind the malware\u2019s comeback by replacing malicious Emotet payloads with whimsical GIFs and memes.\u201cEmotet was finding default username and password WordPress installs and hosting its payload there. What our vigilante hero is doing is they\u2019re going around finding those WordPress installs where the Emotet payload has been hosted,\u201d Sherrod DeGrippo, senior director of threat research and detection for Proofpoint, told Threatpost. Then, \u201cThey log in with that same username and password that the Emotet did, they delete a payload and they put up a hotlink to GIPHY.\u201dDuring a Black Hat USA 2020 virtual interview this week, DeGrippo talks to Threatpost about Emotet\u2019s resurgence and why the botnet is expanding its partnership with the TrickBot malware to include QakBot \u2013 as well as critical infrastructure, election infrastructure and \u201cpeople\u201d-related phishing threats that you can expect to be discussed at Black Hat USA this week.Listen to the full video interview below or click here.Below find a lightly edited transcript of this interview.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell-Welch: Hi, everyone. This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch with threat post and I am joined today by Sherrod DeGrippo. Sherrod is the senior director of threat research and detection for Proofpoint and she leads a worldwide malware research team that investigates advanced threats including phishing, emails and malware and everything else. So Sherrod, thank you so much for joining me today.Sherrod DeGrippo: It\u2019s good to see you Lindsey, I\u2019m sorry we\u2019re not in person.LO: I know, hopefully next year. Black Hat USA 2020 is this week and one of the main tracks of the show is the malware track. And I know that this year, there\u2019s a ton of discussion around, remote access trojans and malware that\u2019s targeting MacOS. And there\u2019s a really interesting session around Cobalt Strike being used by an APT org operation that\u2019s targeting semiconductor vendors, for instance. So a lot of really cool things that we\u2019re seeing at the show. So I think this gives us a little bit of pretext into looking at some of the top malware trends that we\u2019ve been seeing this past year, and really how those are evolving. So just to start Sherrod, you know, Black Hat USA 2020 is a little different being virtual this year. But is there anything related to malware or other threats that we\u2019re seeing that you\u2019re really looking forward to seeing more discussion about at the show this year?SD:\u00a0I think that in terms of malware I think we\u2019re really interested in seeing how the threat actors are evolving as the network perimeter becomes less and less of an easy target. I think that\u2019s something that \u2013 not to be overly optimistic \u2013 But I do think that the information security industry has been successful in securing our perimeters, securing our technology, securing our systems, the tools are there, the technology is there. If we leverage it and implement it, we\u2019re doing really well. It\u2019s the \u201cpeople\u201d aspects that we continually find is that spot that seems to be where a lot of attackers are able to get in. Leveraging social engineering, they can then you know, launch a lot of attacks at scale, get into places they never could have gotten into before, simply by somebody being tricked into clicking on something. So we do see that still be an issue. And from the malware perspective, you mentioned the semiconductor side of it. Right after Black Hat last year, we detected clear state sponsored activity targeting U.S. hydro electric utility providers, and we\u2019ve written about that extensively on FlowCloud\u00a0and LookBack malware. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m interested in understanding as well. We\u2019re in a new situation where I think everyone really thought all the threat research is going to be around the election. Well, little did we know we have a global pandemic on our hands, that\u2019s leveraging the social engineering side of the pandemic. The election has almost taken a backseat in terms of COVID-19 being so omnipresent. So I\u2019m interested in seeing that, I\u2019m interested in seeing the targeting for critical infrastructure, for election infrastructure \u2026 and\u00a0I want to know what else is out there.LO: That\u2019s such a good point about kind of the emotional side of things too, and the human toll here because as you mentioned, with the pandemic and with the increase of remote workforces and everything else, that\u2019s really creating an evolved threat landscape, particularly from one that\u2019s much different from what we saw in previous years at Black Hat USA and at DEF CON. I think that\u2019s interesting. And, you know, I\u2019m hearing we\u2019re seeing a lot of the same malware and ransomware families that we\u2019ve seen in the past but that the attacks have become much more sophisticated, playing on those emotions of kind of high level of stresses and uncertainty. And attackers are really honing in on current events. Are you seeing that and, what are you really seeing with cyber attacks and how they\u2019re evolving around the pandemic?SD: So I think that\u2019s absolutely right. It\u2019s something that we started seeing at the end of January last year when a lot of the social engineering lures really ended up talking about COVID-19. We saw everything from \u201cyour test results are ready\u201d to \u201cattached in the list of people who have been found positive for the virus that you have interacted with.\u201d All the way to \u201cyour COVID-19 bill is attached.\u201d So we\u2019ve seen really the gamut of leveraging the pandemic as part of social engineering attacks that then come along with the malware. And in terms of the different threat types ransomware the change so much in the way that it operates. We were previously seeing Locky two, three years ago\u00a0in massive volumes, one to 3 million messages a day, a lot of the times, spreading ransomware as an attachment or a link that you would click. What we see a lot more now are these modular flexible downloaders that the threat actors use to get them on a machine. And then they start to understand what that machine is, who\u2019s using it, who the person that owns it might be and then they make a decision of what that next stage payload should be. I think in cases where they determined that other sheen has some sort of high value or is at an organization or a government specifically that will pay. That\u2019s when they deploy the ransomware. Now, they see that as maybe a desktop machine that somebody uses for graphic design or tracking some kind of sales or something not as vital to the business, that\u2019s when they might choose a different next stage payload like a Trojan or it may feel, or like you mentioned remote access Trojans to get other things later.LO: Right. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. Well, I want to ask too, let\u2019s take a step back, and you know, in terms of Emotet, because I know that at Black Hat USA 2019, that was a big point of discussion when we had last talked, and I believe that in 2019, they had gone on this \u201chiatus\u201d and then came back right after Black Hat USA 2019. And now with Black Hat USA 2020 coming up they have also returned after a bit of a five month disappearance. And so talk a little bit about Emotet, how it\u2019s evolved over the past year and how it continues to evolve.SD: Sure. So Emotet is one\u00a0of those classics, I guess we could call it a classic at this point. It\u2019s been around in various stages since 2014, when we started really tracking it at a scale. And in the past year, they have had those breaks, they\u2019ve said they\u2019re going on holiday, and they don\u2019t say that, but you know, they\u2019ve taken that time off, and we don\u2019t know where they go, of course, and they have not done a campaign since February 6 of 2020. And then came back July 17, for 161 days off the landscape in email. The botnet, and the infrastructure was occasionally showing signs of life, but they weren\u2019t inboxing, and inboxing is how they attempt to get their payload onto those machines. \u2026 What we\u2019ve seen is that over the past 10 days or so since July 17, they\u2019ve done a million and a half plus messages over that time span, primarily on Monday through Friday, nine to five for the local geography, and they are widespread. I have never seen them target vertically. I\u2019ve never seen them target a specific type of person or a specific country, they send across the board with each of their campaigns. So US, UK, Canada, but we\u2019ve also seen Brazil, Italy, Spain, United Arab Emirates. They use a pretty generic type of lure. Only in the past couple of days have we seen something that is very interesting, and it\u2019s in fact an old lure. So they\u2019re bringing me back some of the tactics they used before, we haven\u2019t seen a lot of evolution. We did see today, combining malicious Word documents with benign PDFs, probably an attempt to get some kind of evasion for technical controls, or to possibly trick people into clicking, more likely to click because they have two documents they need to review, one being bad, one being good. We also know that Emotet does testing. And so that is why it is one of those threats, that\u2019s watched so closely. They\u2019ll throw out a test before they get into their big campaigns. And so we want to watch really closely what they\u2019re doing. Because if they do those tests, then hopefully we can get ahead of it for the next run that they do for those campaigns.LO: Right. And I\u2019ve been hearing too, that they have been, the Emotet botnet has also been downloading TrickBot and Qakbot, and some of the other ones. Is that what you\u2019re seeing too, and it is that more of the same of what they\u2019ve done in the past or is that different? What are you seeing there?SD: So, you know, in the community that tracks Emotet \u2013 my researchers track it \u2013 We have sort of made jokes in the past that Emotet and TrickBot are best friends. They\u2019re in a monogamous relationship. Emotet dropped TrickBot for so long, so consistently, that we just sort of started to say, \u201coh, Emotet is always going to drop TrickBot.\u201d Well, now that they\u2019re back, it\u2019s doing more of Qakbot. And we\u2019re not seeing any much TrickBot as we were seeing before. I don\u2019t know why that is. Maybe they feel that Qakbot is a little bit more likely to get them the payload results that they want. But essentially, they haven\u2019t been doing the TrickBot like they were before. And they\u2019ve been using kind of the same email lures that they were before. So there isn\u2019t a lot of evolution, which on the one hand seems \u2013 okay, they just came back as they were. But on the other hand, we sort of think, okay, if they didn\u2019t evolve now. When will they evolve? And when will that start?LO: Right, yeah, that\u2019s a that\u2019s a really interesting thing to note too. And I saw too, that there was reports of a vigilante hacker who was sabotaging the operations of the campaign and replacing Emotet payloads with animated GIFs, which I thought was kind of a funny little tidbit there.SD: So,\u00a0yes, that person is our hero. So a lot of people have talked about this because it\u2019s really been around and out there. So basically, the way that they\u2019ve done this is Emotet leverages a lot of WordPress. So WordPress installs tend to be installed. The owner maybe doesn\u2019t change the username and password, they\u2019re left default, or they install some kind of vulnerable plugin. WordPress tends to be relatively insecure. A lot of threat actors use it. In this case, Emotet was finding those default username and password WordPress installs and is hosting the payload there. What our vigilante hero is doing is they\u2019re going around finding those WordPress installs where the Emotet payload has been hosted. They log in with that same username and password that the Emotet did, they delete a payload and they put up a hotlink to GIPHY. And the ones that I\u2019ve seen have been the \u201cWTF guy\u201d from the Blink-182 video and a shot of James Franco from that movie that he did about Kim Jong-Un. So they have a great sense of humor. But what I find really interesting about it is that they\u2019re hotlinking to GIPHY. GIPHY is\u00a0owned by Facebook. Facebook has a very well known well respected security and intelligence team. What this means is that Facebook is now sitting on an incredible amount of telemetry about Emotet for every time that GIF is getting hit on the WordPress site. So if Facebook wants to share that back, I\u2019m sure that people would be more than happy to enjoy the telemetry that Facebook now owns about Emotet.LO: Wow. Yeah, that\u2019s really interesting. I didn\u2019t even think of that. So, we will see there but, I also wanted to ask, do you see Emotet continuing to evolve in some sort of way that may surprise people or what do you think the future is for Emotet in the coming year?SD:\u00a0It\u2019s hard for me to imagine that they\u2019ve lost their innovative spirit. I think that they will continue to evolve, they will continue to do testing and reinforce the things that work and discard the things that don\u2019t, but it\u2019s like anything, we have to sit and see. Ultimately when you\u2019re talking commodity crimeware, the goal of these actors and the goal of these campaigns is to probably make some money. And so they\u2019ll lean toward whatever get some of the best payout.LO: Great. Well, we will definitely be looking out for that the rest of 2020. So, Sherrod, thank you so much for joining me today.SD: Thanks for having me today, Lindsey, always good to see you.LO:\u00a0You as well.

        "raw text": "A popular online social service, Meetup, has fixed several critical flaws in its website. If exploited, the flaws could have enabled attackers to hijack any Meetup \u201cgroup,\u201d access the group\u2019s member details and even redirect Meetup payments to an attacker-owned PayPal account.Meetup is a service with a user base of over 35 million users, used to organize online groups with events for people with similar interests. These events are either for free, or participants can register for a fee using PayPal. While events are typically in person, in light of the ongoing pandemic, many events have moved to virtual settings.\u201cCheckmarx found several \u2018more-common\u2019 API security issues like lack of resources and rate-limiting and excessive data exposure, as well as some serious cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities on Meetup.com that could put users at risk,\u201d said researchers with Checkmarx, in research disclosed Monday at Black Hat USA 2020.[Learn more about the critical Meetup\u00a0flaws \u2013 and other AppSec trends and threats researchers expect to see at Black Hat USA 2020 this year \u2013 in Threatpost\u2019s exclusive\u00a0interview with Checkmarx]Researchers disclosed the issues to Meetup, which has since fixed all the vulnerabilities as of July 15. The flaws were not publicly disclosed by researchers until Monday.\u201cMeetup takes reports about its data security very seriously, and appreciates Checkmarx\u2019s work in bringing these issues to our attention for investigation and follow up,\u201d according to a Meetup statement.The first flaw researchers discovered was stored a cross-site scripting vulnerability on Meetup\u2019s discussion feature, which is activated by default in a Meetup group. The flaw has a CVSS score of 8.7 out of 10, making it high severity.\u00a0The issue is that Meetup does not properly sanitize the discussion field.To exploit the flaw, an attacker simply needs to post a custom script to the Meetup discussion forum.\u00a0This causes a JavaScript popup to occur as soon as any user visits the Meetup page. When the user clicks the popup, an attacker can then carry out various malicious functions, such as stealing their web browsing data (sessions and cookies).\u201cNow, instead of have a message or a discussion or a post on the page, we could have put some benign message actually in the background on a script,\u201d Erez Yalon, the director of security research with Checkmarx, told Threatpost. \u201cSo this by itself is very bad already, because it means that in the context of a web browser, we can do whatever we want. Now for every person who visits this discussion board, so it can be stealing information that is part of your web browsing process like cookies and sessions, and things like that. We can deface the website or even do some cryptomining on the web browser.\u201dCredit: CheckmarxThe attack was made more severe after researchers also found a CSRF glitch on the Payments Received\u00a0 API endpoint of Meetup. \u00a0CSRF means that when an attacker is authenticated on the server they also have control over the client.Researchers were able to chain together the XSS flaw and CSRF glitch, which is the \u201choly grail\u201d for attackers:\u00a0\u201cWhen you manage to, to chain these two together, and sometimes there are no limits to what can actually happen,\u201d said Yalon.That means that if a user with high privileges (like a meetup group \u201cco-organizer\u201d) clicks on the malicious script, attackers could then escalate their privileges to \u201cco-organizer\u201d, hijack a Meetup group page, and completely manage the group. Since the form to change the PayPal recipient\u2019s email address in Settings / Payments received is vulnerable to CSRF, attackers would be also able to change the PayPal email address of every Meetup user to their own PayPal email address, without the victims noticing.Researchers also found several other less serious issues in Meetup, including that the website had a lack of resources and rate-limiting and an Excessive Data Exposure issue.The research was unveiled this week at\u00a0Black Hat USA 2020, which kicked off on Saturday and will focus largely on new security threats, election security, COVID-19 and remote work, and other themes.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

Those sanctions have been levied against the nation and Vladimir Putin\u2019s government due to its invasion of Ukraine.The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued a FinCEN Alert (PDF) on Wednesday advising all financial institutions to remain vigilant against potential efforts to evade the expansive sanctions and other U.S.-imposed restrictions related to the current conflict. One way this may be done is to move cryptocurrency funds through ransomware payments collected after Russian state-sponsored actors carry out cyberattacks.\u201cIn the face of mounting economic pressure on Russia, it is vitally important for U.S. financial institutions to be vigilant about potential Russian sanctions evasion, including by both state actors and oligarchs,\u201d said FinCEN Acting Director Him Das in a press statement.Financial actions taken against Russia by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) since the nation\u2019s invasion of Ukraine last month are numerous. They include:Sanctions against persons who have financial operations in the Russian Federation, including Putin and Russia\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei LavrovProhibitions on correspondent or payable-through account and payment processing and blocking of certain Russian financial institutionsProhibitions related to new debt and equity for certain Russian entitiesA prohibition on transactions involving certain Russian government entities, including the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.FinCEN now is urging financial institutions \u2013 including those with visibility into cryptocurrency or convertible virtual currency (CVC) flows, such as CVC exchangers and administrators \u2013 to identify and report suspicious activity associated with potential sanctions evasion quickly and conduct an investigation where appropriate.So far FinCEN has not seen widespread evasion of sanctions using methods such as cryptocurrency, Das noted. However, \u201cprompt reporting of suspicious activity\u201d can ensure this remains the case to support U.S. efforts and interest in supporting Ukraine.Ramp-Up in Cyber-Attacks Indeed, Russia state-sponsored actors already have ramped up cyber-attacks since the beginning of the conflict in the Ukraine; thus, an increase in ransomware activity is not an entirely unlikely prospect.Researchers at Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) reported earlier this week that they had observed advanced persistent threat (APT) groups affiliated with or backing Vladimir Putin\u2019s government stepping up phishing attacks against Ukrainian and European targets, as well as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against key government and service-oriented Ukrainian websites.Because it is not regulated by typical financial currency laws in the United States, cryptocurrency has become a method of choice for cybercriminals to conduct transactions \u2013 including receiving payouts after ransomware attacks. For this reason, it also could be used by Russia to get around U.S. sanctions, noted one security professional.\u201cFor the tech savvy or oligarch with a need to move money, they can hire the talent to move the transactions,\u201d Rosa Smothers, senior vice president of cyber operations at security firm KnowBe4 and a former CIA cyber threat analyst and technical intelligence officer, observed in an email to Threatpost.However, while cryptocurrency does provide privacy for storage and process transactions, \u201cthe transparency provided by blockchain could make the movement of large amounts of cryptocurrency detectable by law enforcement,\u201d she noted, citing how the Department of Justice was able to seize millions of dollars in Bitcoin that Colonial Pipeline paid to the DarkSide group after a highly disruptive ransomware attack last May.Indeed, another security professional expressed doubt that Russia could use ransomware payments or any other type of cryptocurrency transactions to evade U.S. sanctions \u201cat any meaningful scale.\u201d\u201cThe magnitude of the recent sanction reaches into the billions, amounts that are large enough to be unattainable for almost all cryptocurrencies currently,\u201d observed Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at security firm Cerberus Sentinel. \u201cThere may be opportunities at the individual level, but for the scale of nation-state operations and expenditures, a few million or even tens of millions aren\u2019t really going to move the needle.\u201dLike Smothers, he also noted that the transparency of blockchain technology due to its nature as \u201ca public ledger\u201d makes it easier for financial authorities to observe and trace suspicious cryptocurrency transactions than if sanctioned entities used \u201ctraditional money-laundering means.\u201dRegister Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event sked for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

        "raw text": "Information about nuclear plants and air force capabilities. Conti ransomware gang crooks conjecturing that the National Security Agency (NSA) was maybe behind the mysterious, months-long TrickBot lull. Doxxed data about 120K Russian soldiers.Those are just some of the sensitive, valuable data that\u2019s being hacked out of Russia in the cyber war zone \u2013 a war that erupted even before the country invaded Ukraine.\u201cEveryone is so focused on Russia hacking the world, but the world has been hacking Russia\u2026. And dumping a lot of critical data on military, nuclear plants, etc.,\u201d said Vinny Troia, cybersecurity Ph.D. and founder of ShadowByte, a dark web threat intelligence and cyber fraud investigations firm.He\u2019s one of an untold number of experts on dark-web threat intelligence who\u2019ve been pouring over the intel that\u2019s been flooding out of practically every nook and cranny of the internet: data that\u2019s being posted on Twitter, Telegram and within the multiple dumps of insider knowledge about the Conti ransomware gang posted by the Ukrainian supporter ContiLeaks.(Brought to you by SpecOps. Underwriters of Threatpost podcasts do not assert any editorial control over content.)That ongoing dump, which has included source code for Conti and TrickBot, a decryptor (that doesn\u2019t help recent victims whose files have been encrypted by the Conti gang, unfortunately), and much more, stopped yesterday when the Conti gang shut down its Jabber servers, Troia told Threatpost on Wednesday.He visited the Threatpost podcast to update us on the mountain of data about Russia that intelligence experts are now slogging through.You can download the podcast below or listen here.

My guest today is Vinny Troia, cybersecurity PhD and founder of ShadowByte, a dark web threat intelligence and cyber fraud investigations firm. Today, we\u2019re going to focus on all of the data that\u2019s being leaked on Russia as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.Lisa Vaas: Thanks for coming on the podcast. Vinny, before we jump in, could you give us a bit of your background, please?Vinny Troia: Sure. Thanks for having me. Yes. So my background I come from a DOD background did a lot of work for surface deployment command. And yeah, I was there for about, I think six or seven years before moving over to private sector.Vinny Troia: And while I was there, I did a lot of work in compliance and random security hacking projects, a lot of red teaming, pen testing. And then eventually I started my own firm. Fast forward to today, our focus now is primarily dealing with a lot of ransomware cases, incident response, and we do a lot of ransom negotiations as well.Vinny Troia: We\u2019re constantly focused on dark web threat actors and any of the players, really.Lisa Vaas: Thank you for that. And well this past week must be just a flurry with the dark web activity around Ukraine and Russia. So in an email, you were talking about how everyone is so focused on Russia hacking the world, but the world has been also hacking Russia and dumping a lot of critical data on military nuclear plants, etc.Lisa Vaas: Where is your Intel coming from? Are there any forums in particular that you\u2019re clued into or is that something you can\u2019t even discuss?Vinny Troia: it\u2019s not even like that. It\u2019s a, I mean, it\u2019s literally everywhere. I mean, there\u2019s Telegram channels. I mean, some is just being pasted right on Twitter.Vinny Troia: I mean, it\u2019s literally coming from all angles at this point.Lisa Vaas: Well, tell me what you\u2019re seeing.Vinny Troia: I\u2019d say last month, there was a lot of data coming out about Ukrainian citizens. I mean, a lot. So that was kind of interesting, almost like a precursor to what was happening.Vinny Troia: And now it\u2019s almost like, the rest of the world that\u2019s really pissed and started hacking back and you\u2019re seeing so much data coming out. I\u2019m actually looking for sorry, as we speak, I\u2019m going through some of this data. I mean, there\u2019s stuff on a nuclear plants, some of their air force capabilities.Vinny Troia: There\u2019s another database that I just recently came across that is about a hundred thousand of their military members with photos, passport numbers, things like that. I mean, it\u2019s really just data coming from all depths of. From other infrastructure,Lisa Vaas: well, who, who, who is the primary sources?Lisa Vaas: I mean, I know that anonymous of course has jumped in to, to, to wage war on behalf of Ukraine, cyber war on behalf of Ukraine. And I know that you can put out a call for help from cyber experts on this too. So who, who exactly is, is. Hacking this stuff out of Russia.Vinny Troia: I mean, I, honestly, I couldn\u2019t tell you, I mean, it\u2019s coming, like I said, it\u2019s coming from all sorts of places.Vinny Troia: Right. And\u00a0 when things get leaked, I mean, they just get leaked from various [sources\u2019] usernames on forums or Telegram channels. And so you never really know who it\u2019s coming from. It is interesting that the world kind of banded together against this. And Russia was supposed to have this big cyber arsenal against them.Vinny Troia: And it\u2019s really funny that Joe Biden didn\u2019t mention security once in the state of the union last night, being that it was such a big deal and everybody\u2019s been talking about it.Lisa Vaas: Yeah. And, and I remember it was an NBC news last week or, or was reporting on the big cyberattacks, the major offensive cyberattacks that were being discussed at the White House, but then the White House denied [considering offensive cyberattacks].Vinny Troia: The news has been all about cyberattacks and Russia\u2019s capabilities and it\u2019s such a priority, but it just wasn\u2019t even mentioned once. I just, I find that really strange, but regardless, it\u2019s nice that the world kind of banded together to really come after Russia. One of the most, honestly, just incredibly fascinating things is all these leaks that have been occurring regarding the Conti ransomware. Yes. And they\u2019re arguably the largest or at least one of the top few largest ransomware groups in the world. And I mean, they\u2019re just having everything leak: source code, recovery, keys, chat logs.Vinny Troia: I mean, as early, as recently as today with the most recent chat logs that came out, so somebody still has access to their servers and I haven\u2019t even had a chance to read the ones from today.Lisa Vaas:\u00a0 I just wrote up the second dump and I didn\u2019t even know there was more posted today. It\u2019s so hard to keep up. Can we talk a little bit about those dumps? Now as I understand it, it\u2019s\u00a0 the decryptor for version two of the Conti Lock ransomware software [that was leaked]. That\u2019s not even going to be usable to anybody because it was for an older version.Lisa Vaas: How is this going to affect Conti? Another one of my sources was telling me that just one of the gang\u2019s groups got hit by this [leak] and everybody else is pretty much doing fine. They\u2019re carrying on business as usual.Vinny Troia: I think what\u2019s really interesting. And they talked about this in one of the, in some of the logs. So Conti uses, or used, this one piece of software called TrickBot in order to disseminate\u00a0 and \u2026 one of the or groupings of the chat log showed that the NSA came after TrickBot specifically.Vinny Troia: I don\u2019t know whether or not they reverse engineered or what they did, but I mean, they were able to shut it down for a couple of weeks just by changing patch numbers and uploading them to a server that would accept the changes. And so what they did was they maxed out the maximum patch number.Vinny Troia: The software couldn\u2019t take any new updates at that point. So they effectively shut it down for a little bit. That was actually really amazing.Lisa Vaas: I totally missed that. Which repository was that in? What\u2019s the name of the repository?Vinny Troia:\u00a0 It\u2019s all JSON files.Lisa Vaas: Everybody knew that TrickBot pretty much shut down for a few months, but I didn\u2019t know that about the NSA piece.Vinny Troia: It\u2019s presumed to be the NSA, given the level of skill that was involved, we\u2019ll call it finesse. I would say it would have to be some government agency.Lisa Vaas: Was there chatter about the shutdown?Vinny Troia: Yeah, it\u2019s basically a handful of officials talking about it and how they were shut down and how they basically had to rebuild their infrastructure.Vinny Troia: They were down for a little bit and eventually they came back, but it just shows that\u00a0 they were being targeted by nation states. I think the most interesting thing is,\u00a0 if this really is a Russian operated group, which is what it seems like, then the fact that all these files are being leaked, whether it\u2019s from an insider or somebody who\u2019s a researcher who\u2019s attacking them specifically, I think this is going to have a major toll on Russia\u2019s finances, especially considering this is a group that is averaging what, a couple hundred million dollars a year recurring revenue?Lisa Vaas: I don\u2019t expect you to know this, but maybe you do: How much of Russia\u2019s economy is actually coming from ransomware or other malware?Vinny Troia: I think the majority, actually. So I think the majority of Russia\u2019s economy is coming from some sort of crime. There\u2019s not a whole lot going on over there. It\u2019s like a big wasteland,Lisa Vaas: Right. The underground members say \u201cprotect the motherland, the motherland protects you. \u201cExcept for when they need some stooges to arrest, some low-level stooges to make the U.S. happy, which happened recently.Vinny Troia: As far as the decryptor [goes], you\u2019re correct. It is for an older version. I think I saw some keys floating around as well, but new code is written on top of old code and it\u2019s not like it was replaced completely. So I would imagine that there will be some fallout from that code base.Lisa Vaas: Yeah,\u00a0there\u2019s a lot of code to go through. I hear. So what were some other really great finds\u00a0 in the intelligence that we\u2019re getting out of Russia during this crisis?Vinny Troia: It\u2019s information on citizens, it\u2019s information on military members. I\u2019ve seen things on nuclear plants. I can\u2019t speak to what can be done with all of it, honestly, but the point is it\u2019s there and, in the right hands, I\u2019m sure it could be pretty useful.Lisa Vaas: I assume, during these days, it\u2019s just not going to let up.Vinny Troia: No, and like I said, a couple of hours ago we had more leaks from their Jabber server. So I would imagine whoever has access has been able to pull off a lot, and I think [Conti] actually just shut it down finally.Lisa Vaas: So that means they they shut down Jabber. That doesn\u2019t mean that they figured out who the leaker is. Right?Vinny Troia: The person leaking it goes by [ContiLeaks]. But whether or not he\u2019s the one with access, I don\u2019t know. But the point is they figured out that somebody did have access to their Jabber logs. So now they\u2019ve moved servers.Lisa Vaas: Well, awesome. What else can you tell listeners? What can you leave us with?Vinny Troia: I would say that, just because Conti\u2019s out doesn\u2019t mean that the problem is going away anytime soon. So be diligent and keep up with your passwords and make sure that you actually have fresh passwords, because looking at these logs and how they\u2019re getting into a lot of these systems, it\u2019s just using other people\u2019s recycled passwords.Vinny Troia: The hacks they\u2019re using aren\u2019t even that sophisticated. And I mean, even now the majority of hacks are still caused by reused passwords.Lisa Vaas: We can get some intelligence out of the exploits that they\u2019re targeting. I think I saw Zerologin was mentioned as one, and of course\u00a0 we know a lot about their tooling right now. Like the whole Cobalt Strike beacon thing.Vinny Troia: Cobalt Strike\u2019s been a red teaming tool forever. It\u2019s a staple. For pen testers, it\u2019s an amazing tool. And so the fact that they were using it isn\u2019t really a surprise.Lisa Vaas: Well, is there anything surprising that was found in the dumps? I know that we\u2019ve got\u00a0 email addresses of some of the members of the gang.Vinny Troia: You can use that to look for other accounts and potentially start to reverse back to maybe who they are. But I mean, there\u2019s so much information here. I haven\u2019t even gone through maybe a 10th of it. It\u2019s coming up too fast. It\u2019s a full-time job. It takes a full-time team at this point to go through all of this. Because then there was another thing that came out: rocket chat logs from a rocket chat. There\u2019s thousands of logs here.Lisa Vaas: Yeah, that\u2019s pretty bad. When you\u2019ve got a researcher, an intel expert who says he\u2019s getting too much: The firehouse is open so wide. So the takeaways for listeners\u00a0 are that these leaks haven\u2019t stopped, and we don\u2019t even know how many that [ContiLeaks] is promising.Vinny Troia: I mean, the fact that today\u2019s leaks caused the shutdown, I presume caused a shut down of their Jabber server. I\u2019m going to say that well has pretty much run dry. I don\u2019t know what else is going to be released in terms of tools, but I\u2019d say all of this has probably put a dent in everything they\u2019re doing for a little bit.Lisa Vaas: We can hope so, but I don\u2019t think we should assume anything. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re telling us: They\u2019re still going to be active and they\u2019re going to retool anyway. Right. And will resurface.Vinny Troia: Yeah. I was going to say,\u00a0 giving credit to [security journalist Brian] Krebs on this one, one of the things he reported on was that there was a conversation, and I haven\u2019t even made it to the set about how the ransomware groups were being investigated.Vinny Troia: And someone high up in the group basically told them they didn\u2019t have anything to worry about. The investigation was going to go off of them. And that was right around the time that Russia took down REvil. So it was interesting. It\u2019s almost like they had insider information, or maybe they literally were working for [Russia].Lisa Vaas:\u00a0 I think REvil. that takedown, was the one I was thinking about when I alluded to this kind of\u00a0 token law enforcement action on Russia\u2019s part to maybe make the U.S. shut up.\u00a0Now I have to go read Brian Krebs. Why didn\u2019t I read Brian Krebs earlier today? I have to do that. That\u2019s like a requirement of the job. OK, well, Vinnie, unless you\u2019ve got anything else to add, I\u2019m going to let you go.Vinny Troia: No, all good.Lisa Vaas: I appreciate it. Thank you so much.

        "raw text": "In the wake of cyberattacks targeting the recently held German elections, the European Union has blamed Russia for an ongoing disinformation campaign called \u201cGhostwriter.\u201d Germany is the latest target in an effort that for years has tried to discredit NATO, and which has both smeared and cyberattacked Parliament members, other politicians and government officials, and journalists.It\u2019s not the first time the campaign has been attributed to Russia, but on Friday, the EU Council made the link official. From the press release:\u201cThese malicious cyber-activities are targeting numerous members of Parliaments, government officials, politicians, and members of the press and civil society in the EU by accessing computer systems and personal accounts and stealing data.\u201cSuch activities are unacceptable as they seek to threaten our integrity and security, democratic values and principles, and the core functioning of our democracies.\u201d \u2014EU Council\u2019s Sept. 24 press release.The Council noted that the actions attributed to Ghostwriter operators \u2013 actions that have included attempts to steal login credentials of German lawmakers to pull off identity theft before the Sept. 26 federal election, as well as a spearphishing attack that targeted multiple German Parliament members \u2013 run counter to what\u2019s expected from a responsible state:\u201cThese activities are contrary to the norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace as endorsed by all UN Member States, and attempt to undermine our democratic institutions and processes, including by enabling disinformation and information manipulation,\u201d according to the press release.\u201cThe European Union and its Member States strongly denounce these malicious cyber-activities, which all involved must put to an end immediately,\u201d the release continued. \u201cWe urge the Russian Federation to adhere to the norms of responsible state behavior in cyberspace.\u201dGhostwriter\u2019s HistoryIn July 2020, FireEye\u2019s Mandiant threat-intelligence analysts reported that they\u2019d uncovered a widespread influence campaign that was aiming to discredit NATO, the intergovernmental military alliance between 30 North American and European countries.At the time, FireEye reported that the campaign had been ongoing since at least March 2017. It wasn\u2019t just about spreading fake news on social-media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, as other disinformation campaigns have done. Rather, the Ghostwriter threat actors went a step beyond, compromising news website content management systems (CMSes) and spoofing email accounts to spread cooked-up content, including fake correspondence from military officials and bogus quotes from political figures.Earlier this month, German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Andrea Sasse said that Ghostwriter has targeted the German parliament at least three times this year, \u201ccombining conventional cyberattacks with disinformation and influence operations.\u201d Sasse added that activities targeting Germany have been observed \u201cfor some time.\u201dSasse also said that ahead of Germany\u2019s federal election on Sept. 26, Ghostwriter threat actors tried to steal login credentials of federal and state lawmakers so as to pull off identity theft.Tied to Russia\u2019s GRU Military IntelSasse said that the German government has \u201creliable information\u201d that\u2019s led it to conclude that Ghostwriter\u2019s activities are tied \u201cto cyber-actors of the Russian state and, specifically, Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence service,\u201d referring to the General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) arm of Russia\u2019s military intelligence.As far as the spearphishing attack goes, Der Spigel reported in March that personal email accounts belonging to seven members of the Bundestag (the German federal parliament) and 31 members of the state parliament were targeted. The lure: fake news about desecration of a Jewish cemetery.The next month, in April, FireEye updated its original Ghostwriter report to add that the group had expanded its narratives; targeting; and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP). Researchers said that recent operations had \u201cheavily leveraged\u201d compromised social-media accounts of right-wing Polish officials in order to \u201cpublish content seemingly intended to create domestic political disruption in Poland, rather than foment distrust of NATO.\u201dAt the time, as FireEye explained, Ghostwriter operators appeared to have moved past using compromised websites and spoofed emails or posts from fake people. Instead, the threat actors apparently were using account credentials stolen from targets\u2019 compromised email accounts.The EU Council concluded its release by saying that it\u2019s going to revisit the Ghostwriter issue in future meetings and may consider taking further steps against Russia.Rule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

Fancy Bear or Strontium, among other names \u2013 has been using a Kubernetes cluster in a widespread campaign of brute-force password-spraying attacks against hundreds of government and private sector targets worldwide.The joint alert (PDF) \u2013 posted on Thursday by the National Security Agency (NSA), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the FBI, and the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) \u2013 attributes the campaign to the APT group, which has long been suspected of having ties to the General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) arm of Russia\u2019s military intelligence.The attacks have been launched since at least mid-2019 through early 2021 and are \u201calmost certainly still ongoing,\u201d according to the advisory.The threat actor has targeted \u201ca significant amount\u201d of its activity at organizations using Microsoft Office 365 cloud services, authorities warned.\u00a0The attackers are after the passwords of people who work at sensitive jobs in hundreds of organizations worldwide, including government and military agencies in the U.S. and Europe, defense contractors, think tanks, law firms, media outlets, universities and more.APT28 targets being bombarded by brute-force attacks. Source: CISA advisory.Once the threat actors get valid credentials, they\u2019re using them for initial access, persistence, privilege escalation and defense evasion, among other things.

Both these and other vulnerabilities can be used for remote code execution (RCE) and further access to target networks.After APT28 gains remote access, it uses a slew of well-known tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) \u2013 including HTTP(S), IMAP(S), POP3, and NTLM (a suite of Microsoft security protocols used for authentication \u2013 in addition to Kubernetes-powered password-spraying in order to gain lateral movement, to evade defenses and to sniff out more information from the target networks.Example of several TTPs used together as part of this type of brute-force campaign. Source: CISA advisory.Given how vastly different the target networks\u2019 structures are, the actors are using an equally diverse mix of TTPs. The alert included 21 samples of known TTPs. One example is the TTPs used to exploit public-facing apps: APT28 has been tracked using the two previously mentioned bugs to gain privileged RCE on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers, which in some case happened after valid credentials were identified via password spray, given that exploitation of the vulnerabilities requires authentication as a valid user.How Kubernetes Fits InAuthorities said that to obfuscate its true origin and to provide \u201ca degree of anonymity,\u201d the Kubernetes cluster used in these attacks normally routes brute-force authentication attempts through Tor and commercial VPN services, including CactusVPN, IPVanish, NordVPN, ProtonVPN, Surfshark and WorldVPN. If they\u2019re not using Tor or a VPN, the actors are sometimes using nodes in the Kubernetes cluster.Given the \u201cscalable nature of the password spray-capability,\u201d specific indicators of compromise (IOC) can be easily altered to bypass IOC-based mitigation, the advisory explained. Thus, while the advisory lists specific indicators, authorities also advised organizations to consider denying all inbound traffic from known Tor nodes and public VPN services to Exchange servers or portals that don\u2019t normally see that kind of access.MitigationsBeyond authorities\u2019 suggestion to consider shutting off the spigot on Tor and VPN services where that makes sense, the advisory also listed a number of standard and not-so-standard mitigations, summed up in an executive summary:\u201cNetwork managers should adopt and expand usage of multi-factor authentication to help counter the effectiveness of this capability. Additional mitigations to ensure strong access controls include time-out and lock-out features, the mandatory use of strong passwords, implementation of a Zero Trust security model that uses additional attributes when determining access, and analytics to detect anomalous accesses.\u201dBut one expert \u2013 Tom (TJ) Jermoluk, CEO and co-founder of Beyond Identity, raised a hairy eyeball at the notion that stronger passwords can do anything to protect against password spraying, particularly when it comes on top of a concerted effort to gather valid credentials.\u201cRussian GRU agents and other state actors like those involved in SolarWinds \u2013 and a range of financially motivated attackers (e.g., ransomware) \u2013 all use the same \u2018password spraying\u2019 brute force techniques,\u201d he told Threatpost in an email on Friday. \u201cWhy? Because they are so effective. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding of this technique is leading to shockingly flawed advice like that given in the NSA advisory which, in part, recommends \u2018mandating the use of stronger passwords.'\u201dHe added, \u201cThe credential-gathering that preceded the password spraying campaign most certainly collected short and strong passwords. And the Russian Kubernetes cluster used in the attack was capable of spraying \u2018strong passwords.'\u201dThe Continuing ThreatOn Friday, Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington issued a statement on Facebook in which it \u201ccategorically\u201d rejected the allegations, noting that \u201cWe emphasize that fighting against cybercrime is an inherent priority for Russia and an integral part of its state policy to combat all forms of crime.\u201dJust a few of the recent campaigns attributed to Russia\u2019s military unit:April 2021: The NSA linked APT29 to Russia\u2019s Foreign Intelligence Services (SVR), as the U.S. formally attributed the recent SolarWinds supply-chain attacks to the SVR and issued sanctions on Russia for cyberattacks and what President Biden called out as interference with U.S. elections.November 2020: Microsoft reported that APT28 joined in the feeding frenzy as one of three major APTs that went after pharma and clinical organizations involved in COVID-19 research.September 2020: Microsoft issued a warning that members of the Russian military unit were attempting to harvest Office 365 credentials in the runup to U.S. elections, targeting mainly election-related organizations. The company noted at the time that the group had attacked more than 200 organizations last year, including political campaigns, advocacy groups, parties and political consultants. Those targets included think-tanks such as The German Marshall Fund of the United States, The European People\u2019s Party, and various U.S.-based consultants serving Republicans and Democrats.Saying that we can\u2019t let down our guards would be quite the understatement, according to Check Point spokesperson Ekram Ahmed: \u201cGRU continues to be a threat that we can\u2019t ignore,\u201d he observed to Threatpost on Friday. \u201cThe scale, reach and pace of their operations are alarming, especially with the 2021 Summer Olympics around the corner.\u201dIn fact, in October 2020, the U.K.\u2019s NCSC, in a joint operation with U.S. intelligence, said that that\u2019s exactly what was in the works, accusing Russian military intelligence services of planning a cyberattack on the Japanese-hosted Olympics, scheduled to start in three weeks on July 23 after having been postponed due to the pandemic.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Cloud SecurityGovernmentMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The U.S. government has identified Russia as the \u201clikely\u201d culprit behind the widespread SolarWinds cyberattack that has so far affected multiple federal agencies and private-sector companies. Cyberespionage is cited as the motivation behind the attack, which the feds characterized as ongoing.In a rare joint statement by the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the National Security Agency (NSA), the agencies said a task force assigned to investigate the incident has found indications that Russia was behind the attack, something many government officials and security experts had already suspected.\u201cThis work indicates that an advanced persistent threat (APT) actor, likely Russian in origin, is responsible for most or all of the recently discovered, ongoing cyber compromises of both government and non-governmental networks,\u201d according to the statement, which did not provide the technical details behind the attribution. \u201cAt this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort.\u201dThe Departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Treasury and Commerce, the Pentagon, the National Institute of Health and others are known to have been attacked, along with Microsoft.\u201cThe Cold War isn\u2019t over. It just moved to the internet,\u201d said Saryu Nayyar, CEO at Gurucul, via email. \u201cAnd the SolarWinds attack is a perfect example of a state or state-sponsored actor turning their resources to cyberattack. Unlike typical cybercriminals, these threats at this level have almost unlimited resources and will target virtually anything that may forward their agenda.\u201dShe added, \u201cIt is likely the damage from this attack will run much deeper than is revealed to the public, but it may serve as a wakeup call that organizations and vendors at all levels need to up their cybersecurity game. They need to assess their current security posture and make sure they have the best possible components in place, including security analytics. The benefit is that designing defenses to blunt state-level attackers should be more than enough to thwart common cybercriminals.\u201dSolarWinds: A Supply-Chain NightmareSunburst, a.k.a. Solorigate, is the malware used as the tip of the spear in the supply-chain campaign, in which adversaries\u00a0were able to use SolarWinds\u2019 Orion network management platform\u00a0to infect targets. It was pushed out via trojanized product updates to almost 18,000 organizations around the globe, starting last March. With Sunburst embedded, the attackers have since been able to pick and choose which organizations to further penetrate and steal information from.The government\u2019s Cyber Unified Coordination Group (UCG) responsible for following up on the attack \u201cis still working to understand the scope of the incident\u201d and is taking the \u201cnecessary steps\u201d to \u201crespond accordingly,\u201d the agencies said, while \u201cworking to identify and notify the nongovernment entities who also may be impacted.\u201dThe first indications of the attack happened in early December, when cybersecurity firm FireEye was hit with a highly targeted cyberattack that stole the company\u2019s red teams assessment tools used to test its customers\u2019 security.Several days later, the DHS and the Treasury and Commerce department were the first of the government agencies to identify an attack related to the FireEye compromise that was pinned at the time on unidentified foreign adversaries. The scope of the effort continued to widen as more and more victims\u2014including tech giant Microsoft, other federal agencies and related government contractors\u2013were found to be affected.Eventually, it was discovered that an attack vector leveraging the default password (\u201cSolarWinds123\u201d) of the SolarWinds platform gave attackers an open door into its software-updating mechanism. Combining that with SolarWinds\u2019 deep visibility into customer networks became a \u201cperfect storm\u201d contributing to the widespread success of the attack, researchers said.Indeed, federal agencies acknowledged that given the scope of the compromise, the effort to investigate and remediate the damage down will be a \u201csustained and dedicated effort\u201d of both public and private security professionals across the country.As for the ongoing investigation and response to the attack, the statement noted that the FBI is leading threat response; CISA is leading the asset response; and the ODNI is the lead for intelligence support and related activities. Meanwhile, the NSA is supporting the UCG by providing intelligence, cybersecurity expertise and actionable guidance, according to the statement.\u201cThe UCG remains focused on ensuring that victims are identified and able to remediate their systems, and that evidence is preserved and collected,\u201d as well as will provide updates to the investigation as they are available, the agencies said.SolarWinds meanwhile is facing a class-action lawsuit from its investors over the financial fallout for the company stemming from the attack and its poor cybersecurity posture in using an easy-to-guess default password.Related coverage:Sunburst\u2019s C2 Secrets Reveal Second-Stage SolarWinds VictimsMicrosoft Caught Up in SolarWinds Spy Effort, Joining Federal AgenciesNuclear Weapons Agency Hacked in Widening CyberattackThe SolarWinds Perfect Storm: Default Password, Access Sales and MoreDHS Among Those Hit in Sophisticated Cyberattack by Foreign AdversariesFireEye Cyberattack Compromises Red-Team Security ToolsDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "As the May elections for European Parliament loom, Russia-linked APT groups are amping up their efforts to target journalists, think-tanks, non-governmental organizations and other members of civil society, according to Microsoft.The tech giant said on Tuesday that it has observed a recent series of attacks on organizations \u201cworking on topics related to democracy, electoral integrity and public policy and that are often in contact with government officials,\u201d including campaigns targeting employees of the German Council on Foreign Relations, The Aspen Institutes in Europe and The German Marshall Fund.\u201cEverything we do as an organization, from our policy research to our work strengthening civil society, is dedicated to advancing and protecting democratic values,\u201d The German Marshall Fund said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cThe announcement serves as a reminder that the assault on these values is real and relentless.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Digital Crimes Unit (DCU) observed hacking efforts in the last quarter of 2018 targeting 104 accounts belonging to organization employees located in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Romania and Serbia. According to Microsoft executive Tom Burt, \u201cwe are confident that many of [the attacks] originated from a group we call Strontium.\u201dStrontium, a.k.a. APT 28, Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sednit or Sofacy,, is known for hacking the Democratic National Committee and other targets during the 2016 presidential election in the U.S.; for hacking and disinformation attacks during the French and German presidential elections in 2017; hacking Republican think-tanks and spreading fake social media sites leading up to the U.S. midterm elections in 2018; and a range of other espionage and influence campaigns related to sowing chaos and discord into democratic processes.European leaders have recently warned that such attacks will continue across Europe in 2019, particularly as hundreds of millions of E.U. citizens prepare to head to the polls to select a new Parliament (something that happens once every five years); and ahead of several key national elections, including in Belgium, Finland, Ireland and Spain.\u201cThere is no doubt that Russia will be a major malign actor,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told POLITICO at the Munich Security Conference last week, warning that doctored videos and audio recordings will likely be a key tactic used to spread disinformation.He added that it\u2019s possible that other APT groups, including from China or Iran, are taking pages from the Fancy Bear playbook: \u201cIt\u2019s not an ideological war from Russia, it\u2019s not a left-wing or right-wing oriented campaign, but the campaign aims at undermining trust and confidence and initiates chaos and instability.\u201dFor its part, Microsoft has seen European-targeting APT efforts being aimed at espionage. \u201cConsistent with campaigns against similar U.S.-based institutions, attackers in most cases create malicious URLs and spoofed email addresses that look legitimate. These spearphishing campaigns aim to gain access to employee credentials and deliver malware,\u201d Burt noted in the blog post. \u201cThe attacks we\u2019ve seen recently, coupled with others we discussed last year, suggest an ongoing effort to target democratic organizations. They validate the warnings from European leaders about the threat level we should expect to see in Europe this year.\u201dRussian officials have denied that Moscow had any role in the hacking attempts.According to CrowdStrike\u2019s 2019 Global Threat Report, Russian-speaking APTs continue to make strides in terms of their effectiveness. Groups like Fancy Bear for instance have an average \u201cbreakout\u201d time of just over 18 minutes to go from initial compromise to the attacker\u2019s first lateral movement within the network. That\u2019s almost eight times faster than second-ranked North Korea-linked threats (Lazarus Group/Chollima, for instance), which had a collective average time of two hours and 20 minutes.Overall, Crowdstrike expects nation-state activity to ramp up in 2019.\u201cIn 2019, targeted intrusion adversaries will continue to conduct campaigns as part of their nation-state\u2019s national strategies,\u201d according to the report. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran and the DPRK are seeking geopolitical prominence, both in their respective regions and internationally, and they will use their cyber-capabilities to attain and maintain situational awareness of their neighbors and rivals. Entities in the government, defense, think tank and NGO sectors will continue to be the targets of these operations. These intrusions will likely be supported by the targeting of upstream providers in the telecommunications and technology (particularly managed service providers) sectors, and may include supply-chain compromises.\u201dTom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer for Carbon Black and global fellow for Cyber Policy at the Wilson Center, said in a media statement that think-tanks in particular are attractive targets for the politically minded.\u201cThink-tanks are considered the ivory towers of policymakers, as their boards often comprise CEOs and former politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cAdditionally, most public policy issues are researched and corresponding strategies are developed by think tanks. There are only a handful of non-partisan think tanks. As the Global Fellow for Cyber Policy at the Wilson Center, I\u2019ve found that, for years, the Russians and Chinese have not only hacked think tanks but they have turned them into watering holes to pollute those who download their reports. Putin\u2019s bellicose speech stated he would no longer knock on doors that were shut, which served as a warning that was preceded by cyber-intrusions targeting European and American think tanks and politicians.\u201dCritical InfrastructureGovernmentHacksMalwarePrivacy",

        "raw text": "The Zebrocy trojan \u2013 a custom downloader malware used by Russia-linked APT Sofacy (a.k.a. APT28, Fancy Bear or Sednit) \u2013 has a new variant. While it\u2019s functionally much the same as its other versions, the new code was written using the Go programming language.The similarities between the new payload and previous Zebrocy variants start with the fact that the versions share the same command-and-control (C2) URL, according to an analysis from Palo Alto\u2019s Unit 42 group. Beyond that, additional overlaps include the fact that it does initial data collection on the compromised system, exfiltrates this information to the C2 server and attempts to download, install and execute an additional payload from the C2.It also uses ASCII hexadecimal obfuscation of strings, a volume serial number without a hyphen obtained from the VOL command, uses the output from \u201csysteminfo\u201d and \u201ctasklist\u201d in the outbound C2 beacon, and uses the string \u201cPrgStart\u201d within the C2 beacon, according to Unit 42 analysis.\u201cPast Zebrocy variants have been developed in AutoIt, Delphi, VB.NET, C# and Visual C++,\u201d said developers at Unit 42, in a posting on Tuesday. \u201cWhile we cannot be certain of the impetus for this, we believe the threat group uses multiple languages to create their trojans to make them differ structurally and visually to make detection more difficult.\u201dFresh APT AttacksUnit 42 has so far seen two attacks delivering the Go variant of Zebrocy: One on October 11, and again on Dec. 5 in an attack that seems to be linked to a previously analyzed campaign (the \u201cDear Joohn\u201d campaign) that ran from mid-October to mid-November.The first was a spear-phishing email with an LNK shortcut attachment that was meant to rely on PowerShell scripts; the scripts however were incorrectly coded so the payload couldn\u2019t execute.The second used a delivery document that had an author name of Joohn, which is how Unit 42 clustered the Dear Joohn delivery documents for that campaign. There, the APT targeted several government entities around the globe, including in North America, Europe and a former Soviet state, and it came in waves during late October and early November. It was seen spreading a brand-new trojan dubbed Cannon.Now, the tactics seem to have evolved to use the new Zebrocy variant.\u201cLike the Dear Joohn attacks, the delivery document downloads a remote template via HTTP,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cUpon opening the delivery document, the lure image \u2026 attempts to trick the recipient into enabling content to run the macro within the downloaded remote template.\u201dThat macro is similar to the one used in other Dear Joohn samples, except that it extracts a ZIP from the remote template that contains the Zebrocy executable, which in turn fetches a secondary payload (another downloader) from the C2.\u201cThe Sofacy group continues to use variants of the Zebrocy payload in its attack campaigns,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThe adversaries made some drastic errors to the delivery LNK shortcut, which made this attack seemingly ineffective. Regardless \u2026 It is also apparent that the Sofacy group will use these new variants of Zebrocy across multiple different campaigns, as the Go variant of Zebrocy was delivered via the LNK shortcut and a Dear Joohn delivery document.\u201dMalware",

        "raw text": "A rift has formed in the cybercrime underground: one that could strengthen, rather than cripple, the cyber-onslaught of ransomware.According to a report (PDF) published Monday, ever since the outbreak of war in Ukraine, \u201cpreviously coexisting, financially motivated threat actors divided along ideological factions.\u201d\u201cPro-Ukrainian actors are refusing to sell, buy, or collaborate with Russian-aligned actors, and are increasingly attempting to target Russian entities in support of Ukraine,\u201d wrote researchers from Accenture\u2019s Cyber Threat Intelligence (ACTI). \u201cHowever, pro-Russian actors are increasingly aligning with hacktivist-like activity targeting \u2018enemies of Russia,\u2019 especially Western entities due to their claims of Western warmongering.\u201d\nWhat might otherwise seem like a good thing \u2013 bad guys fighting bad guys \u2013 may in fact pose an increased threat to the West.The Russia-Ukraine Cyber WarzoneHistorically, the world\u2019s foremost cybercrime forums have been Russian language. These dark web marketplaces bring together a complex network of advanced persistent threat (APT) and ransomware groups, botmasters, and malware authors \u2013 a range of cybercriminals that includes even low-level carders, scammers and script kiddies.Together, threat actors can do more than they otherwise could on their own. For example, botmasters offer access to already compromised devices, software developers improve the malware, and initial access brokers specialize in providing network access via backdoors or security vulnerability exploits for things like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).This productivity is underpinned by not only a shared language, but a shared cultural and political alignment. As ACTI noted in its report, \u201cthese forums previously employed a strict, \u2018no work in CIS\u2019 policy.\u201d The CIS \u2013 Commonwealth of Independent States \u2013 is a post-Soviet conglomeration of Russia and central Asian states.With the outbreak of war, however, this harmony is fracturing.One poll, published to a cross-site scripting (XSS) forum on March 2, posed the question: \u201cAre you against work on RU and CIS?\u201d 82.6 percent of respondents responded \u201cYes,\u201d but, a surprisingly large minority \u2013 17.4 percent \u2013 responded \u201cNo.\u201dNo Love For MoscowOn Feb. 27, an admin from RaidForums \u2013 an online marketplace for trafficking data from high-profile database leaks \u2013 published a statement titled \u201cRAIDFORUMS SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA.\u201dANY USER FOUND TO BE CONNECTING FROM RUSSIA WILL BE BANNED! THIS IS NOT A JOKE, WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE KREMLIN.Shortly after the statement was published, RaidForums\u2019 main server was taken down by unknown enemies. It remained down as of March 4, according to ACTI.The same is true in the opposite direction. The conflict \u201chas led some actors to exclusively sell their services, such as network accesses, to pro-Russian actors,\u201d researchers wrote, and inspired increased attacks against Western targets.How This Will Hurt the WestIt might appear, at first glance, that civil war in the cyber underground is a good thing. After all, if they\u2019re fighting each other they won\u2019t have time to annoy the rest of us, right?In fact, the exact opposite is true.\u201cThe primary effect of this political divide so far,\u201d the researchers observed, \u201cis an increased and prolonged threat from underground actors aimed at Western targets, owed to the galvanization of pro-Russian actors and their targeted efforts that focus on \u2018enemies of Russia.'\u201dNationalist fervor is even motivating cybercriminals to open their arms and welcome previously shunned ransomware groups.In response to the Colonial Pipeline attack last May, Western governments and law enforcement began cracking down harder than ever on ransomware groups. In response \u2013 to avoid getting the stink on them, too \u2013 underground admins banned those groups.\u201cWhile ransomware actors did not disappear from the underground,\u201d wrote the researchers, \u201cthe ban did make it harder for them to acquire tools, recruit affiliates, or gain exploits or accesses, thereby reducing ransomware actors\u2019 abilities to scale their operations.\u201dNow, \u201cmany underground actors call for the return of ransomware groups to the mainstream underground.\u201dThe consequence of bringing ransomware groups back into the fold \u201cwould not only enable those actors to target Western organizations more efficiently but also embolden them, as other underground actors would likely herald ransomware actors\u2019 return and give those ransomware actors perceived moral reason to conduct attacks,\u201d the report concluded.Increasingly Targeting Critical InfrastructureThe report described an increasing volume of attacks against the West, \u201cespecially in the resources, government, media, financial and insurance industries,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe targeting of financial and insurance entities is due to the perception that they are the working arms of Western financial sanctions, whereas the targeting of utilities and resources entities is due to those organizations\u2019 importance as critical national infrastructure.\u201dCritical infrastructure will be of particular concern, especially if ransomware groups have the political motive \u2013 plus the tools of the rest of the underground community at their disposal.\u201cOrganizations within telecommunications, IT, government and critical infrastructure are no doubt on a heightened level of security with the current events in the geopolitical environment,\u201d James McQuiggan of KnowBe4 told Threatpost via email, but \u201ccybersecurity is finally becoming an important topic for the government, considering the number of attacks the various agencies have dealt with over the past number of years.\u201dIf the cyber onslaught in Ukraine extends West, will the United States and the European Union be ready?The answer to that question may arrive soon.Moving to the cloud?

The fresh attention was triggered by a penetration tester and security researcher \u2013 who goes by the handle mr.d0x \u2013 who posted a description of BitB.Ghostwriter actors quickly picked up on BitB, combining it with another of the advanced persistent threat\u2019s (APT\u2019s) phishing techniques: namely, hosting credential-phishing landing pages on compromised sites.BitBThe newly disclosed credential-phishing method of BitB\u00a0 takes advantage of third-party single sign-on (SSO) options embedded on websites that issue popup windows for authentication, such as \u201cSign in with Google,\u201d Facebook, Apple or Microsoft.These days, SSO popups are a routine way to authenticate when you sign in.But according to mr.d0x\u2019s post, completely fabricating a malicious version of a popup window is a snap: It\u2019s \u201cquite simple\u201d using basic HTML/CSS, the researcher said a few weeks ago. The concocted popups simulate a browser window within the browser, spoofing a legitimate domain and making it possible to stage convincing phishing attacks.\u201cCombine the window design with an iframe pointing to the malicious server hosting the phishing page, and [it\u2019s] basically indistinguishable,\u201d mr.d0x wrote at the time.JavaScript can make the window appear on a link, button click or page loading screen. As well, libraries \u2013 such as the popular JQuery JavaScript library \u2013 can make the window appear visually appealing.BitB Credential Phishing on Compromised SitesIn Wednesday\u2019s post, TAG gave an example, shown below, of how Ghostwriter has taken to hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised sites:Example of hosting credential phishing landing pages on compromised sites. Source: TAG.The BitB technique shown above entails drawing a login page that appears to be on the passport.i.ua domain, over the page hosted on the compromised site. \u201cOnce a user provides credentials in the dialog, they are posted to an attacker controlled domain,\u201d TAG researchers said.TAG has recently observed Ghostwriter credential-phishing on these domains:login-verification[.]toplogin-verify[.]topua-login[.]topsecure-ua[.]spacesecure-ua[.]topOther Campaigns Launched by Government-Backed Actors in China, Iran, North Korea & RussiaSince early March, Ghostwriter\u2019s use of BitB is only one of a trio of cyber aggressions that TAG has been tracking with regards to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.The use of the war as a lure in phishing and malware campaigns has continued to grow throughout the month, TAG said, with associated cyber-assaults coming in from government-backed actors from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia, as well as from various unattributed groups, according to TAG\u2019s Wednesday post.Actors \u201chave used various Ukraine war-related themes in an effort to get targets to open malicious emails or click malicious links,\u201d TAG said.Curious GorgeBesides Ghostwriter\u2019s BitB campaigns, TAG has spotted a group it\u2019s calling Curious Gorge that it attributes to China\u2019s PLA SSF conducting campaigns against government and military organizations in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia.\u201cWhile this activity largely does not impact Google products, we remain engaged and are providing notifications to victim organizations,\u201d TAG advised.Below is a list of IPs used in Curious Gorge campaigns that TAG has recently observed:5.188.108[.]11991.216.190[.]58103.27.186[.]23114.249.31[.]17145.154.12[.]167COLDRIVERFinally, TAG has also observed COLDRIVER \u2013 a Russia-based threat actor, sometimes referred to as Calisto \u2013 that has launched credential-phishing campaigns targeting several United States-based NGOs and think tanks, the military of a Balkans country, and a Ukraine based defense contractor.Now, however, for the first time, COLDRIVER is targeting the military of multiple Eastern European countries and a NATO Centre of Excellence, TAG reported.Google doesn\u2019t know how successful these campaigns have been, given that they were issued from newly created Gmail accounts to non-Google accounts.

        "raw text": "\u201cAs tanks rolled into Ukraine, so did malware,\u201d summarized humanitarian author Andreas Harsono, referring to the novel malware that Microsoft has named FoxBlade.On Monday, the company reported that its Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) had detected cyberattacks launched against Ukraine\u2019s digital infrastructure hours before Russia\u2019s tanks and missiles began to pummel the country on Thursday.\u201cSeveral hours before the launch of missiles or movement of tanks on February 24, Microsoft\u2019s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) detected a new round of offensive and destructive cyberattacks directed against Ukraine\u2019s digital infrastructure,\u201d Microsoft President and Vice-Chair Brad Smith said.\u201cWe immediately advised the Ukrainian government about the situation, including our identification of the use of a new malware package (which we denominated FoxBlade), and provided technical advice on steps to prevent the malware\u2019s success.\u201dSmith said that within three hours of discovering FoxBlade, Microsoft had added new signatures to its Defender anti-malware service to detect the exploit.FoxBlade SpecificsMicrosoft has issued a Security Intelligence advisory about FoxBlade, which is a novel trojan.While the company shared neither technical specifics nor details about how FoxBlade achieves initial access on targeted machines, the advisory did explain that \u201cThis trojan can use your PC for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks without your knowledge.\u201dSuch attacks topped thousands daily in Q3 and were expected to keep growing, Kaspersky researchers reported in November 2021.Beyond launching DDoS attacks, FoxBlade also downloads and installs other programs \u2013 including other malware \u2013 onto infected systems, Microsoft advised.\u2018Precisely Targeted\u2019The cyberattacks \u2013 which were ongoing as of Monday, Smith said \u2013 have been \u201cprecisely targeted,\u201d unlike the indiscriminate malware splattered in the NotPetya attack. The NotPetya cyberattack targeted hundreds of firms and hospitals worldwide in 2017, including Ukraine\u2019s power grid.In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged six Russian nationals for their alleged part in the Ukraine and other cyberattacks.Regardless of the targeted nature of the current cyberattacks on Ukraine, Smith said Microsoft is still \u201cespecially concerned\u201d about recent cyberattacks aimed at Ukrainian civilian digital targets that have been more wide-ranging, including those fired at the financial sector, agriculture sector, emergency response services, humanitarian aid efforts, and energy sector organizations and enterprises.\u201cThese attacks on civilian targets raise serious concerns under the Geneva Convention, and we have shared information with the Ukrainian government about each of them,\u201d Smith said.Microsoft has also advised the Ukrainian government about recent cyber efforts to steal a range of personally identifiable information (PII), including PII related to health, insurance, transportation and other government data.Microsoft has also passed on threat intelligence and defensive strategies to Ukraine\u2019s government so that it could better defend against attacks on military institutions and manufacturers and several other Ukrainian government agencies.\u201cThis work is ongoing,\u201d Smith said.The Ongoing CyberwarMicrosoft\u2019s news about FoxBlade comes as just one of a continuing barrage of cyber assaults targeting both Ukraine and Russia: a barrage that\u2019s included the Conti ransomware gang proclaiming that it\u2019s pro-Russia. Last week, it, the extortionists blared out a warning on their blog, threatening to use Conti\u2019s \u201cfull capacity\u201d to retaliate in the face of \u201cWestern warmongers attempt to target critical infrastructure in Russia or any Russian-speaking region of the world.\u201dA pro-Ukraine Conti ransomware gang member subsequently spilled 13 months of the ransomware group\u2019s chats, promising more still to come.As well, ESET and Broadcom\u2019s Symantec last week said that they had discovered a new data wiper malware dubbed HermeticWiper, that\u2019s been used against hundreds of machines in Ukraine. One of the malware samples was compiled back on Dec. 28, pointing to the attacks having been readied two months ago.Then, on Jan. 13,  a destructive wiper malware \u2013 posing as ransomware attacks \u2013 named WhisperGate began to target Ukrainian organizations: an attack that analysts said was likely part of Russia\u2019s wider effort to undermine Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.As well, in mid-February, institutions central to Ukraine\u2019s military and economy \u2013 including government and banking websites \u2013 were slammed with a wave of DDoS attacks.CISA\u2019s Take-Shelter AdviceThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) last week warned that such attacks could spill over Ukraine\u2019s borders.\u201cDestructive malware can present a direct threat to an organization\u2019s daily operations, impacting the availability of critical assets and data,\u201d CISA said. \u201cFurther disruptive cyberattacks against organizations in Ukraine are likely to occur and may unintentionally spill over to organizations in other countries.\u201dOther threats related to the Ukraine/Russia crisis include the typical swarm of threat actors who jump into the fray to exploit the day\u2019s headlines, which, in this situation, convey the haze and confusion of war. Case in point: Malwarebytes has uncovered a spate of malicious email bearing the subject line \u201cMicrosoft account unusual sign-in activity.\u201dCISA provided this list of \u201cImmediate Shields Up Actions\u201d to protect against this wide range of cyber threats:Patch vulnerabilities.Use MFA.Run antivirus.Enable strong spam filters to prevent phishing emails from reaching end users.Disable ports and protocols that are not essential.Strengthen controls for cloud services.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Microsoft has released a workaround for a zero-day flaw that was initially flagged in April and that attackers already have used to target organizations in Russia and Tibet, researchers said.The remote control execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-3019, is associated with the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT), which, ironically, itself collects information about bugs in the company\u2019s products and reports to Microsoft Support.If successfully exploited, attackers can install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts in the context allowed by the user\u2019s rights, the company said.\u201cA remote code execution vulnerability exists when MSDT is called using the URL protocol from a calling application such as Word,\u201d Microsoft explained in its guidance on the Microsoft Security Response Center. \u201cAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can run arbitrary code with the privileges of the calling application.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s workaround comes some six weeks after the vulnerability was apparently first identified. Researchers from Shadow Chaser Group noticed it on April 12 in a bachelor\u2019s thesis from August 2020\u2014with attackers apparently targeting Russian users\u2013and reported to Microsoft on April 21, according to research firm Recorded Future\u2019s The Record.A Malwarebytes Threat Intelligence analyst also spotted the flaw back in April but could not fully identify it, the company said in a post on Twitter over the weekend, retweeting the original post about the vulnerability, also made on April 12, from @h2jazi.When the flaw was reported, Microsoft didn\u2019t consider it an issue. It\u2019s clear now that the company was wrong, and the vulnerability again raised the attention of researchers at\u00a0 Japanese security vendor Nao Sec, who tweeted a fresh warning about it over the weekend, noting that it was being used to target users in Belarus.In analysis over the weekend noted security researcher Kevin Beaumont dubbed the vulnerability \u201cFollina,\u201d explaining the zero-day code references the Italy-based area code of Follina \u2013 0438.Current WorkaroundWhile no patch yet exists for the flaw, Microsoft is recommending that affected users disable the MSDT URL to mitigate it for now. This \u201cprevents troubleshooters being launched as links including links throughout the operating system,\u201d the company wrote in their advisory.To do this, users must follow these steps: Run \u201c:Command Prompt as Administrator\u201c; Back up the registry key by executing the command \u201creg export HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt filename\u201c; and execute the command \u201creg delete HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\ms-msdt /f\u201d.\u201cTroubleshooters can still be accessed using the Get Help application and in system settings as other or additional troubleshooters,\u201d the company said.Moreover, if the calling application is an Office app then by default, Office opens the document from the internet in Protected View and Application Guard for Office, \u201cboth of which prevent the current attack,\u201d Microsoft said. However, Beaumont refuted that assurance in his analysis of the bug.Microsoft also plans to update CVE-2022-3019 with further information but did not specify when it would do so, according to the advisory.Significant RiskIn the meantime, the unpatched flaw poses a significant risk for a number of reasons, Beaumont and other researchers noted.One is that it affects such a wide swathe of users, given that it exists in all currently supported Windows versions and can be exploited via Microsoft Office versions 2013 through Office 2019, Office 2021, Office 365, and Office ProPlus.\u201cEvery organization that is dealing with content, files and in particular Office documents, which is basically everyone in the globe, is currently exposed to this threat,\u201d Aviv Grafi, CTO and founder of security firm Votiro, wrote in an e-mail to Threatpost.Another reason the flaw poses a major threat is its execution without action from end users, both Beaumont and Grafi said. Once the HTML is loaded from the calling application, an MSDT scheme is used to execute a PowerShell code to run a malicious payload, Grafi explained.Since the flaw is abusing the remote template feature in Microsoft Word, it is not dependent on a typical macro-based exploit path, which are common within Office-based attacks, Beaumont said.\u201cWhat makes this vulnerability so difficult to avoid is the fact that the end user does not have to enable macros for the code to execute, making it a \u2018zero-click\u2019 remote code execution technique used through MSDT,\u201d Grafi concurred.Under Active AttackClaire Tills, senior research engineer for security firm Tenable, compared the flaw to last year\u2019s zero-click MSHTML bug, tracked as CVE-2021-40444, which was pummeled by attackers, including the Ryuk ransomware gang.\u201cGiven the similarities between CVE-2022-30190 and CVE-2021-40444, and that researchers speculate other protocol handlers may also be vulnerable, we expect to see further developments and exploitation attempts of this issue,\u201d she wrote in an e-mail to Threatpost.Indeed, threat actors already have pounced on the vulnerability. On Monday, Proofpoint Threat Insight also tweeted that threat actors were using the flaw to target organizations in Tibet by impersonating the \u201cWomen Empowerments Desk\u201d of the Central Tibetan Administration.What\u2019s more, the workaround that Microsoft currently offers itself has issues and won\u2019t provide much of a fix in the long-term, especially with the bug under attack, Grafi said. He said the workaround is\u201dnot friendly for admins\u201d because it involves \u201cchanges in the Registry of the end user\u2019s endpoints.\u201d\u00a0HacksVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered yet another destructive data-wiping malware targeting organizations in Ukraine, the third to be found in as many weeks attacking systems in the country that\u2019s currently defending itself against a Russian physical invasion.A team from cybersecurity firm ESET on Monday uncovered the malware, which they dubbed CaddyWiper, researchers said in a blog post published Tuesday.\u201cThe wiper, which destroys user data and partition information from attached drives, was spotted on several dozen systems in a limited number of organizations,\u201d researchers wrote in the post. \u201cIt\u00a0is detected by ESET products as Win32/KillDisk.NCX.\u201dCaddyWiper follows the spotting of HermeticWiper and IsaacWiper targeting Ukraine \u2014 though it bears no resemblance to them, researchers said.However, similar to HermeticWiper\u2014which was discovered on Feb. 23, the day before the Russian invasion \u2014 \u201cthere\u2019s evidence to suggest that the bad actors behind CaddyWiper infiltrated the target\u2019s network before unleashing the wiper,\u201d researchers said.Advanced Wiper AttackThe HermeticWiper attack came just hours after a series of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) onslaughts knocked several important websites in the country offline, according to ESET. Attackers also deployed a novel trojan called FoxBlade against key Ukrainian digital infrastructure, hours before the physical invasion by Russia, Microsoft researchers reported.While specific details about exactly how CaddyWiper works have yet to be divulged, ESET researchers took a deeper dive into HermeticWiper in a previous blog post on March 1. Evidence also has emerged that one of the HermeticWiper malware samples was compiled back on Dec. 28, signaling that the wiper attacks were primed two months before the Russian military assault.HermeticWiper is a Windows executable with four legitimate drivers from the EaseUS Partition Master software signed by CHENGDU YIWO Tech Development Co. The drivers are embedded in the malware\u2019s resources and implement low-level disk operations, according to ESET.Depending on the OS version, HeremeticWiper choses one of those four drivers is and then drops it in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\<4 random letters>.sys, where it loads by creating a service.\u201cHermeticWiper then proceeds by disabling the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) and wipes itself from disk by overwriting its own file with random bytes,\u201d according to ESET researchers.The HermeticWiper attack also used a custom worm dubbed HermeticWizard for propagating the wiper inside local networks, as well as HermeticRansom, a decoy ransomware used in the attack, according to ESET. A free decryptor later was released to unlock HermeticRansom, which also targeted organizations in Lithuania and Latvia.Following the HermeticWiper attack, on the day the kinetic war began in Ukraine, cyberattackers deployed the \u201cless sophisticated\u201d IsaacWiper in an organization unconnected to the HermeticWiper attacks, according to ESET.Consistent Barrage of AttacksEven before the three wiper attacks occurred in succession, Russian-based cyber actors have been barraging Ukraine with wiper attacks, often disguised as ransomware, researchers have observed. The cyber-war occurring concurrently with the conflict on the ground is seen by many as Russia attempting to undermine Ukraine\u2019s position as a sovereign nation from as many angles as it can.Prior to Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine was the target of a Master Boot Record (MBR) wiper attack that started Jan. 13, which was discovered and dubbed WhisperGate by Microsoft researchers. The wiper had previously been used against government systems, nonprofit organizations and IT companies in Ukraine.In that attack, perpetrators provided a ransom note as one of several efforts to make it look like a ransomware attack. However, the attack really served to destroy MBRs and the contents of the files it targets, researchers from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center said at the time.Indeed, Ukraine has been on the receiving end of a number of highly disruptive cyberattacks since 2014, according to ESET; that\u2019s also the year a coup toppled pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Among those cyberattacks was the now-infamous NotPetya attack, which originated in the Ukraine in 2017 before spreading globally to become one of the worst cyberattacks in history.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Russia is positioned for a hot-war attack on Ukraine that the Biden administration warned could come \u201cat any point\u201d \u2014 but the country is already suffering an attack of a different kind. A sweeping malware campaign remains ongoing, which experts agree is intended to permanently disrupt organizations across the country and paint Ukraine as a failed state.The cyberattacks represent a coordinated destructive malware operation which has already impacted dozens of systems across the country, according to an alert from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MCTIC) this week.The cyberattacks on organizations across Ukraine started on Jan. 13, according to MCTIC, and based on the team\u2019s assessment, the malware is a Master Boot Record (MBR) wiper. The destructor, which Microsoft has named WhisperGate, has already been used against government systems, non-profit organizations and IT companies in Ukraine, the report warned.The perpetrators are taking pains to make the attacks look like a ransomware attack, even providing a ransom note. However, the reality is that \u201cthe ransomware note is a ruse and\u2026the malware destructs MBR and the contents of the files it targets,\u201d according to MCTIC. It added, \u201cMSTIC assesses that the malware\u2026is intended to be destructive and designed to render targeted devices inoperable rather than to obtain a ransom.\u201dThe team expects to find additional victims of the attack as part of its continuing investigation.\u201cWe do not know the current stage of this attacker\u2019s operational cycle or how many other victim organizations may exist in Ukraine or other geographic locations,\u201d the MSTIC alert added. \u201cHowever, it is unlikely these impacted systems represent the full scope of impact as other organizations are reporting.\u201dAttacks Similar to NotPetya, WannaCry Overwriting the MBR \u2014 typically a \u201cnuclear\u201d option (as seen in the 2012 Saudi Aramco Shamoon attack) \u2014 is atypical for cybercriminal ransomware. As such, experts surmised that government-backed actors are most likely behind the hacks, which are similar to previous NotPetya attacks\u00a0on Ukraine.Raj Samani, Trellix fellow and chief scientist, said there are also additional similarities between this latest round of attacks and the WannaCry campaign, which he described having a similar \u201cpseudo-ransomware nature.\u201d\u201cWe have identified threat indicators targeting a range of industries, including government, financial services, transportation and utilities,\u201d Samani explained. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that such actions, in conjunction with the inability to pay, infers a destructive campaign, or indeed one intended to spread fear and hysteria.\u201dSaumitra Das, CTO and founder of Blue Hexagon, agreed that this type of destructive malware doesn\u2019t offer a cash payoff for the everyday cybercrook, which supports the state-backed actor theory.\u201cThe tactics used in this attack seem to focus on disruption rather than moneymaking,\u201d Das explained to Threatpost. \u201cWiping the MBR, causing systems to go down, is not beneficial to criminal gangs out to make a quick buck \u2014 but it\u2019s very effective for nation states as a provocation or tool used for larger aims. Usually, malware that extorts based on disruption does not usually make the system inoperable but merely throttles it.\u201dSilas Cutler, threat analyst at Stairwell, told Threatpost that the phony ransomware amount demanded in the attacks is ridiculously low by industry standards, further indicating that the attacks were never about the cash.\u201cThe ransom demand shared in its original format by Microsoft is different from current ransomware trends in that the sum is a tenth of what sophisticated groups would demand; and, they offer limited ways to communicate with the attackers,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear at this time why the ransom demand is so low. It\u2019s possible the actor chose an arbitrarily low amount in hopes that some organizations may attempt to pay in a panic to recover before reporting and guidance about the malware was made public.\u201dRussia\u2019s Hybrid War Against Ukraine?As for which nation-state may be behind the effort, Microsoft doesn\u2019t attribute WhisperGate to any specific country. Others are not as circumspect.\u201cWhile not currently attributed to any known actor group or country of origin, Russia is generally considered the primary suspect,\u201d Cutler said. \u201cThe reported use of destructive malware, using ransomware as a cover, is a tactic that\u2019s been previously observed in Russian attacks against Ukrainian organizations such as in the Ukraine blackout and NotPetya attacks in 2015 to 2017.\u201dScheherazade Rehman, Professor of International Affairs at George Washington University, explained to Threatpost that this show of cyberwarfare fits into the larger \u201chybrid war\u201d being waged by the Russian government against Ukraine.\u201cRussia wants the rest of the world to see that they are planning significant military activity in Ukraine and their tactics involve an attack on all fronts: 100,000 troops and military equipment build-up on the border, planting insurgents to stage a \u2018false-flag\u2019 operation, and cyber-attacks on Kyiv\u2019s government computer systems,\u201d Dr. Rehman told Threatpost.She added this step toward \u201cdismantling the Ukrainian infrastructure\u201d is part of the Russian narrative that Ukraine is an illegitimate, failed state.\u201cAlthough not definitive, the cyberattacks are almost certainly from Russia,\u201d Rehman said. \u201cIt was a two-prong attack and the largest in four years.\u201dThe first prong, she said, was last week\u2019s breach of more than 70 Ukrainian government sites that posted a defacement message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish:\u201cUkrainians! \u2026 All information about you has become public. Be afraid and expect worse.

        "raw text": "While legitimate concerns abound about the Russian-Ukrainian conflict sparking a far-reaching cyberwarfare conflagration around the globe, small-time crooks are also ramping up their efforts amid the crisis. Phishing emails to Microsoft users warning of Moscow-led account hacking have started to make the rounds, looking to lift credentials and other personal details.That\u2019s according to Malwarebytes, which uncovered a spate of spam email that name-checks Russian hacking efforts. The subject line for the messages is \u201cMicrosoft account unusual sign-in activity,\u201d researchers noted.The body reads:Unusual sign-in activityWe detected something unusual about a recent sign-in to the Microsoft accountSign-in detailsCountry/region: Russia/MoscowIP address:Date: Sat, 26 Feb 2022 02:31:23 +0100Platform: Kali LinuxBrowser: FirefoxA user from Russia/Moscow just logged into your account from a new device, If this wasn\u2019t you, please report the user.

Either way, people are at risk from losing control of their account to the phishers. The best thing to do is not reply, and delete the email.\u201dAs ever, the spam offers up red flags in the form of grammatical errors, including misspellings, such as \u201cacount.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not a particularly sophisticated effort, but it\u2019s a savvy one.

        "raw text": "The SolarWinds attackers \u2013 an advanced persistent threat (APT) known as Nobelium \u2013 have started a new wave of supply-chain intrusions, this time using the technology reseller/service provider community to attack their targets.The activity has affected victims in North America and Europe thus far, researchers said, and the goal is espionage: Nobelium has been linked to the Russian government\u2019s foreign intelligence service, known as SVR.According to an analysis from Mandiant and Microsoft, Nobelium isn\u2019t exploiting a vulnerability or, as was the case with SolarWinds, trojanizing legitimate code. Instead, it\u2019s infiltrating reseller networks using tried-and-true tactics like credential-stuffing and phishing, as well as API abuse and token theft, in order to gather legitimate account credentials and privileged access to reseller networks.From there, Nobelium attempts to pivot and land inside the networks of reseller customers downstream. Once inside a reseller network, it becomes much easier to impersonate the company and exploit the trusted relationship that reseller has with its customers, researchers pointed out.\u201cMandiant has investigated multiple intrusions in 2021 where suspected Russian threat actors exploited supply-chain relationships between technology companies and their customers,\u201d said Mandiant senior vice president and CTO Charles Carmakal, via email. \u201cWhile the SolarWinds supply-chain attack involved malicious code inserted in legitimate software, most of this recent intrusion activity has involved leveraging stolen identities and the networks of technology solutions, services and reseller companies in North America and Europe to ultimately access the environments of organizations that are targeted by the Russian government.\u201dSince May, Microsoft has observed Nobelium attacking more than 140 resellers and technology service providers, it said, with about 14 of them succumbing to compromise. However, in its writeup, issued Sunday, the software giant didn\u2019t say how many downstream customers have been affected.Mandiant\u2019s Carmakal only said that the firm has seen successful intrusions into on-premises and cloud victim environments.\u201cThis attack path makes it very difficult for victim organizations to discover they were compromised and investigate the actions taken by the threat actor,\u201d Carmakal said. \u201cInvestigating these intrusions requires collaboration and information-sharing across multiple victim organizations, which is challenging due to privacy concerns and organizational sensitivities.\u201dThe approach is also particularly effective for Nobelium because it allows the cyberattackers to avoid dealing with what could be strong defense measures at the end-user targets, he added.\u201cIt shifts the initial intrusion away from the ultimate targets, which in some situations are organizations with more mature cyberdefenses, to smaller technology partners with less mature cyberdefenses,\u201d he said.If successful, an attack could allow for data theft, reconnaissance, compromise of customer systems and more.Systemic Access to the Technology Supply Chain\u201cNobelium ultimately hopes to piggyback on any direct access that resellers may have to their customers\u2019 IT systems,\u201d according to Microsoft. \u201cThis recent activity is another indicator that Russia is trying to gain long-term, systematic access to a variety of points in the technology supply chain and establish a mechanism for surveilling \u2013 now or in the future \u2013 targets of interest to the Russian government.\u201dTo that point, Microsoft also said that this particular campaign is merely a subset of a larger wave of Nobelium activities, which points to significantly ramped-up efforts by Russia to establish a persistent anchor for its spy activities. For instance, in September it was seen installing the FoggyWeb custom backdoor on single sign-on servers.\u201cBetween July 1 and Oct. 19 this year, we informed 609 customers that they had been attacked 22,868 times by Nobelium, with a success rate in the low single digits,\u201d according to its writeup. \u201cBy comparison, prior to July 1, we had notified customers about attacks from all nation-state actors 20,500 times over the past three years.\u201dThe U.S. Needs to Do MoreFamously, the SolarWinds attack caused widespread damage and allowed Nobelium to gain access to several U.S. government agencies, by hijacking a legitimate software update from the platform to push malware to SolarWinds users.While the reseller campaign is of a smaller scale, Jamil Jaffer, former associate White House Counsel to President George W. Bush and a senior vice president for IronNet Cybersecurity, noted that it highlights the need for the government to do more to thwart Russian hacking.\u201c[This showcases] the need to take more aggressive action to impose costs in order to deter such activity by Russia,\u201d he told Threatpost via email. \u201cIt also highlights the need for the U.S. government to expand its defensive collaboration with the U.S. private sector\u2026It is clear that the previously imposed sanctions for both hacking activity as well as Russia\u2019s support of ransomware attacks have not adequately deterred Russian cyber-activity against the U.S. private sector.\u201dHe added that the Biden Administration has put in place a top-notch team of cyber-experts, who could make some changes.\u201cThey must be freed up to work more effectively and collaboratively with the private sector to create a true collective defense capability where industry and government work together to stop such attacks, including through the new Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative established by the new director of CISA at DHS, Jen Easterly,\u201d he noted.How Resellers Can Defend Against NobeliumFor now, the intrusion activity is ongoing, and both Microsoft and Mandiant said they\u2019re actively working with affected organizations. To protect themselves, resellers and service providers can take several basic steps to implement specific security protections for their environments, researchers noted, such as restricting access to partner portals and other customer-relationship management tools, and enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA).They should also audit any delegated privileged accounts and remove unnecessary authority clearances, and, if possible, adopt a zero-trust security ideology.\u201cIT supply chain companies must act now to avoid becoming the next SolarWinds,\u201d said Danny Lopez, CEO of Glasswall, via email. \u201cTo prevent these attackers from gaining privileged access and wreaking havoc, organizations need to adopt robust processes for onboarding and offboarding employees and affiliates that may receive access to key information systems. It\u2019s vital to control privileged access and to monitor those that enjoy that administrator privilege.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis will help to limit the blast radius, and in most cases, defeat the data breach.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.BreachGovernmentHacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Cyberattacks against Ukraine have been used strategically to support ground campaigns, with five state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) groups behind attacks that began in February. According to research published by Microsoft on Wednesday, the APTs involved in the campaigns are state-sponsored by Russia.Separate reports published this week also shed new light on the wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian digital assets by APTs with ties to Russia.Microsoft researchers believe six separate Russia-aligned threat actors carried out 237 cyber operations that resulted in threats to civilian welfare and attempted to carry out dozens of cyberespionage attacks against Ukrainian targets.Moreover, Russia is believed to be using cyberattacks in a type of \u201chybrid war\u201d, according to a blog post by Tom Burt, corporate vice president of Customer Security and Trust at Microsoft. That correlates \u00a0\u201cwith its kinetic military operations targeting services and institutions crucial for civilians,\u201d he said.\u201cThe attacks have not only degraded the systems of institutions in Ukraine but have also sought to disrupt people\u2019s access to reliable information and critical life services on which civilians depend, and have attempted to shake confidence in the country\u2019s leadership,\u201d Burt wrote.Meanwhile, researchers at Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) have been doing analysis of their own on the cyber-attacks that have been hampered the country in the lead up to and during the war.\u00a0 The agency said it recorded 802 cyber attacks in the first quarter of 2022 alone, more than double the number for the same period last year, which was 362.Carrying out those attacks are primarily five known Russia or Belarus-sponsored APTs, CERT-UA said. Specifically, those groups are: Armageddon/Garmaredon, UNC1151, Fancy Bear/APT28, AgentTesla/XLoader and Pandora hVNC/GrimPlant/GraphSteel.\u2018Hybrid\u2019 WarMicrosoft security teams have been working closely with Ukrainian government officials as well as both government and private-enterprise cybersecurity staff to identify and remediate threat activity against Ukrainian networks, researchers said.Russia appears to have been preparing for the land conflict with Ukraine in cyberspace about a year before the war began, or since March 2021, according to the report.In the lead up to the ground conflict and the subsequent invasion, threat groups with known or suspected ties Russia \u201ccontinuously developed and used destructive wiper malware or similarly destructive tools on targeted Ukrainian networks at a pace of two to three incidents a week,\u201d researchers found.\u201cFrom February 23 to April 8, we saw evidence of nearly 40 discrete destructive attacks that permanently destroyed files in hundreds of systems across dozens of organizations in Ukraine,\u201d they wrote.Even before that, in January, Microsoft identified a Master Boot Record (MBR) wiper attack that it named WhisperGate targeting Ukraine to permanently disrupt organizations across the country and paint it as a failed state. Wipers are the most destructive of malware types because they permanently delete and destroy data and/or systems, causing great financial and reputational damage to victims.From late February to mid-March, another series of wiper attacks using malware called HermeticWiper, IsaacWiper and CaddyWiper targeted organizations in the Ukraine as Russia commenced its physical invasion.Attacks on Critical InfrastructureIn its latest report, Microsoft said that more than 40 percent of the destructive attacks against Ukraine were aimed at organizations in critical infrastructure sectors that could have negative second-order effects on the government, military, economy and the country\u2019s people.Moreover, 32 percent of destructive incidents affected Ukrainian government organizations at the national, regional and city levels.\u201cAcknowledging that there is ongoing activity that we cannot see, we estimate there have been at least eight destructive malware families deployed on Ukrainian networks, including one tailored to industrial control systems (ICS),\u201d researchers wrote. \u201d If threat actors can maintain the current pace of development and deployment, we anticipate more destructive malware will be discovered as the conflict continues.\u201dThe report includes a specific timeline of attacks and the malware used in the earliest weeks of the attack to support Russia\u2019s military activities. In addition to the wipers previously mentioned, other malware deployed in the attacks includes: FoxBlade, DesertBlade, FiberLake, SonicVote and Industroyer2.Frequent OffendersOn the heels of CERT-UA\u2019s revelation of the top ATPs pummeling Ukraine in cyberspace, research firm Recorded Future\u2019s The Record took a deeper dive into each other to examine its specific affiliations and modus operandi.Armageddon/Garmaredon is an aggressive threat actor that\u2019s been targeting Ukraine since 2014 and is backed by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). During the Russian war on Ukraine the group has used phishing attacks to distribute malware, most recently new variants of the \u201cBackdoor.Pterodo\u201d malware payload, according to researchers.UNC1151 is a Belarus-aligned hacking group who has been active since 2016 and has previously targeted government agencies and private organizations in Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Germany, as well as attacked Belarusian dissidents and journalists, researchers said, citing research from Mandiant.Since Russia attacked Ukraine UNC1151 the group has been linked to the defacement of multiple Ukrainian government websites as well as spearphishing campaigns targeting the email and facebook accounts of Ukrainian military personnel to spread the MicroBackdoor malware.Fancy Bear/APT 28 is a well-known and prolific actor active since 2017 and backed by Russia\u2019s military intelligence service (GRU). The politically motivated group has been linked to activity aiming to influence elections in the European Union and the United States as well as attacking sporting authorities connected to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.On Feb. 24, the day Russia attacked Ukraine, Fancy Bear gained access to U.S. satellite communications provider Viasat\u2019s KA-SAT network in Ukraine, leaving many Ukrainians without internet access and thus communication capability at the critical time when attacks began, researchers said.Russian threat actors have used the AgentTesla and XLoader malwares since at least 2014 and 2020, respectively; both have been used in high-profile attacks. During Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, one malicious email campaign targeting Ukrainian state organizations used XLoader as its payload, while a phishing campaign targeting Ukrainian citizens spread AgentTesla,, researchers said.Pandora hVNC/GrimPlant/GraphSteel act as downloaders and droppers under the umbrella term \u201cElephant Framework,\u201d or tools that are written in the same language and used to target government organizations through phishing attacks, researchers said. In two separate malicious phishing campaigns in March, they were used against Ukrainian targets to steal sensitive information from government officials, among others, they said.History of Cyberattacks in UkraineIn March, Kaspersky\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) outlined its\u2019 tracking of current and past cyberattacks in Ukraine.Courtesy of Kaspersky\u201cThe number of cyberattacks in Ukraine will increase during the next six months. While most of the current attacks are of low complexity \u2013 such as DDoS or attacks using commodity and low-quality tools \u2013 more sophisticated attacks exist also, and more are expected to come,\u201d Kaspersky researchers wrote.\u201cCurrent complex activities include the employment of HermeticWiper, which stands out due to its sophistication, as well as the Viasat \u2018cyber event\u2019 \u2013 the partial network outage that impacted internet service for fixed broadband customers in Ukraine and elsewhere on the European KA-SAT network that affected over 30,000 plus terminals in Europe,\u201d the Kaspersky report added.\u00a0\u00a0GovernmentHacks",

        "raw text": "Microsoft seized seven domains it claims were part of ongoing cyberattacks by what it said are state-sponsored Russian advanced persistent threat actors that targeted Ukrainian-related digital assets.The company obtained court orders to take control of the domains it said were used by Strontium, also known as APT28, Sofacy, Fancy Bear and Sednit. In a blog post outlining the actions, Microsoft reported attackers used the domains to target Ukrainian media organizations, government institutions and foreign policy think tanks based in the U.S. and Europe.\u201cWe obtained a court order authorizing us to take control of seven internet domains Strontium was using to conduct these attacks,\u201d said Tom Burt, corporate vice president of Customer Security and Trust at Microsoft.Sinkhole is a security term that refers to the redirection of internet traffic from domains, at the domain-server network level, by security researchers for analysis and mitigation. Microsoft did not specify how the domains were specifically being abused, beyond identifying those targeted.\u201cWe have since re-directed these domains to a sinkhole controlled by Microsoft, enabling us to mitigate Strontium\u2019s current use of these domains and enable victim notifications,\u201d Burt said.Researchers, said the APT was attempting to establish persistent, or long-term, access to a target\u2019s system. This, they suggested, would facilitate a second stage attack that would likely include extraction of sensitive information such as credentials.\u201cThis disruption is part of ongoing long-term investment, started in 2016, to take legal and technical action to seize infrastructure being used by Strontium. We have established a legal process that enables us to obtain rapid court decisions for this work,\u201d Microsoft said.Sinkhole HistoryPrior to this, Microsoft seized 91 malicious domains as part of 15 separate court orders against what it asserts are Russian-language threat groups, dating back to August 2014.The use of going through the courts to obtain a temporary restraining order against those identified as behind the malicious domains has been the main method that Microsoft has used to disrupt malicious campaigns. The court order shuts down the malicious activity and gives Microsoft the legal authority to reroute traffic to domains Microsoft controls.Sinkholes are a time-tested and accepted method for disrupting the operation of botnets and other malware enterprises and are used in a variety of ways. Researchers often will work with hosting providers to reroute traffic from malicious domains to ones controlled by the researchers or by law enforcement, helping to cut off the lifeline of the criminal operations and allow for a forensic analysis of traffic used to establish the source, nature and scope of an attack.In the case of APT28, in 2016 the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US Department of Homeland Security implicated the hacking group in attacks against several U.S. election-related targets.More recently, Strontium is believed to have teamed up with Belarusian hacking group Ghostwriter to launch phishing attacks targeting Ukrainian officials, according to Google. European satellite services have also been targeted by unverified threat actors as part of an escalating cyber offensive designed to hurt Ukraine.\u00a0Reported By: Sagar Tiwari, an independent security researcher and technical writer.Malware",

        "raw text": "While Russia is fighting a physical war on the ground against Ukraine, advanced persistent threat (APT) groups affiliated with or backing Vladimir Putin\u2019s government are ramping up phishing and other attacks against Ukrainian and European targets in cyberspace, Google is warning.Researchers from Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) have seen an increase in activity ranging \u201cfrom espionage to phishing campaigns\u201d from threat groups known as FancyBear/APT28 and Ghostwriter/UNC1151, Shane Huntley, director of software engineering at Google TAG, wrote in a blog post published Monday. The former has been attributed to Russia\u2019s GRU intelligence agency, and the latter is an actor that Ukraine previously said is part of the Belarusian Ministry of Defense.Meanwhile, there have been a recent spate of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against Ukrainian government sites, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as well as key services that help Ukrainians find information, such as Liveuamap, according to Google TAG.China\u2019s Mustang Panda also has joined the fray, using the war in Ukraine to target European entities with lures related to the Ukrainian invasion in a recent phishing campaign. China\u2019s government is one of the few around the world backing Putin in the conflict.\u201cWe\u2019re sharing this information to help raise awareness among the security community and high risk users,\u201d Huntley wrote in the post.Phishing FlurryFancy Bear, the APT behind attacks against the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and elections in the European Union, most recently has been targeting users of ukr.net \u2013 owned by the Ukrainian media company URKNet \u2013 with \u201cseveral large credential phishing campaigns,\u201d Huntley wrote.\u201cThe phishing emails are sent from a large number of compromised accounts (non-Gmail/Google), and include links to attacker controlled domains,\u201d according to the post.In two recent campaigns, TAG saw attackers using newly created Blogspot domains as the initial landing page, which then redirected targets to credential phishing pages. At this time, all known attacker-controlled Blogspot domains have been taken down, Huntley added.Meanwhile, Ghostwriter has conducted similarly motivated phishing campaigns over the past week against Polish and Ukrainian government and military organizations, according to Google TAG. The group also has been targeting webmail users from the following providers in the region: i.ua, meta.ua, rambler.ru, ukr.net, wp.pl and yandex.ru.Google TAG blocked a number of credential phishing domains that researchers observed during the campaigns through Google Safe Browsing, according to the post. Those domains included the following: accounts[.]secure-ua[.]website, i[.]ua-passport[.]top, login[.]creditals-email[.]space, post[.]mil-gov[.]space and verify[.]rambler-profile[.]site.Capitalizing on ConflictNot to be outdone, China\u2019s Mustang Panda, aka Temp.Hex, HoneyMyte, TA416 or RedDelta, is using phishing lures related to the conflict in the Ukraine to target European organizations.\u201cTAG identified malicious attachments with file names such as \u2018Situation at the EU borders with Ukraine.zip\u2019 which contain an executable of the same name that is a basic downloader,\u201d Huntley explained in the post. When executed, the file downloads several additional files that install the final, malicious payload, according to TAG.While Huntley noted that targeted Europe represents a shift for the threat actor \u2013 which typically targets entities in Southeast Asia \u2013 Mustang Panda has been active against EU entities before, most notably targeting Rome\u2019s Vatican and Catholic Church-related organizations with a spearphishing campaign in September 2020.To mitigate the APT\u2019s latest phishing attacks, TAG has alerted relevant authorities of its findings, Huntley noted.Expanding DDoS ProtectionAs APTs step up phishing attacks against Ukrainian targets, key government and service-oriented websites in the country also are facing a new barrage of DDoS attacks, as mentioned.As these attacks are likely to continue, Google has expanded eligibility for Project Shield, the company\u2019s free protection against DDoS attacks, to \u201cUkrainian government websites, embassies worldwide and other governments in close proximity to the conflict,\u201d Huntley wrote. More than 150 websites in Ukraine, including many news organizations, are currently using the service.Project Shield allows Google to absorb the bad traffic in a DDoS attack so the targeted organization can continue operating and defend against these attacks, according to the post. The company is recommending that eligible organizations register for Project Shield in the wake of increased DDoS attack activity, Huntley wrote.Register Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event sked for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

Its subject: \u201cIN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DECISION OF THE EMERGENCY MEETING OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL OF UKRAINE DATED 24.02.2022.\u201d It contained a macros-enabled Microsoft Excel (.xls) spreadsheet titled \u201clist of persons.xlsx\u201d that, when opened, delivered malware called SunSeed.The email originated from a ukr.net address, which is a Ukrainian military email address. Oddly enough, the researchers were able to trace the address to a publicly available procurement document for a Stihl-brand lawn mower, purchased back in 2016. The order was made by \u201c\u0412\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u04102622,\u201d a military unit based in Chernihiv, Ukraine. Exactly how the attackers obtained access to a military email address is not clear.This phishing targeted a very specific group of European government personnel involved in managing the outflux of refugees from Ukraine. Though the targets \u201cpossessed a range of expertise and professional responsibilities,\u201d the report noted, \u201cthere was a clear preference for targeting individuals with responsibilities related to transportation, financial and budget allocation, administration, and population movement within Europe.\u201dThe goal in targeting these specific individuals was \u201cto gain intelligence regarding the logistics surrounding the movement of funds, supplies, and people within NATO member countries,\u201d according to the report.Attackers Tied to Belarus, Russia by ExtensionThe report noted that no \u201cconcrete\u201d evidence can \u201cdefinitively\u201d tie this campaign to a particular threat actor. Still, the researchers noted a bevy of similarities between this phishing campaign and another campaign from July of last year that targeted U.S. cybersecurity and defense companies.The July campaign \u201cutilized a highly similar macro-laden XLS attachment to deliver MSI packages that install a Lua malware script,\u201d according to Proofpoint researchers. Lua is the programming language in which SunSeed is coded. \u201cSimilarly, the campaign utilized a very recent government report as the basis of the social engineering content,\u201d they added.The file name in that campaign \u2013 \u201clist of participants of the briefing.xls.\u201d \u2013 bears striking resemblance to the one used in this new campaign. Furthermore, \u201cthe Lua script created a nearly identical URI beacon to the SunSeed sample, which was composed of the infected victim\u2019s C Drive partition serial number. Analysis of the cryptography calls in both samples revealed that the same version of WiX 3.11.0.1528 had been utilized to create the MSI packages.\u201dThese overlaps allowed the researchers to conclude with moderate confidence that the two campaigns were perpetrated by the same threat actor: TA445. According to Mandiant, the group is based in Minsk, connected to the Belarusian military, and conducts its business in the interests of the Belarusian government. Belarus is a close ally of Russia.The researchers concluded with a disclaimer. On balancing \u201cresponsible reporting with the quickest possible disclosure of actionable intelligence,\u201d they wrote, \u201cthe onset of hybrid conflict, including within the cyber domain, has accelerated the pace of operations and reduced the amount of time that defenders have to answer deeper questions around attribution and historical correlation to known nation-state operators.\u201dUkraine\u2019s Unprecedented Cyber TargetingThis phishing campaign isn\u2019t the worst Ukraine-oriented cyberattack in recent weeks, or even recent days. Still, the researchers noted that \u201cwhile the utilized techniques in this campaign are not groundbreaking individually, if deployed collectively, and during a high tempo conflict, they possess the capability to be quite effective.\u201dThomas Stoesser, of comforte AG, told Threatpost via email that this attack \u201cshows just how ruthless and clever threat actors can be in adapting existing social engineering tactics.\u201d\u201cThe situation underscores two key points that every enterprise should heed,\u201d he added. \u201cOne, it\u2019s not enough simply to educate employees sporadically about common social engineering tactics. [Companies] need to put a premium on employees treating every email with healthy skepticism. Two, protect all sensitive enterprise data with more than just perimeter security, even if you feel that the impenetrable vault you\u2019ve stored it all in is foolproof.\u201dRegister Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event sked for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

The ring was apparently run by stringing together 3,800 Sony PlayStation 4 (PS4) gaming consoles.Cryptominers serve as auditors for endless strings of blockchain ledgers, which is some cases is rewarded with cryptocurrency, which itself isn\u2019t illegal. But stealing the vast amounts of electricity needed to power the computer farms required to mine cryptocurrency is most definitely prohibited.This group of PS4-powered cryptominers, according to the Security Service of Ukraine, was allegedly stealing anywhere from $186,200 to $259,300 worth of electricity every month. That\u2019s something the building owner meanwhile disputed.The cryptomining operation was set up in a warehouse in the city of Vinnytsia, formerly owned by a company called JSC Vinnytsiaoblenerho, which denies any involvement and refutes any electricity was stolen from the location, according to a translated statement from the company.The operation. Source: Security Service of Ukraine.\u201cDuring the inspection, the representatives of the controlling body did not reveal any facts of theft of electricity,\u201d the company said. \u201cTherefore, the information about the multimillion-dollar theft of electricity is not true. The management of JSC Vinnytsiaoblenergo actively cooperates with the investigation and is interested in establishing all the facts and punishing the perpetrators.\u201dThe Security Service of Ukraine alleges the cryptomining group\u2019s electricity consumption likely led to power surges and outages in the area.In addition to the game consoles, authorities also reported seizing 500 graphics cards, 50 processors, electricity use documents, phones, flash drives and notes.The cryptominers will be charged with \u201c\u2026the theft of water, electricity or thermal energy through its unauthorized use,\u201d according to the SSU.Cryptomining continues to be a popular criminal activity, with new approaches (such as turning to the cloud) cropping up all the time. On Wednesday for instance, a Romanian gang emerged with a Linux-focused campaign.Meanwhile, Ukrainian law enforcement has made a number of high-profile cybersecurity arrests in recent months, most notably the raid of the Clop ransomware group\u2019s operation.

        "raw text": "Researchers have uncovered an ongoing spear-phishing campaign, targeting the Ukraine government and military with emails aiming to distribute the RatVermin malware, which carries out various info-gathering activities.Researchers said that an infrastructure analysis of the attack indicates that the actors behind the intrusion activity may be associated with the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic (also known as the Lugansk People\u2019s Republic or LPR),\u00a0a proto-state in eastern Ukraine which declared independence from Ukraine in 2014.\u201cThis actor has likely been active since at least 2014, and its continuous targeting of the Ukrainian government suggests a cyber-espionage motivation,\u201d\u00a0John Hultquist, Ben Read, Oleg Bondarenko and Chi-en Shen,\u00a0researchers with FireEye\u2019s Threat Intelligence research group, said in a Tuesday analysis. \u201cThis is supported by the ties to the so-called LPR\u2019s security service. While more evidence is needed for definitive attribution, this activity showcases the accessibility of competent cyber-espionage capabilities, even to sub-state actors.\u201dThe campaign was recently spotted targeting government entities in Ukraine via emails containing malicious LNK files with PowerShell scripts, which then downloaded a second-stage payload.Researchers said they spotted a sample email from the campaign sent Jan. 22 with the subject \u201cSPEC-20T-MK2-000-ISS-4.10-09-2018-STANDARD.\u201dThe sender pretended to be from Armtrac, a U.K-based defense manufacturer, purporting to be selling de-mining machines. The email included an attachment called \u201cArmtrac-Commercial.7z,\u201d which contained two harmless Armtrac documents (which were real documents from the official Armtrac website) and one malicious LNK file (with a substituted Microsoft Word icon to trick the victim).Click to EnlargeThe malicious LNK file when clicked on executes a PowerShell script, which then sends a command request to download a second-stage payload.While the server was unreachable during analysis, researchers found that the network infrastructure was linked to domains previously connected to the RatVermin remote access tool (RAT). The RAT is a .NET backdoor discovered in 2018 that performs an array of malicious spy functions, including capturing screenshots, audio and more.The so-called\u00a0LPR proto-state, which is a land-locked territory in eastern Ukraine, \u00a0declared independence from Ukraine after the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. The conflict between the two is still going on as of April 2019.The researchers made a link to LPR because the domain used by the command-and-control (C2) server in the campaign was registered under the same email (re2a1er1@yandex[.]ru) as several other domains \u2013 including one for the official website of the Ministry of State Security of the Luhansk People\u2019s Republic.Other domains linked to the email include several ones mimicking large news portals in Ukraine, one mimicking the site of V. B. Groysman (a politician who has been the Prime Minister of Ukraine since April 14, 2016) and one mimicking the largest weather website in the country.It\u2019s not the first time the Ukraine government has been targeted by a cyberattack \u2013 in April 2018, for instance, the\u00a0Ukrainian Energy Ministry was hit by a ransomware attack, in what researchers believed was the work of amateurs rather than cyber-espionage efforts. Other efforts however have shown more skill.\u201cThis latest activity is a continuation of spear-phishing that targeted the Ukrainian government as early as 2014,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe email is linked to activity that previously targeted the Ukrainian Government with RatVermin.

        "raw text": "The massive NotPetya ransomware outbreak that crippled organizations around the world last year turns out to have links to the Industroyer backdoor, which targets industrial control systems (ICS) and took down the Ukrainian power grid in Kiev in 2016.In fact, the same threat actor \u2013 dubbed TeleBots (a.k.a. Sandworm) by ESET researchers \u2013 appears to be behind NotPetya, the 2015 BlackEnergy attack that also caused blackouts in Ukraine, and the Industroyer campaign a year later.NotPetya (a.k.a. ExPetr) broke out last June, and was initially believed to be another global ransomware attack on par with WannaCry \u2013 but it turned out to be a wiper in disguise. While the malware has a ransomware component, NotPetya can\u2019t decrypt victims\u2019 disk, even if a payment is made.It claimed thousands of victims worldwide, including some of the highest-profile manufacturers, critical infrastructure providers and financial services organizations \u2013 tying up giants like the Merck pharmaceutical company and Maersk, the shipping behemoth.According to ESET analysts Anton Cherepanov and Robert Lipovsky, the BlackEnergy malware responsible for the 2015 Ukraine blackout contains the same KillDisk encryption component seen in the NotPetya malware, which is a hallmark of the TeleBots group.\u201cIn the final stage of its attacks, the TeleBots group always used the KillDisk malware to overwrite files with specific file extensions on the victims\u2019 disks,\u201d they wrote last year. They also discovered that the outbreak started spreading from companies afflicted with a TeleBots backdoor, resulting from the compromise of the financial software M.E.Doc, popular in Ukraine.Meanwhile, Industroyer (a.k.a. Crash Override) is the code used in attacks against the Ukrainian power grid in Dec. 2016. That attack and the 2015 BlackEnergy offensive targeted the same Ukrainian networks (and together, the 2015 and 2016 incidents are considered the only successful hacks of an energy grid to date); however, no hard evidence has been seen to tie the two to the same APT until ESET researchers this year uncovered strong code similarities, tying them both to TeleBots through an analysis of a recent backdoor.In fact, TeleBots\u2019 latest malware, dubbed Win32/Exaramel, shows it to be an improved version of the Industroyer backdoor. It was detected at an organization in Ukraine (though not an industrial facility), exfiltrating information. It copies files, automatically compresses and encrypts them and sends them off to the command-and-control (C2) server; and it\u2019s being used with some of TeleBots\u2019 older tools, including a custom password stealer, and a slightly-modified Mimikatz.A closer look under the hood revealed there are several aspects in the code that show it to be closely related to Industroyer.For one, the Win32/Exaramel backdoor is initially deployed by a dropper, they found, which starts a Windows service named \u201cwsmprovav,\u201d with the description \u201cWindows Check AV\u201d.\u201cAs can be seen from the first line of the configuration, the attackers are grouping their targets based on the security solutions in use,\u201d ESET researchers said in a posting last week. \u201cSimilar behavior can be found in the Industroyer toolset \u2013 specifically some of the Industroyer backdoors were also disguised as an AV-related service (deployed under the name avtask.exe) and used the same grouping.\u201dOnce the backdoor is running, it connects to its C2 server and receives various commands to be executed. The code of the command loop and implementations of the first six commands (launch process, launch process under specified Windows user, write data to a file in specified path, copy file into storage sub-directory (Upload file), execute shell command and execute shell command as specified Windows user) are very similar to those found in a backdoor used in the Industroyer toolset, according to ESET.Both malware families also use a report file for storing the resulting output of executed shell commands and launched processes.\u201cIn case of the Win32/Industroyer backdoor, the report file is stored in a temporary folder under a random filename,\u201d the team explained. \u201cIn the case of the Win32/Exaramel backdoor, the report file is named report.txt and its storage path is defined in the backdoor\u2019s configuration file.\u201dThere are other similarities. For instance, in order to redirect standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) to the report file, both backdoors set the hStdOutput and hStdError parameters to a handle of the report file.Meanwhile, the main difference between the backdoor from the Industroyer toolset and the new TeleBots backdoor is that the latter uses XML format for communication and configuration instead of a custom binary format.\u201cThe discovery of Exaramel shows that the TeleBots group is still active in 2018 and the attackers keep improving their tools and tactics,\u201d ESET researchers said. \u201cThe strong code similarity between the Win32/Exaramel backdoor and the Industroyer main backdoor is the first publicly-presented evidence linking Industroyer to TeleBots, and hence to NotPetya and BlackEnergy. While the possibility of false flags \u2013 or a coincidental code sharing by another threat actor \u2013 should always be kept in mind when attempting attribution, in this case we consider it unlikely.\u201dWhile ESET declined to attempt nation-state attribution for the TeleBots APT, Phil Neray, vice president of Industrial Cybersecurity at CyberX, said that he believes Russian intelligence to be behind this hat-trick of destructive incidents.\u201cThe ESET report is significant because it ties a single group of GRU threat actors to several major cyberattacks, including the first Ukrainian grid attack in 2015 (BlackEnergy), the second grid attack in 2016 (Industroyer), and NotPetya which disabled production facilities worldwide in 2017 and has been called the most devastating cyberattack in history,\u201d he said via email.Critical InfrastructureEditor's PicksGovernmentHacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Pro-Ukraine security researcher @ContiLeaks yesterday uploaded a fresher version of Conti ransomware than they had previously released \u2013 specifically, the source code for Conti Ransomware V3.0 \u2013 to VirusTotal.ContiLeaks posted a link to the code on Twitter. The code includes a compiled locker and decryptor, according to vx-underground, which has been archiving the leaks.The archive is password-protected, but the password is easy to figure out, according to replies to ContiLeaks\u2019 release.source conti v3.  https://t.co/1dcvWYpsp7\u2014 conti leaks (@ContiLeaks) March 20, 2022ContiLeaks followed up in a few hours by thumbing their nose at the pro-Russia law enforcement that the researcher said is looking for them in the UA \u2013 in other words, in Ukraine.\u201ci can tell you good luck mf!\u201d ContiLeaks tweeted, using another acronym that probably doesn\u2019t need explaining.\n\nCrap Code?The code is apparently legitimate.BleepingComputer compiled the newly released source code for Version 3 of Conti ransomware without any issues, successfully creating the gang\u2019s executables for encrypting and decrypting files.But just because it works doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an improvement, some said.After analyzing the source code, Payload \u2013 a Polish magazine about offensive IT security \u2013\u00a0 dismissed Version 3 as being a \u201cgiant step back\u201d from Version 2 in terms of code quality.Maybe the changes between versions were done by a flunky dev, Payload suggested in its response to vx-underground. \u201cWe analyzed it. There is [\u2026] very little improvement, and giant step back in terms of source code quality. Most probably these changes were made by someone else than original developer.\u201dFor those who are combing through Conti code, you\u2019re better off sticking with the \u201ccleaner\u201d 2.0, Payload suggested. \u201cBut definitely: if anyone wants to learn anything from this code, please move to Conti 2.0, it\u2019s a lot cleaner and overall better to start with,\u201d Payload said.Ross Williams, director of digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) at managed detection and response (MDR) services provider CRITICALSTART, told Threatpost on Monday that from a DFIR perspective,\u00a0 these leaks give security professionals and responders \u201cinsight into the gang\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures as well as indicators of compromise.\u201d The information enables them \u201cto identify a breach or infection more quickly and to thereby slow the spread of ransomware,\u201d Williams said via email.It also gives anyone with the motivation and skillset to penetrate a network the tools they need to create their own ransomware gang: The criminally inclined can just use the Conti software along with its training manuals, which were also leaked, noted BreachQuest Head of Product Marco Figueroa.With all this access to Conti code, tools and tactics, a hit from \u201cConti\u201d could be close to a hit from \u201cyour guess is as good as mine.\u201d\u201cI believe the only way to verify that a victim was hit with \u2018Sterns Conti gang\u2019 is by tracking the payment to bitcoin addresses,\u201d Figueroa said. \u201cStern\u201d is a reference to the name used by one of the Conti group\u2019s top managers.The Conti Gutting ContinuesThis is just the latest in a series of leaks following ContiLeaks\u2019 promise to eviscerate the Conti group \u2013 a promise of revenge that followed Conti\u2019s having pledged support for the Russian government over its invasion of Ukraine.ContiLeaks\u2019 earlier spills included an older version of Conti ransomware source code \u2013 one that dated to Jan. 25, 2021. Version 3.0 \u2013 the one released on Sunday \u2013 is over a year newer.In their earlier leaks, ContiLeaks has also divulged source code for TrickBot malware, a decryptor and the gang\u2019s administrative panels, among other core secrets.The leaks \u2013 an act of revenge wrought upon the cybercrooks who\u2019ve sided with Russia in the war (one among the thousand cuts that have been bleeding Russia as cybercrooks take sides) \u2013 have also included nearly 170,000 chat conversations between the Conti ransomware gang members, covering more than a year from January 2021 through February 2022.It\u2019s a treasure trove that researchers have spent weeks poring over, discovering the inner workings of the extortionists\u2019 dark business, its top brass and far more.For example, a clear picture of Conti company culture has arisen from the leaks. For one thing, it\u2019s run like a legit high-tech company, offering bonuses, employee-of-the-month and other such benefits, researchers say. Chat logs also have shown that bored top management have mulled working on something new: say, Conti\u2019s own altcoin alternative to Bitcoin.New Conti Affiliate DiscoveredIn related news, on Monday, eSentire\u2019s Threat Research Unit (TRU) published a report about a new Conti affiliate group. The report details new accounts, specific IP addresses, domain names and Protonmail email accounts linked to the affiliate, Indicators of Compromise that organizations should address immediately, an overview of attack vectors, and how the affiliate is \u2013 like so many criminals \u2013 abusing the Cobalt Strike intrusion framework for attack purposes.eSentire\u2019s report details one such Cobalt Strike incident, nicknamed ShadowBeacon, during which the Cobalt beacons were being deployed from the domain controllers via PsExec: a legitimate admin tool used for remotely executing binaries.Together with BreakPoint Labs (BPL), TRU observed threat actors leveraging the Cobalt Strike infrastructure to attack seven different U.S. companies between 2021 and 2022. According to eSentire, victims included companies in the financial, environmental, legal and charitable sectors.\u201cThe Windows logs revealed that the threat actor had been able to register their own virtual machine on the victim organization\u2019s network,\u201d the report noted, \u201cusing it as a pivot to their actual, exterior [command-and-control, aka C2, server].\u201dData in Motion Most at Risk in Ransomware AttacksTo protect from ransomware attacks, Rajiv Pimplaskar, CEO of the VPN company Dispersive Holdings, told Threatpost on Monday that organizations should look beyond protecting data at rest: the data that\u2019s at risk of getting paralyzed in a ransomware attack. \u201cInformation is most vulnerable for a data breach or malware infection\u201d when it\u2019s in motion, the CEO cautioned.\u201cNetwork resources are prime targets for Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) actors as they can be ideal vectors for insider threats, code and injection attacks, Man In The Middle (MITM), privilege escalation as well as lateral movement,\u201d Pimplaskar said via email.Pimplaskar suggested that, beyond establishing proper access control and device posture checking to prevent unauthorized access, \u201cnetwork security must also be bolstered with advanced capabilities such as managed attribution and active data multi-pathing. These capabilities obfuscate network soft targets as well as keep data secure from hostile detection and interception.\u201d032122 14:90 UPDATE: Added input from Ross Williams.032122 16:43 UPDATE: Added input from Marco Figueroa.032122 18:05 Corrected explanation of UA: It is, in fact, the two-letter acronym for Ukraine.Moving to the cloud?

So far, the affected areas include the Black Sea airspace, Eastern Finland, the Kaliningrad region and other Baltic areas, and the Eastern Mediterranean area near Cyprus, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria and Israel, as well as Northern Iraq.\u201cThe effects of [Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)] jamming and/or possible spoofing were observed by aircraft in various phases of their flights, in certain cases leading to re-routing or even to change the destination due to the inability to perform a safe landing procedure,\u201d EASA warned (PDF). \u201cUnder the present conditions, it is not possible to predict GNSS outages and their effects.\u201dLosing a GNSS signal could result in many negative outcomes, including pilots \u201cflying blind,\u201d without the use of waypoint navigation to tell where they are. Outages could also affect the ability for an airplane\u2019s instrumentation to accurately track the aircraft\u2019s position, which could lead to a plane entering contested airspace; the inability to properly gauge one\u2019s proximity to the ground (which could trigger pull-up commands, according to the alert); or the failure of systems that address dangers like wind shear.\u201cThe magnitude of the issues generated by such outage would depend upon the extent of the area concerned, on the duration and on the phase of flight of the affected aircraft,\u201d EASA warned.The agency urged air operators to make sure that fall-back conventional navigation infrastructure is fully operational onboard the aircraft, and to ensure reliable surveillance coverage that is resilient to GNSS interference, such as ground-based navigational aids (i.e., Distance Measuring Equipment or DME, and Very High Frequency omnidirectional range or VOR).\u201cVerify the aircraft position by means of conventional navigation aids when flights are operated in proximity of the affected areas; check that the navigation aids critical to the operation for the intended route and approach are available; and remain prepared to revert to a conventional arrival procedure where appropriate and inform air traffic controllers in such a case,\u201d EASA recommended. \u201cEnsure, in the flight planning and execution phase, the availability of alternative conventional arrival and approach procedures (i.e. an aerodrome in the affected area with only GNSS approach procedure should not be considered as destination or alternate).\u201dCISA Warns on Satellite Network HackingThe concerns over the hacking of satellite systems in general also began Feb. 24, when Ukrainian official reported that hackers had apparently compromised one of the nation\u2019s satellite systems. According to Reuters, the attack made communication with the Viasat KA-SAT satellite impossible, which resulted in internet outages across Europe, with tens of thousands of people cut off.The cyberattackers took advantage of a misconfigured management interface for the satellite network, Viasat said.The National Security Agency is looking into whether the attack was carried out by Russian state-sponsored actors, according to the report.This week, CISA tersely warned that it is \u201caware of possible threats to U.S. and international satellite communication (SATCOM) networks. Successful intrusions into SATCOM networks could create risk in SATCOM network providers\u2019 customer environments.\u201dThe agency advised satellite operators to start monitoring at ingress and egress points for anomalous traffic, including the use of various remote access tools (Telnet, FTP, SSH and so on); connections out to \u201cunexpected\u201d network segments; unauthorized use of local or backup accounts; unexpected traffic to terminals or closed-group SATCOM networks; and brute-force login attempts.Satellite customers meanwhile should implement multifactor authentication (MFA) on their accounts, CISA warned, and should shore up least-privilege approaches for any sensitive areas served by satellite links.Andreas Galauner, lead security researcher at Rapid7, noted that in the U.S., critical infrastructure is likely the target for such attacks.\u201cAlmost no private individual uses SATCOM, as it is costly and the latency is too high and slow,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThis leaves industrial and critical infrastructures, which makes SATCOM an appealing target.\u201dJames McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, made a similar assessment.\u201cCommunication is a critical element needed in life these days, whether between families or between governments,\u201d he emailed. \u201cIf the ability to communicate is lost, it becomes challenging to strategize, coordinate or plan. When cybercriminals are targeting this element of critical infrastructure, cyber-resiliency is essential to remain in contact. Organizations working with SATCOM products or services need to ensure protections to secure access to the devices with multi-factor authentication. Ensure all systems are up to date with software and firmware updates, increase monitoring of traffic and logs, and review incident response plans to prepare for an outage.\u201dISPs of all stripes should be vigilant, Galauner added.\u201cEven though this particular risk relates to satellite communication networks, this has happened before in \u2018normal\u2019 ISPs,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those instances, what got \u2018pwned\u2019 is the CPE: modems and routers that weren\u2019t configured properly by the ISP. This could happen on DSL and cable lines as much as it can happen here. However, a satellite network, possibly spanning huge geographical areas, might allow attackers to perform more widespread attacks without having to be in the physical vicinity.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday announced charges against six Russian nationals who are allegedly tied to the Sandworm APT. The threat group is believed to have launched several high-profile cyberattacks over the past few years \u2013 including the destructive NotPetya cyberattack that targeted hundreds of firms and hospitals worldwide in 2017.According to the DOJ complaint, the six Russian nationals are tied to a division of the Russian military intelligence service and also affiliated with the APT Sandworm, also known as TeleBots. The DOJ said cyberattacks linked to the six defendants were \u201cbreathtaking\u201d in their scope and \u201charmed ordinary people around the world,\u201d said Scott Brady, U.S. attorney with the Western District of Pennsylvania, in a DOJ press conference on Monday.The six defendants are: Yuriy Sergeyevich Andrienko (32); Sergey Vladimirovich Detistov (35); Pavel Valeryevich Frolov (28); Anatoliy Sergeyevich Kovalev (29); Artem Valeryevich Ochichenko (27) and Petr Nikolayevich Pliskin (32).A breakdown of the charges against each defendant. Credit: DoJEach were charged in seven counts: conspiracy to conduct computer fraud and abuse, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, damaging protected computers, and aggravated identity theft, according to the DOJ.According to the DOJ, the alleged malicious activity of the six dates back to November 2015, with the group developing malware known as BlackEnergy, Industroyer and KillDisk. The group used the malware in attacks against Ukraine\u2019s electric power grid, Ministry of Finance, and State Treasury Service from Dec. 2015 to Dec. 2016, according to the DOJ.In April and May 2017 the group allegedly launched spearphishing campaigns targeting French President Macron\u2019s \u201cLa R\u00e9publique En Marche!\u201d (En Marche!) political party prior to the 2017 French elections.The six defendants. Credit: DoJThey were also allegedly behind the June 2017 destructive malware attacks that infected computers worldwide, using the NotPetya malware, resulting in the infection of 400 computers. The malware crippled many critical systems, including mission critical systems used by hospitals like the Pennsylvania-based Heritage Valley Health Systems.In February 2018, the group allegedly sent spearphishing campaigns and malicious mobile applications targeting South Korean citizens and officials, Olympic athletes, partners, and visitors, and International Olympic Committee (IOC) officials; they then allegedly compromised computers supporting the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games. This led to the Feb. 9, 2018, destructive malware attack against the opening ceremony, using malware known as Olympic Destroyer.Finally, the group is alleged to have sent spearphishing emails to government organizations investigating the poisoning of a former GRU officer and his daughter in the United Kingdom in April 2018; and to have targeted the country of Georgia in 2018 with a spearphishing attack that led to the defacement of 15,000 websites.\u201cGroups like this use tactics, such as spearphishing, that are just as likely to reach targets on both computers, smartphones, or tablets,\u201d Hank Schless, Senior Manager, Security Solutions at Lookout, told Threatpost.\u00a0\u201cThey know that the likelihood of a successful phishing attack increases dramatically if the target receives it on a mobile device.\u00a0They can phish login credentials from particular users that would allow them to get into the corporate infrastructure, then move laterally around the infrastructure for surveillance purposes or to exfiltrate valuable data.\u201dThreat researchers applauded the crackdown, saying that, while the arrest and extraction of the six Russian nationals seems unlikely, the indictments will limit their ability to use the Western financial system or travel to any country that may have an extradition agreement with the US.\u201cThe charges filed against Sandworm represent not only the first criminal charges against Sandworm for its most destructive attacks but the first time that most of the charged threat actors have been publicly identified as members of the cybercriminal group,\u201d Kacey Clark, Threat Researcher at Digital Shadows, told Threatpost. \u201cThey also represent Sandworm\u2019s first global law enforcement reaction to their deployment of the NotPetya ransomware that has crippled networks worldwide.\u201dGoogle\u2019s \u00a0Threat Analysis Group (TAG), Cisco\u2019s Talos Intelligence Group, Facebook and Twitter were credited in helping the DOJ with its investigation.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Malware called VPNFilter has infected 500,000 router brands ranging from Linksys, MikroTik, NETGEAR and TP-Link that are mostly used in home offices. Researchers at Cisco Talos said they decided to warn the public of the threat despite the fact the infected devices and malware are still under investigation.Researchers said their investigation into VPNFilter has been over the last several months and included both law enforcement and private-sector intelligence partners. \u201cWe have not completed our research, but recent events have convinced us that the correct way forward is to now share our findings so that affected parties can take the appropriate action to defend themselves,\u201d researchers wrote in a Wednesday\u00a0post.Talos believes the attacks are being perpetrated by state-sponsored or state-affiliated actors and that an attack leveraging those compromised devices could be \u201cimminent.\u201d Researchers can\u2019t say for sure who is behind VPNFilter, but say code used by the malware authors overlap with BlackEnergy malware used in previous attacks in the Ukraine. Currently, VPNFilter malware has been found mostly on devices in the Ukraine, but also in 54 additional countries.\u201cThe behavior of this malware on networking equipment is particularly concerning, as components of the VPNFilter malware allows for theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols,\u201d researchers wrote.Researchers said the malware has destructive capabilities that allow an attacker to either infect a device or render it unusable. \u201c[This] can be triggered on individual victim machines or en masse, and has the potential of cutting off internet access for hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide,\u201d the report stated.More troubling to researchers, as of Thursday they \u201cobserved another substantial increase in newly acquired VPNFilter victims focused in Ukraine.\u201dThe malware itself is multi-staged with phase one including VPNFilter targeting a number of CPU architectures of devices running firmware based on Busybox and Linux.\u201cThe main purpose of these first-stage binaries is to locate a server providing a more fully featured second stage, and to download and maintain persistence for this next stage on infected devices,\u201d Talos wrote.Researchers said that this method of achieving persistence differs from other similar IoT malware such as Mirai. The Mirai malware could be removed from a device with a simple reboot. VPNFilter, on the other hand, \u201cis capable of modifying non-volatile configuration memory values and adds itself to crontab, the Linux job scheduler, to achieve persistence,\u201d according to the report.After the malware has burrowed its way into a system\u2019s memory, it begins to download an image from the image hosting site Photobucket, or from the domain toknowall[.]com as a backup. From the image downloaded, the malware extracts an IP address embedded in the image\u2019s EXIF metadata that is used as a \u201clistener\u201d for the malware to receive instructions to initiate stage two.\u201cThe stage 2 malware first sets up the working environment by creating a modules folder (/var/run/vpnfilterm) and a working directory (/var/run/vpnfilterw). Afterward, it will run in a loop, where it first reaches out to a C2 server, and then executes commands retrieved from the C2,\u201d researchers wrote.Malicious capabilities of VPNFilter include bricking the host device, executing shell commands for further manipulation, creating a ToR configuration for anonymous access to the device, or maliciously configuring the router\u2019s proxy port and proxy URL to manipulate browsing sessions.A third stage of the malware has also been observed where attackers leverage as many as two plugin modules \u2013 a packet sniffer and a communication plugin. Both leverage ToR to cloak communications.\u00a0The packet sniffer module is capable of intercepting network traffic through a \u201craw socket\u201d and looks for strings used in HTTP basic authentications. \u201cThis allows the attackers to understand, capture, and track the traffic flowing through the device,\u201d researchers said.Links made to the Russian-speaking actors with the BlackEnergy APT group were made when Cisco Talos researchers closely examined the malware\u2019s encrypted binaries. \u201cAnalysis of this RC4 implementation shows that it is identical to the implementation used in BlackEnergy, which is believed by law enforcement agencies to originate with a state actor,\u201d researchers stated.\u201cVPNFilter is an expansive, robust, highly capable, and dangerous threat that targets devices that are challenging to defend. Its highly modular framework allows for rapid changes to the actor\u2019s operational infrastructure, serving their goals of misattribution, intelligence collection, and finding a platform to conduct attacks,\u201d Talos researchers said.FeaturedGovernmentHacksMalwarePrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Kaiser Permanente suffered a data breach due to email compromise on April 5 that potentially exposed the medical records of nearly 70,000 patients, the company revealed earlier this month.Attackers gained access to the emails of an employee at Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington that contained \u201cprotected health information,\u201d the company revealed in a letter to affected clients on June 3.The attacker maintained unauthorized access for several hours, after which Kaiser terminated the activity \u201cand promptly commenced an investigation to determine the scope of the incident,\u201d according to the letter.However, even Kaiser wasn\u2019t completely sure if attackers gained access to personal health information of clients due to the breach, though the company acknowledged that it is \u201cunable to completely rule out the possibility.\u201dSo far, the company said it has no evidence of \u201cidentity theft or misuse of protected health information\u201d as a result of the breach.In addition to Kaiser\u2019s own investigation, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights also is currently looking into the breach, according to a listing on its website that claims that the incident affected 69,589 individuals.Quicker Response?One security professional noted that while it was \u201cproactive\u201d of Kaiser Permanente to notify such a large group clients about the breach, the company\u2019s uncertainty about whether data was stolen or not may indicate a lack of sufficient incident response on its part.\u201cIt demonstrates the need for organizations to have robust auditing controls to quickly identify what data was accessed by attackers during an incident,\u201d observed Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at cybersecurity company Cerberus Sentinel, in an email to Threatpost.He also noted that the company could have acted faster to notify those potentially affected, as three months is plenty of time for attackers to take advantage of the breach.\u201cDuring this time, the affected individuals could have been targeted by attackers using any specific information stolen in convincing social engineering campaigns,\u201d Clements said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s critical that as a part of their larger cybersecurity culture organizations include assessing their ability to quickly understand the scope of a potential breach in risk analysis or tabletop exercises.\u201dHuman Error Still a Security PlagueThe incident also once again sheds light on what has always been and remains the biggest security risk that organizations face\u2014human error.Verizon\u2019s 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), a comprehensive look at data breaches that occurred in the previous year, found that 82 percent of the breaches analyzed last year involved what researchers call \u201cthe human element,\u201d which can be any number of things.\u201cWhether it is the use of stolen credentials, phishing, misuse, or simply an error, people continue to play a very large role in incidents and breaches alike,\u201d researchers wrote in the report.Business email compromise (BEC), which is what appears to have occurred in the Kaiser breach, is an especially significant threat. Attackers have become increasingly sophisticated in crafting socially engineered phishing and other malicious email campaigns, which dupe unsuspecting employees into giving up credentials to their business email accounts.This can lead to further nefarious activities once a threat actor has gained initial access to a company network, such as ransomware or other financially motivated cybercrimes.In fact, BEC has become a major financial drain for organizations, with the FBI reporting recently that companies spent $43 billion between June 2016 and December 2021 due to this type of attack. In fact, between July 2019 and December 2021 alone there was a 65 percent spike in BEC scams, which the FBI attributed mainly to the pandemic forcing most business activity to occur online.BreachPrivacy",

        "raw text": "EdFinancial and the Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) are notifying over 2.5 million loanees that their personal data was exposed in a data breach.The target of the breach was Nelnet Servicing, the Lincoln, Neb.-based servicing system and web portal provider for OSLA and EdFinancial, according to a breach disclosure letter.Nelnet revealed the breach to affected loan recipients on July 21, 2022 via a letter.\u201c[Our] cybersecurity team took immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched[sic] an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity,\u201d according to the letter.By August 17th, the investigation determined that personal user information was accessed by an unauthorized party. That exposed information included names, home addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and social security numbers for a total of 2,501,324 student loan account holders. Users\u2019 financial information was not exposed.According to a breach disclosure filing submitted by Nelnet\u2019s general counsel, Bill Munn, to the state of Maine the breach occurred sometime between June 1, 2022 and July 22, 2022. However, a letter to affected customers pinpoints the breach to July 21. The breach was discovered on August 17, 2022.\u201cOn July 21, 2022, Nelnet Servicing, LLC (Nelnet), our servicing system and customer websiteportal provider, notified us that they had discovered a vulnerability that we believe led to this incident,\u201d according to the Nelnet.It\u2019s unclear what the vulnerability was.\u201cOn August 17, 2022, this investigation determined that certain student loan account registration information was accessible by an unknown party beginning in June 2022 and ending on July 22, 2022,\u201d according to the letter.Loan Recipient Targets Although users\u2019 most sensitive financial data was protected, the personal information that was accessed in the Nelnet breach \u201chas potential to be leveraged in future social engineering and phishing campaigns,\u201d explained Melissa Bischoping, endpoint security research specialist at Tanium, in a statement via email.\u201cWith recent news of student loan forgiveness, it\u2019s reasonable to expect the occasion to be used by scammers as a gateway for criminal activity,\u201d Bischoping said.Last week, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for low- and middle-income loanees. She said the loan forgiveness program will be used to lure victims into opening up phishing emails.She warns that recently breached data will be used to impersonate affected brands in waves of phishing campaigns targeting students and recent college graduates.\u201cBecause they can leverage the trust from existing business relationships they can be particularly deceptive,\u201d she wrote.According to the breach disclosure Nelnet Servicing informed Edfinancial and OSLA that Nelnet Servicing\u2019s cybersecurity team \u201ctook immediate action to secure the information system, block the suspicious activity, fix the issue, and launched an investigation with third-party forensic experts to determine the nature and scope of the activity.\u201dRemediation also included two years of free credit monitoring, credit reports and up to $1 million in identity theft insurance.Breach",

        "raw text": "Cisco Systems revealed details of a May hack by the Yanluowang ransomware group that leveraged a compromised employee\u2019s Google account.The networking giant is calling the attack a \u201cpotential compromise\u201d in a Wednesday post by the company\u2019s own Cisco Talos threat research arm.\u201cDuring the investigation, it was determined that a Cisco employee\u2019s credentials were compromised after an attacker gained control of a personal Google account where credentials saved in the victim\u2019s browser were being synchronized,\u201d wrote Cisco Talos in a lengthy breakdown of the attack.Forensic details of the attack lead Cisco Talos researchers to attribute the attack to the Yanluowang threat group, which they maintain has ties to both the UNC2447 and the notorious Lapsus$ cybergangs.Ultimately, Cisco Talos said the adversaries were not successful at deploying ransomware malware, however were successful at penetrating its network and planting a cadre of offensive hacking tools and conducting internal network reconnaissance\u00a0 \u201ccommonly observed leading up to the deployment of ransomware in victim environments.\u201dOutsmarting MFA for VPN AccessThe crux of the hack was the attackers ability to compromise the targeted employee\u2019s Cisco VPN utility and access the corporate network using that VPN software.\u201cInitial access to the Cisco VPN was achieved via the successful compromise of a Cisco employee\u2019s personal Google account. The user had enabled password syncing via Google Chrome and had stored their Cisco credentials in their browser, enabling that information to synchronize to their Google account,\u201d wrote Cisco Talos.With credentials in their possession, attackers then used a multitude of techniques to bypass the multifactor authentication tied to the VPN client. Efforts included voice phishing and a type of attack called MFA fatigue. Cisco Talos describes the MFA fatigue attack technique as \u201cthe process of sending a high volume of push requests to the target\u2019s mobile device until the user accepts, either accidentally or simply to attempt to silence the repeated push notifications they are receiving.\u201dThe MFA spoofing attacks leveraged against Cisco employee were ultimately successfully and allowed the attackers to run the VPN software as the targeted Cisco employee. \u201cOnce the attacker had obtained initial access, they enrolled a series of new devices for MFA and authenticated successfully to the Cisco VPN,\u201d researchers wrote.\u201cThe attacker then escalated to administrative privileges, allowing them to login to multiple systems, which alerted our Cisco Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), who subsequently responded to the incident,\u201d they said.Tools used by attackers included LogMeIn and TeamViewer and also offensive security tools such as Cobalt Strike, PowerSploit, Mimikatz and Impacket.While MFA is considered an essential security posture for organizations, it is far from hack-proof. Last month, Microsoft researchers uncovered a massive\u00a0phishing\u00a0campaign that can steal credentials even if a user has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled and has so far attempted to compromise more than 10,000 organizations.Cisco Highlights its Incident ResponseIn response to the attack, Cisco implemented a company-wide password reset immediately, according to the Cisco Talos report.\u201cOur findings and subsequent security protections resulting from those customer engagements helped us slow and contain the attacker\u2019s progression,\u201d they wrote.The company then created two Clam AntiVirus signatures (Win.Exploit.Kolobko-9950675-0\u00a0 \u00a0and Win.Backdoor.Kolobko-9950676-0) as a precaution to disinfect any possible additional compromised assets. Clam AntiVirus Signatures (or ClamAV) is a cross-platform antimalware toolkit able to detect a variety of malware and viruses.\u201cThreat actors commonly use social engineering techniques to compromise targets, and despite the frequency of such attacks, organizations continue to face challenges mitigating those threats. User education is paramount in thwarting such attacks, including making sure employees know the legitimate ways that support personnel will contact users so that employees can identify fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information,\u201d Cisco Talos wrote.\u00a0BreachHacks",

It\u2019s already notified the victimized companies, the company said.Threatpost asked HubSpot for a full list of affected HubSpot cryptocurrency customers, as well as confirmation of what superpowers its super admins have over customer data stored in the customer relationship management (CRM) platform. It responded by referring to one of those \u201cwe\u2019ve been breached\u201d canned statements that breached companies tend to put out: namely, \u201c\u200b\u200bWe take the privacy of our customers and their data incredibly seriously.\u201d\u2018Bad Actor\u2019 Has Been CannedHubSpot said that it learned on Friday that a \u201cbad actor\u201d had compromised a HubSpot employee account \u2013 namely, what sounds like one of the \u2018super admin\u2019 accounts HubSpot has on both internal and external sides of its platform, according to another HubSpot super admin \u2013 and that the attack was focused on stealing data from its cryptocurrency industry customers.\u201cWe have terminated access for the compromised HubSpot employee account and removed the ability for other employees to take certain actions in customer accounts.\u201d \u2014HubSpotThe rogue employee was attempting to access contact data, HubSpot said. CMS Wire reported that HubSpot handed over details about the employee\u2019s actions to affected customers.Data Stolen That Never Should Have Been ThereOn Saturday, the day after HubSpot reported the breach, Swan Bitcoin reassured customers that it uses HubSpot for \u201climited client communication and marketing data,\u201d not for financial information, transactions, or other sensitive personal or financial information.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Swan reassured customers: \u201cYour funds are safe. Your Bitcoin is not at risk.\u201dYesterday, Hubspot, a third-party marketing vendor, confirmed a bad actor within their company gained access to Swan client marketing data.Read Cory\u2019s email to clients in the attached screenshots for details.We\u2019ll keep you updated. pic.twitter.com/qtXVk5AOW8\u2014 Swan Bitcoin (@SwanBitcoin) March 19, 2022At least initially, it looked like data swept up in the breach was limited to names, emails, account types, phone numbers and, in some cases, company names, Swan said. The exfiltrated data didn\u2019t include Social Security numbers, tax IDs, birth dates, government IDs, bitcoin addresses or balances, according to Swan CEO Cory Klippstein.But as of Tuesday, the situation looked a bit more grim, as Swan followed up with more details uncovered in its forensic investigation. It turns out that 0.2 percent of the dataset included \u201ca limited historical snapshot of USD deposits,\u201d the company said \u2013 an inclusion that\u2019s \u201cagainst company policy.\u201d The company said that it\u2019s conducted a post-mortem to ensure that the slippage won\u2019t happen again.As well, about 1.2 percent of the dataset included clients\u2019 intended investment areas or the median net worth of their approximate geographic locales.\u201cAll of this sensitive data has been removed from client communications services, Klippstein tweeted.https://twitter.com/SwanBitcoin/status/1506355008127877123/The fact that sensitive financial or personal data weren\u2019t included in the dataset is a positive. But there\u2019s still plenty of damage that can be done with the details that were exfiltrated, security specialists \u2013 and that HubSpot Super Admin \u2013 hastened to point out, starting with social engineering attacks.Just What Data Do CRMs Handle?HubSpot officials told CMS Wire that \u201cSome employees have access to HubSpot accounts,\u201d which allows certain employees \u2013 such as account managers and support specialists \u2013 to help out customers. \u201cIn this case, a bad actor was able to compromise an employee account and make use of this access to export contact data from a small number of HubSpot accounts,\u201d HubSpot reportedly said.In writing for Bitcoin Magazine, HubSpot super admin Robert Warren described exactly what can be done with his level of access rights, which, internally, allows employees to \u201chop between company accounts and export contact lists (and potentially all associated CRM data).\u201d\u201cWhile it is true that financial data is not stored in the CRM, you should be aware that data associated with the users of these companies and their behaviors is logged in the CRM,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cThis puts users in a unique position to be targeted in social engineering attacks.\u201dHe gave the following examples of the types of data that CRM systems can store and which may have been exported in the HubSpot breach:IP addressesEmail histories with representatives at the associated companies and any messages or notes those representatives have on customers and their accountsCustomer browsing behavior on associated company websitesMailing and/or shipping addressesHow customers are characterized internally by companies (\u201cbig buyer,\u201d \u201cwhale,\u201d \u201cmid-sized contact,\u201d \u201csmall user,\u201d etc.)Individual customers\u2019 financial value to companiesAny and all deals customers have done with compromised companies and any associated values, email negotiations or contactsHelp tickets or requests customers have logged with compromised companiesBreach Is \u2018Not Surprising\u2019Camellia Chan, CEO and founder of embedded artificial intelligence (AI) company X-PHY (a Flexxon brand), told Threstpost that given the surge in digital currency development, the breach \u201cisn\u2019t terribly surprising.\u201d\u201cSurges in technological advancement create the perfect environment for cybercrime to flourish,\u201d Chan said. \u201cSo, with the rapid development of digital currencies was sure to come a rise in the cybersecurity risks associated with it.\u201dThe incident spotlights a much wider issue, Chan said: namely, the quantity of sensitive data that these types of organizations store across the enterprise.It \u201cputs not only a specific business at risk, but threatens the potential growth, development, and future success of the entire digital currency industry,\u201d the CEO said.Data Shared with Third-Parties Slips Out of Your HandsChris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at cybersecurity company Cerberus Sentinel, told Threatpost that software-as-a-service (SaaS) and managed service providers are tempting targets, given that cybercriminals know that if they successfully compromise the provider, \u201cthey will likely gain access to the data or networks of hundreds or thousands of the providers\u2019 downstream customers.\u201cIt\u2019s a shortcut to mass exploitation that could otherwise take the attacker months or even years to achieve independently,\u201d Clements said via email.Word to the wise, HubSpot customers. Clements said that it\u2019s \u201cimperative\u201d for organizations to understand that whatever data they share with third-party partners or vendors \u201clargely becomes out of their control and with little recourse should it be stolen if the 3rd party is compromised.\u201dClements advised that all third parties be part of a regularly updated risk analysis based on the level of access or sensitivity of data shared with them.\u201cThe results of the risk analysis should inform a cybersecurity strategy for partner or vendor controls and mitigations to provide higher level of security assurance as is deemed necessary,\u201d he continued.Such assessments should be backed up by mechanisms that verify that third parties are \u201ctaking appropriate steps to provide the needed security assurances and that they can prove it by sharing details about their controls or results of independent validation like a penetration test,\u201d Clements said.\u201d Not all vendors or partners can or will share this with their customers, but it\u2019s critical that in absence of that an organization throw up their hands as if nothing further can be done,\u201d he emphasized.He gave these example of what questions should be covered:Are there controls or safeguards built into the service platform that offer tighter controls or enhanced monitoring capabilities?Are there operational processes that can limit potential data exposure from a breach of a partner like maximum data retention lifetimes?At worst, is it no longer an acceptable risk to continue to do business with the company and to seek out alternatives?\u201cThese are all best practices for cybersecurity 3rd party management, but in order for them to be comprehensively applied, your organization requires a true culture of security that ensures that all external data sharing is evaluated for compliance with its own cybersecurity goals,\u201d he suggested.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Attackers are exploiting a well-known open redirect flaw to phish people\u2019s credentials and personally identifiable information (PII) using American Express and Snapchat domains, researchers have found.Threat actors impersonated Microsoft and FedEx among other brands in two different campaigns, which researchers from INKY observed from mid-May through late July, they said in a blog post published online. Attackers took advantage of redirect vulnerabilities affecting American Express and Snapchat domains, the former of which eventually was patched while the latter still is not, researchers said.\u00a0Open redirect is a security vulnerability that occurs when a website fails to validate user input, which allows bad actors to manipulate the URLs of domains from legitimate entities with good reputations to redirect victims to malicious sites, researchers said. The vulnerability is well known and tracked as CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (\u2018Open Redirect\u2019).\u201cSince the first domain name in the manipulated link is in fact the \u00a0original site\u2019s, the link may appear safe to the casual observer,\u201d INKY\u2019s Roger Kay explained in the post.An example of the malicious redirect domain is: http[://]safe[.]com/redirect?[url=http:]//malicious[.]com. The trusted domain, then\u2014in this case, American Express or Snapchat\u2014is used as a temporary landing page before the victim of the campaign is redirected to a malicious site.During the two-and-a-half-month period over which the campaigns were observed, researchers detected the snapchat[.]com open redirect vulnerability in 6,812 phishing emails originating from various hijacked accounts, they said. Meanwhile, over just two days in late July, they observed the americanexpress[.]com open redirect vulnerability in 2,029 phishing emails that originated from newly created domains.Attack SimilaritiesBoth campaigns started with phishing emails using typical social-engineering tactics to try to trick users into clicking on malicious links or attachments, researchers said.The two campaigns also both used exploits in which attackers inserted PII in the seemingly legitimate URL so that the malicious landing pages could be customized on the fly for the individual victims, they said.\u201cThis insertion was disguised by converting it to Base 64 to make it look like a bunch of random characters,\u201d Kay wrote. \u201cWe inserted our own random characters into these strings so that the casual observer would not be able to reverse engineer the PII strings.\u201dWhen being redirected to another site, victims would think the link was heading somewhere safe; however unbeknownst to them, the domains to which they were being redirected were malicious sites to harvest their credentials or expose them to malware, researchers said.Specific Campaign CharacteristicsThough there were similarities between the two campaigns, there also were tactics specific to each, researchers said.The phishing emails in the Snapchat open redirect group impersonated DocuSign, FedEx and Microsoft, and all had snapchat open redirects that led to Microsoft credential harvesting sites, researchers said.The open redirect vulnerability on the Snapchat domain was unpatched at the time of the campaign and remains so, though Open Bug Bounty reported it to the company on Aug. 4, 2021, Kay noted.The open redirect bug on the American Express domain also appeared unpatched at first, he said. When the phishing campaign using it first started, the open redirect link went to Microsoft credential harvesting sites, researchers observed. However, soon after that, American Express patched the vulnerability, Kay said.\u201cNow, users who click the link end up on a real American Express error page,\u201d he wrote.Simple Mitigation and PreventionBeyond patching open-redirect flaws on their domains, website owners typically don\u2019t give these vulnerabilities the attention they deserve, likely \u201cbecause they don\u2019t allow attackers to harm or steal data from the site,\u201d Kay noted.\u201cFrom the website operator\u2019s perspective, the only damage that potentially occurs is harm to the site\u2019s reputation,\u201d he wrote.If domain owners care to mitigate attacks using open redirect further, they can take a few simple steps, Kay noted. One is pretty obvious: Avoid the implementation of redirection in the site architecture altogether, he said. However, if it\u2019s necessary for commercial reasons, domain owners can implement an allowlist of approved safe links to mitigate open-redirect abuse.Domain owners can also present users with an external redirection disclaimer that requires user clicks before redirecting to external sites, Kay added.As it\u2019s the victims of these campaigns that are the real losers\u2014with the potential to be relieved of credentials, data, and possibly even money\u2014they also should take some steps to protect themselves, he said.When examining links as they browse sites online, people should keep an eye out for URLs that include, for example, \u201curl=,\u201d \u201credirect=,\u201d \u201cexternal-link,\u201d or \u201cproxy.\u201d These strings might indicate that a trusted domain could redirect to another site, Kay noted.Recipients of emails with links also should check them for multiple occurrences of \u201chttp\u201d in the URL, another potential indication of redirection, he said.HacksVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Almost 79,400 MyRepublic mobile subscribers have been caught up in a data breach that exposed a range of personal information, the company has confirmed.The Singapore-based ISP and mobile provider said that an \u201cunauthorized data access incident\u201d took place on August 29. The intrusion in question was aimed at a third-party data storage platform used to store the personal data of MyRepublic\u2019s mobile customers, the firm noted, in a Friday website notice.The affected data includes various forms of proof of identification, the carrier acknowledged:Singapore citizens, permanent residents and employment and dependent pass holders: Scanned copies of both sides of their National Registration Identity Cards (NRICs), which are compulsory identity documents issued to citizens and permanent residents of Singapore. NRICs include names, pictures, dates of birth, addresses, countries of origin, race and gender;Foreign residents: Proof of residential address documents, e.g. scanned copies of a utility bill; which would also include;For customers porting an existing mobile service: Names and mobile numbers.Account numbers and payment information weren\u2019t affected, MyRepublic said, and none of the company\u2019s internal infrastructure was compromised.Setu Kulkarni, vice president of strategy at NTT Application Security, told Threatpost that he had some questions as to how the data was being protected.\u201cBasic confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) principles continue to be ignored resulting in \u2018data incidents\u2019 like this,\u201d Kulkarni said. \u201cWhile this incident is reported as unauthorized data access, which is serious enough, it likely points to an even more serious systemic issue with the way security for this critical data at rest is being implemented.\u201dThis consideration comes into even greater focus when it comes to securing data housed in third-party infrastructure.\u201cAlthough there is an ongoing investigation into the incident, electronic breaches such as this highlight an ominous trend,\u201d Simon Aldama, principal security advisor at Netenrich, told Threatpost. \u201cFifty-one percent of business have endured data breaches caused by threat actors subverting a vendor, partner or suppliers\u2019 infrastructure, the most notable being Accellion, Audi and Volkswagen. The largest reason for this trend is that organizations focus more on post-breach incident, continuity and crisis management rather than pre-breach risk workstreams like asset, vulnerability and threat management.\u201dOrganizations utilizing third parties for sensitive data storage, processing and transfer require accountability through contractual agreements between business-to-business relationships, he added.\u201cManaging vendor and partner risk requires attestations proving they\u2019ve employed risk management practices and proper implementation of technology to protect personally identifiable information such as National Registration Identity Card information,\u201d he noted. \u201cIn the end, financial losses, litigation, and compliance penalties are far greater in cost than the strategic investments required to prevent the incident occurring in the first place.\u201dData Now SecuredThe incident has been contained, MyRepublic said, because \u201cthe unauthorized access to the data storage facility has since been secured. The firm added that it contacted Singapore\u2019s Infocomm Media Development Authority and Personal Data Protection Commission to help get to the bottom of the attack, while tapping KPMG in Singapore to \u201cwork closely with MyRepublic\u2019s internal IT and Network teams to resolve the incident.\u201d\u201cThe privacy and security of our customers are extremely important to us at MyRepublic,\u201d Malcolm Rodrigues, CEO at MyRepublic, said in the website statement. \u201cLike you, we are disappointed with what has happened, and I would like to personally apologize for any inconvenience caused.\u201dHe added, \u201cMy team and I have worked closely with the relevant authorities and expert advisors to secure and contain the incident, and we will continue to support our affected customers every step of the way to help them navigate this issue.\u201dMyRepublic is offering the de rigeur complimentary credit-monitoring service for affected customers, through Credit Bureau Singapore (CBS), and said that it\u2019s reviewing its systems and processes, both internal and external, to shore up any cybersecurity efforts that it needs to.Howard Ting, CEO at Cyberhaven, noted that this last point is critical for the provider moving forward.\u201cThis breach is the latest in a string of examples that highlights how most services today involve a supply chain of vendors that can have access to our data,\u201d Ting told Threatpost. \u201cThis is an important issue for individuals as well as enterprises. Too often, organizations have no visibility behind the curtain into how their service providers handle and protect their data. This demonstrates the need for more transparency and auditability so that customers can know the risk to their data.\u201dIt\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.\u00a0JOIN\u00a0Threatpost and Cybersixgill for\u00a0Threat Hunting to Catch Adversaries, Not Just Stop Attacks\u00a0and get a guided tour of the dark web and learn how to track threat actors before their next attack.\u00a0REGISTER NOW\u00a0for the LIVE discussion on Sept. 22 at 2 p.m. EST with Cybersixgill\u2019s Sumukh Tendulkar and Edan Cohen, along with independent researcher and vCISO Chris Roberts and Threatpost host Becky Bracken.\u00a0BreachCloud SecurityHacks",

        "raw text": "A ransomware attack on the McMenamins dining and hospitality empire in the Pacific Northwest came along with a data breach covering 12 years of employee data, the organization has confirmed.The Dec. 12 incident \u2013 which some have attributed to the Conti gang \u2013 forced McMenamins to shut down various operations, though locations can still receive customers. McMenamins is known for saving and restoring historic buildings throughout Oregon and Washington state and for giving them new lives as eclectic pubs, restaurants, breweries, hotels, movie theaters, concert venues, spas and more. In fact, 20 of its locations are on the National Register of Historic Places.This week, McMenamins confirmed that the cyberattackers made off with internal employee data for those working for the company between the dates of Jan. 1, 1998 and June 30, 2010. The affected data is a bouillabaisse of classic HR fare: names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, ethnicity, gender, disability status, medical notes, performance and disciplinary notes, Social Security numbers, health insurance plan elections, income amounts, and retirement contribution amounts.The data could be sold and/or used for phishing attacks and other social-engineering efforts, identity theft and more.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the thieves accessed files containing direct-deposit bank account information as well, but McMenamins does not have a clear indication they did so,\u201d the company said in a Dec. 30 notice.One ray of promise: No customer data was heisted, the company said.\u201cWe\u2019re devastated our people need to do so, but we\u2019re urging them to vigilantly monitor their accounts and healthcare information for anything unusual,\u201d said Brian McMenamin, one of the brothers who own the business, in a press statement. \u201cThey should immediately notify their financial institutions or health providers if they see anything out of sort. They should sign up immediately for free monitoring and identity-theft protection. All the information is on our website, and we encourage them to call with any questions.\u201dMcMenamins said that it is offering past and current employees identity and credit-protection services, as well as a dedicated call center to answer questions about the attack. Letters have gone out to notify all affected individuals as well.Still Not Recovered from December Ransomware AttackIn the wake of the attack, the company was forced to shut down its IT systems, credit-card point-of-sale systems and corporate email to prevent the further spread of the attack. Three weeks later, the company\u2019s operations are still not remediated, it said, including its central phone system, email, credit-card processing, hotel-reservation system and gift-card processing \u2013 core functions for a hospitality group.For now, the company is asking people to delay their hotel bookings or to call properties directly, and it\u2019s using the third-party Dinerware point-of-sale for credit cards.\u201cIt is unknown when the issue will be resolved and systems back up and running,\u201d the organization said. \u201cGiven the impacts to the company\u2019s email system, email responses are delayed.\u201dBrian McMenamin said the breach \u201cis especially disheartening\u201d given its timing after the \u201cstrain and hardship\u201d McMenamins\u2019 employees have gone through over the past two years during the pandemic.McMenamins has reported the incident to the FBI and is also working with a cybersecurity firm to identify the source and full scope of the attack, the company said.Some sources have attributed the attack to the Russian-speaking Conti gang \u2013 a group that Palo Alto Networks has called \u201cone of the most ruthless\u201d and sophisticated ransomware groups out there. Conti is known to ask for unreasonable ransom amounts,\u00a0 such as the $40 million ransom demand it made of Broward County Public Schools in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., earlier this year. It also has a history of hitting organizations while they\u2019re down, as seen in a May attack on the Irish health service.It also recently tinkered with its code (and its personnel recruiting) to juice its ability to find and fully destroy backups that victims may otherwise use to restore operations in the wake of a ransomware hit. And, in late December, Conti became one of the first professional gangs to claim a full Log4Shell exploit chain.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\u00a0BreachMalwarePrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER) released a joint advisory warning the Log4Shell flaw is being abused by threat actors that are compromising public-facing VMware Horizon and Unified Access Gateway (UAG) servers.The VMware Horizon is a platform used by administrators to run and deliver virtual desktops and apps in the hybrid cloud, while UAG provides secure access to the resources residing inside a network.According to the CISA, in one instance the advance persistent threat (APT) actor compromises the victim\u2019s internal network, procures a disaster recovery network, and extracts sensitive information. \u201cAs part of this exploitation, suspected APT actors implanted loader malware on compromised systems with embedded executables enabling remote command and control (C2),\u201d CISA added.Log4Shell is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting the logging library known as \u201cLog4j\u201d in Apache. The library is widely used by various organizations, enterprises, applications, and services.Attack Analysis The CGCYBER conducts a proactive threat hunting engagement at an organization that was compromised by the threat actors who exploited Log4Shell in VMware Horizon. This revealed that after gaining initial access to the victim system, the adversary uploaded a malware identified as \u201chmsvc.exe\u201d.The researchers analyzed the sample of the hmsvc.exe malware and confirmed that the process masquerading as a legitimate Windows service and an altered version of SysInternals LogonSessions software.According to the researcher sample of hmsvc.exe malware was running with the highest privilege level on a Windows system and contains an embedded executable that allows threat actors to log keystrokes, upload and execute payloads.\u201cThe malware can function as a C2 tunneling proxy, allowing a remote operator to pivot to other systems and move further into a network,\u201d\u00a0The initial execution of malware created a scheduled task that is set to execute every hour.According to CISA in another onsite incident response engagement, they observed bi-directional traffic between the victim and the suspected APT IP address.The attackers initially gain access to the victim\u2019s production environment (a set of computers where the user-ready software or update are deployed), by exploiting Log4Shell in unpatched VMware Horizon servers. Later CISA observed that the adversary uses Powershell scripts to perform lateral movements, retrieve and execute the loader malware with the capability to remotely monitor a system, gain reverse shell and exfiltrate sensitive information.Further analysis revealed that attackers with access to the organization test and production environment leveraged CVE-2022-22954, an RCE flaw in VMware workspace ONE access and Identity manager. to implant the Dingo J-spy web shell,Incident Response and MitigationsCISA and CGCYBER recommended multiple actions that should be taken if an administrator discovers compromised systems:Isolate compromised systemAnalyze the relevant log, data and artifacts.All software should be updated and patched from the \u00a0.Reduce the non-essential public-facing hosting service to restrict the attack surface and implement \u00a0DMZ, strict network access control, and WAF to protect against attack.Organizations are advised to implement best practices for identity and access management (IAM) by introducing multifactor authentication (MFA), enforcing strong passwords, and limited user access.MalwareVulnerabilities",

However, researchers say that is not always the case and files stored on SharePoint and OneDrive can be vulnerable to a ransomware attack.The research comes from Proofpoint, which lays out what it say is \u201cpotentially dangerous piece of functionality\u201d in a report released last week.\u201cProofpoint has discovered a potentially dangerous piece of functionality in Office 365 or Microsoft 365 that allows ransomware to encrypt files stored on SharePoint and OneDrive in a way that makes them unrecoverable without dedicated backups or a decryption key from the attacker,\u201d according to researchers.How the Attack Chain Works The attack chain assumes the worst and starts with an initial compromise of an Office 365 user\u2019s account credentials. This leads to an account takeover, then discovery of data within the SharePoint and OneDrive environment and eventually a breach of data and ransomware attack.Why this is a big deal, argues Proofpoint, is that tools such as cloud backups via Microsoft\u2019s \u201cauto-save\u201d feature have been part of a best-practices for preventing a ransomware attack. Should data be locked-up on an endpoint, there would be a cloud backup to save the day. Configuring how many versions of a file is save in on OneDrive and SharePoint further reduces the damage an attack. The likelihood of and adversary encrypting previous versions of a file stored online reduces the likelihood of a successful ransomware attack.Proofpoint says these precautions can be sidestepped via an attacker modifying versioning limits, which allows an attacker to encrypt all known versions of a file.\u201cMost OneDrive accounts have a default version limit of 500 [version backups]. An attacker could edit files within a document library 501 times. Now, the original (pre-attacker) version of each file is 501 versions old, and therefore no longer restorable,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cEncrypt the file(s) after each of the 501 edits. Now all 500 restorable versions are encrypted. Organizations cannot independently restore the original (pre-attacker) version of the files even if they attempt to increase version limits beyond the number of versions edited by the attacker. In this case, even if the version limit was increased to 501 or more, the file(s) saved 501 versions or older cannot be restored,\u201d they wrote.An adversary with access to compromised accounts can abuse the versioning mechanism found under the list settings and affects all the files in the document library. The versioning setting can be modified without requiring administrator privilege, an attacker can leverage this by creating too many versions of a file or encrypting the file more than the versioning limit. For instance, if the reduced version limit is set to 1 then the attacker encrypts the file twice. \u201cIn some cases, the attacker may exfiltrate the unencrypted files as part of a double extortion tactic, \u201d said researchersMicrosoft RespondsWhen asked, Microsoft commented \u201cthe configuration functionality for versioning settings within lists is working as intended,\u201d according to Proofpoint. It added \u201colder versions of files can be potentially recovered and restored for an additional 14 days with the assistance of Microsoft Support,\u201d researchers quote Microsoft.Researchers countered in a statement: \u201cProofpoint attempted to retrieve and restore old versions through this process (i.e., with Microsoft Support) and was not successful. Secondly, even if the versioning settings configuration workflow is as intended, Proofpoint has shown that it can be abused by attackers towards cloud ransomware aims.\u201dSteps to Secure Microsoft Office 365Proofpoint recommends users fortify their Office 365 accounts by enforcing a strong password policy, enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), and regularly maintaining the external backup of sensitive data.The researcher also suggested the \u2018response and investigation strategies\u2019 that should be implemented if a change in configuration is triggered.Increase the restorable versions for the affected document libraries.Identify the high-risk configuration that is altered and previously compromised accounts.OAuth tokens for any suspicious third-party apps should be revoked immediately.Hunt for policy violation patterns across cloud, email, web, and endpoint by any user.\u201cFiles stored in a hybrid state on both endpoint and cloud such as through cloud sync folders will reduce the impact of this novel risk as the attacker will not have access to the local/endpoint files,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cTo perform a full ransom flow, the attacker will have to compromise the endpoint and the cloud account to access the endpoint and cloud-stored files.\u201dHacks",

        "raw text": "Consumer electronics giant Panasonic\u2019s data breach raises questions, researchers say \u2013 given that more than two weeks after the incident was discovered, it\u2019s unclear if customers\u2019 personal information has been impacted.On Friday, Panasonic confirmed that its \u201cnetwork was illegally accessed by a third party on November 11, 2021,\u201d and that \u201csome data on a file server had been accessed during the intrusion.\u201dIt added, \u201cPanasonic is currently working [to] determine if the breach involved customers\u2019 personal information and/or sensitive information related to social infrastructure.\u201dFurther details on the breach are thin, with Panasonic\u2019s bare-bones statement offering very little in the way of technical detail or timeline. However, local reports picked up by the Record indicated that the breach had been ongoing since June, giving attackers plenty of time to knock around in the Japanese behemoth\u2019s files.The NHK news outlet also noted that \u201cin addition to information about the company\u2019s technology and business partners, personal information of employees was stored on the server\u2026.the company says that the leakage of information to the outside has not been confirmed at this time,\u201d according to its sources [translation via Google Translate].However, Jake Williams, co-founder and CTO at BreachQuest, speculated that the intrusion could balloon into a major incident.\u201cAs is typical in these early-stage incident reports, there are many unknowns,\u201d he said via email. \u201cIn this case however, there are already red flags. NHK reported that internal network monitoring was the source of the incident detection, seemingly implying that the depth of intrusion is more than a misconfigured external server\u2026Those [misconfiguration] cases at least have localized impact because there is no threat of threat actor lateral movement deeper into the network.\u201dJohn Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, also noted that the four-month gap between breach and detection is concerning.\u201cWhile attacks on Japanese companies are continuing, the fact that the initial infection occurred in June and wasn\u2019t detected until November demonstrates that companies are continuing to lag behind attackers,\u201d he said via email. \u201cBreaches need to be detected in hours, not months.\u201dHowever, Eddy Bobritsky, CEO at Minerva Labs, had a different take on the reported timeline.\u201cAlthough their investigation hasn\u2019t been completed yet, Panasonic seem to be lucky here as they were able to detect the breach relatively quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to\u2026IBM\u2019s \u2018Cost of Data Breach 2021\u2019 report, on average it took 287 days to identify and contain a data breach.\u201dThe news follows a ransomware attack on Panasonic India last year, which resulted in email addresses and financial data being leaked. Also, Panasonic is just the latest in a line of attacks on Japanese companies: Info-stealing hacks in 2020 on\u00a0Kawasaki,\u00a0Kobe Steel and Pasco, Mitsubishi Electric and NEC formed a notable cluster of events. And, this October, a ransomware attack paralyzed Japanese tech giant Olympus.It\u2019s unclear yet when more details will emerge in the latest hit. \u201cPanasonic likely has some work ahead to threat hunt in its network before fully understanding the scope of the compromise,\u201d BreachQuest\u2019s Williams said.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) served up more than tasty meals recently after a data breach exposed the names and Social Security numbers (SSNs) of more than 100,000 current and former employees.The \u201cexternal system breach\u201d occurred on Sept. 15 at the popular U.S. pizza chain and affected 103,767 people, according to a Data Breach Notification posted on the website of the Maine Attorney General. CPK, founded in Beverly Hills, Calif. in 1985, has more than 250 locations across 32 states.CPK discovered \u201csuspicious activity\u201d in its computing environment \u201con or about Sept. 15\u201d and took hasty action to mitigate and investigate the occurrence with third-party IT specialists, according to the notice.\u201cCPK immediately secured the environment and \u2026 launched an investigation to determine the nature and scope of the incident,\u201d the company wrote in the notice CPK sent to affected residents of Maine.By Oct. 4, investigators had confirmed that certain files on CPK\u2019s systems \u201ccould have been accessed without authorization,\u201d according to the notice. By the end of the initial review on Oct. 13, it was clear that the breach had delivered attackers the names of former and current employees in combination with their SSNs, the company said.CPK provided written notice to all affected individuals of the breach on Monday, Nov. 15. At this time there is no indication that the information accessed has been abused by cybercriminals, the company said.Training Equals PreventionSpecifics have not been revealed about exactly what type of breach occurred nor how attackers infiltrated the system. CPK did not immediately return Threatpost\u2019s request for comment on the incident.The company is currently reviewing existing security policies and has implemented additional measures \u2013 including safeguards and employee training \u2013 to help prevent similar incidents going forward, according to the notice.One security professional noted that employee training is a key element of helping to avoid breaches like this, which are all too common at organizations that have sensitive data on their networks but typically employ people without specific knowledge of how security breaches can occur.\u201cEvery business like California Pizza Kitchen possesses valuable PII data which makes them a prime target for attackers,\u201d Al-Khalidi, co-founder and co-CEO of security firm Axiad, wrote in an email to Threatpost. \u201cTo help protect against attacks, enterprises need to ensure their employees practice good cybersecurity hygiene.\u201dOngoing training, which can prevent employees from falling prey to phishing or other socially engineered attacks that can take down an entire IT environment, can bolster a company\u2019s overall security defense, he said.Zero-Trust ApproachIndeed, \u201ctraining plays a vital role in any rounded approach to cybersecurity by arming as many users as possible to be alert to risks and follow best practices,\u201d concurred Danny Lopez, CEO of security firm Glasswall.However, training is little more than \u201cbox-ticking\u201d and won\u2019t help prevent breaches like the one CPK experienced if employees aren\u2019t encouraged to \u201craise the alarm if something doesn\u2019t feel right\u201d without fear of ridicule or punishment if they speak up, he added.Moreover, employee training can\u2019t replace a solid technology-based security posture that errs on the side of paranoia in preventing cyber-attacks, Lopez told Threatpost via email.\u201cTaking a proactive, zero trust (never trust/always verify) approach to cybersecurity and having the measures in place to prevent attacks from penetrating your systems is critical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also far more efficient and cost-effective than relying solely on your employees.\u201dCybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "Investor trading app company Robinhood Markets has confirmed a data breach that affects the personal information of about 7 million customers \u2013 roughly a third of its user base. A cyberattacker made off with emails and more, which could lead to follow-on attacks for Robinhood customers.The trading platform, which found itself in the middle of the infamous GameStop stock price run-up in January, acknowledged that the breach was a result of a system compromise that occurred on Nov. 3. The company said that the adversary was able to target an employee to gain access to sensitive company systems. After that, the perpetrator attempted to extort the company, demanding payment in return for not releasing the stolen data.\u201cThe unauthorized party socially engineered a customer-support employee by phone and obtained access to certain customer support systems,\u201d Robinhood said Monday in a statement. It added, \u201cAfter we contained the intrusion, the unauthorized party demanded an extortion payment. We promptly informed law enforcement and are continuing to investigate the incident with the help of Mandiant, a leading outside security firm.\u201dFor 5 million of the victims, the cybercrook made off with email addresses. For 2 million of them, the attacker also absconded with full names. Meanwhile, names, birth dates and ZIP codes were stolen for 310 people, and \u201cmore extensive account details\u201d were heisted for 10 more, the company said.The good news is that it looks like no Social Security numbers, bank account numbers or debit card numbers were exposed, \u201cand that there has been no financial loss to any customers as a result of the incident,\u201d according to the Monday statement from the firm, which called the incident \u201ccontained.\u201dThe company said it\u2019s in the process of notifying affected individuals, who could be targeted with additional, and convincing, social-engineering and phishing attacks using their emails and other personal information gleaned from public sources, experts warned.But despite this, and despite the scope of the breach, a senior security researcher for DomainTools, Chad Anderson, applauded the company for its transparency.\u201cThis is an unfortunate breach for Robinhood and reads like it could have been prevented with more process,\u201d he said via email. \u201cI have to commend their team for being transparent however with the impact of the breach and timeliness of their information release. Responses like that allow defenders to warn users and position themselves well for what will likely be a round of scams targeting the emails of those users exposed.\u201dHow to Defend Against Socially Engineered Data BreachesNotably, this breach was the result of duping an employee into falling for a phishing attempt, rather than a hack of internal systems using a vulnerability exploit or other avenue.Preventing social-engineering attacks is notoriously difficult because in the end, human error is impossible to root out. As a starting point, though, employees should be trained to spot and report social engineering and phishing attacks, and organizations should have a policy telling employees how to report these attacks, according to Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4.\u201cSocial engineering continues to play a significant role in spreading malware and ransomware as well as in breaches such as this one,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThe bad actors behind these attacks are often highly-skilled and very convincing when they get a potential victim on the line. Unfortunately, technology is not good at stopping these attacks, so the best defense against these attempts is education and training.\u201dThis is especially important in an era when most employees work in a hyper-accelerated data environment, added Trevor Morgan, product manager with data security specialists comforte AG, in an email.\u201cWe have all gotten used to working faster and pushing information out as fast as we can, but this is exactly the vulnerability that social engineering preys upon,\u201d he said. \u201cNot taking the time to inspect emails, to think through a situation without haste or pressure, or to confirm a request to ensure the legitimacy of the requestor is the fatal flaw.\u201dHe added that organizations can do two things: Encourage a security-minded company culture and employ data security.\u201cOne, build an organizational culture that values data privacy and encourages employees to slow down and consider all of the ramifications before acting on requests for sensitive information,\u201d he explained. Two, IT leaders can consider data-centric security as a means to protect sensitive data rather than the perimeters around data. \u201cTokenization, for example, not only makes sensitive data elements incomprehensible, but it also preserves data format so business applications and users can still work with the data in protected states. If you never de-protect data, chances are that even if it falls into the wrong hands, the sensitive information cannot be compromised.\u201dWant to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

        "raw text": "AUTHOR: Mohit Tiwari, CEO and Co-Founder, Symmetry SystemsCompromised credentials and identities, third-party breaches, API attacks, and application exploits are all foundational entry points for today\u2019s hackers.Recent months have brought many high-profile breaches from Samsung and Nvidia to Okta and the continued aftermath of Log4j. Still, ultimately, these attacks are all symptoms of the same problem: organizations do not have visibility into how their data objects are protected and used.Until security teams can answer in real-time what data they have, who has access to it, and how it is being used, organizations will continue to fail in rapidly communicating the extent of breaches within the cloud.When Samsung confirmed the Lapsus$ hacking group had obtained and leaked almost 200 gigabytes of confidential data, the first question for customers was whether or not their customers\u2019 data was a part of that statistic or if Samsung had safeguards in place to protect them.Fortunately, Samsung said that no customers\u2019 personal information was compromised. However, when Okta was breached by the same hacking group just a few weeks later, their security team had difficulty communicating the blast radius because they could not seamlessly pinpoint the location and privileges of all the data within their ecosystem. This kind of delay can lead to growing distrust within the broader enterprise community as security teams scramble to identify the full scope of the breach.With so much at stake, an increasing number of organizations are choosing the Zero Trust Security model, which assumes that untrusted users exist on both sides of an organization\u2019s computing perimeter.Zero Trust principles \u2013 whether applied to identities, network, or data objects \u2013 help organizations systematically improve security risks throughout each of visibility, detection, response, and protection. However, in the modern enterprise, implementing Zero Trust for data without breaking business logic is a new direction that requires a careful shift from Posture Management to Detection-Response to Protection to avoid creating business risk or outage.As the concept of Zero Trust continues to evolve, there are a few practical ways that organizations can begin eliminating risk once they have improved visibility and found a solution that works within their cloud or on-prem environment. The United States\u2019 National Institute of Regulations and Technology (NIST), which has released a number of cloud security standards that take into account overlapping federal regulations, including HIPAA and the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), is also a great reference point. It provides supplemental materials and details that update organizations about how the controls coincide and collaborate with other widely accepted standards and frameworks. The NIST model incorporates the following framework:When companies have visibility into their data security posture, they are able to determine and set policies for enhanced data protection across cloud-based organizations to help them better determine how data objects should be treated. Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) tools are a good starting point for your Zero Trust journey.Many critical identities and service roles necessarily need permissions to large swaths of data to do their job \u2013 privileged identities, applications that are fronts for databases or data lakes, and even CI/CD etc. supply chain software are all examples of these. Placing detection and response seat-belts around crown jewel data objects protects them from such identities being mis-used through phishing or app-sec faults.Organizations should create permissions and entitlements, issue cleanup campaigns, and set up governance models to be set up to proactively prepare to respond to detected cybersecurity incidents. These are longer term campaigns with major strategic value and hence are informed by the fine-grained visibility into how data objects are used across different business functions.Simply put, data is valuable and an organization\u2019s most persistent asset. It is critical for organizations to completely understand where their secrets (IP) lie across their entire cloud and on-prem environment. Where is your data? Who has access to it, and is this access monitored? Does your organization maintain authority over this data so excessive or dormant privileges can be revoked when necessary?Answering these questions is foundational to a modern cloud data security strategy, especially when faced with the challenge of operationalizing access control or data security without breaking business logic. If left unanswered, organizations will continue to invest time and resources in tangential protections around networks and applications that leave significant gaps for data to be exploited or taken for ransom.Infosec Insiders columnist Mohit Tiwari is the CEO and Co-Founder of Symmetry Systems.\u00a0Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s\u00a0Infosec\u00a0Insiders\u00a0community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.InfoSec Insider",

        "raw text": "GitHub revealed details tied to last week\u2019s incident where hackers, using stolen OAuth tokens, downloaded data from private repositories.\u201cWe do not believe the attacker obtained these tokens via a compromise of GitHub or its systems because the tokens in question are not stored by GitHub in their original, usable formats,\u201d said Mike Hanley, chief security officer, GitHub.The OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard authorization framework or protocol for token-based authorization on the internet. It enables the end-user account information to be used by third-party services, such as Facebook and Google.\nOAuth doesn\u2019t share credentials instead uses the authorization token to prove identity and acts as an intermediary to approve one application interacting with another.Incidents of stolen or found OAuth tokens commandeered by adversaries are not uncommon.Microsoft suffered an OAuth flaw in December 2021, where applications (Portfolios, O365 Secure Score, and Microsoft Trust Service) were vulnerable to authentication issues that enables attackers to takeover Azure accounts. In order to abuse, the attacker first registers their malicious app in the OAuth provider framework with the redirection URL points to the phishing site. Then, the attacker would send the phishing email to their target with a URL for OAuth authorization.Analysis of The Attacker\u2019s Behavior\u00a0GitHub analysis the incident include that the attackers authenticated to the GitHub API using the stolen OAuth tokens issued to accounts Heroku and Travis CI. It added, most most of those affected authorized Heroku or Travis CI OAuth apps in their GitHub accounts. Attacks were selective and attackers listed the private repositories of interest. Next, attackers proceeded to clone private repositories.\u201cThis pattern of behavior suggests the attacker was only listing organizations in order to identify accounts to selectively target for listing and downloading private repositories,\u201d Hanley said. \u201cGitHub believes these attacks were highly targeted,\u201d he added.GitHub said it is in the process of sending the final notification to its customer who had either Travis CI or Heroku OAuth apps integrated into their GitHub accounts.Initial Detection of The Malicious ActivityGitHub began the investigation into the stolen tokens on April 12, when the GitHub Security first identified unauthorized access to the NPM (Node Package Management) production infrastructure using a compromised AWS API key. These API keys were acquired by attackers when they downloaded a set of private NPM repositories using stolen OAuth token.The NPM is a tool used to download or publish node packages via the npm package registry.The OAuth token access is revoked by Travis CI, Heroku, and GitHub after discovering the attack, and the affected organizations are advised to monitor the audit logs and user account security logs for malicious activity.\u00a0Reported By: Sagar Tiwari, an independent security researcher and technical writer.BreachVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "A fertility clinic serving the Atlanta area has been hit with a ransomware attack that also exposed private health information for 38,000 of its patients.Reproductive Biology Associates (RBA), along with its affiliate My Egg Bank North America, is a well-known pioneer in in-vitro fertilization (IVF). After launching in 1983 as Georgia\u2019s first IVF program, it became first on the East Coast to achieve pregnancy from a frozen embryo, and the first in the Western Hemisphere to report a birth from frozen donor eggs. MyEggBank, meanwhile, is the largest network of donor egg banks and client practices in North America, according to its website.RBA disclosed the breach on Friday. The company said that cyberattackers were able to infiltrate its network on April 7, before moving laterally to a server housing sensitive patient information three days later, on April 10. RBA discovered the attack on April 16.\u201cWe discovered that a file server containing embryology data was encrypted and therefore inaccessible,\u201d according to the notice. \u201cWe quickly determined that this was the result of a ransomware attack and shut down the affected server, thus terminating the actor\u2019s access, within the same business day.\u201dThe firm\u2019s investigation uncovered that the attackers were able to make off with reams of personal information, including full names, addresses, Social Security numbers, laboratory results and \u201cinformation relating to the handling of human tissue.\u201dThat said, RBA also said that it \u201cobtained confirmation from the actor that all exposed data was deleted and is no longer in its possession.\u201d It also did a scan of the Dark Web to see if the data was circulating.\u201cWe conducted supplemental web searches for the potential presence of the exposed information, and at this time are not aware of any resultant exposure,\u201d according to the notice, which added, \u201cWe are continuing to conduct appropriate monitoring to detect and respond to any misuse or misappropriation of the potentially exposed data.\u201dBy June 7, the clinic had identified affected customers and began notifications, it said.It\u2019s unclear which ransomware was involved in the attack, or whether RBA paid the ransom to recover control of its encrypted server and have the stolen data destroyed. It did not immediately return a request for comment.\u201cOrganizations such as fertility clinics may consider themselves as lower risk than, say, hospitals, but the truth is that they have just as much sensitive personal information that is of value to criminals and can disrupt daily operations,\u201d said Javvad Malik, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, via email. \u201cOnce data has been accessed by criminals, even if an organization can restore from backup or pay a ransom, there is no limitation of what the criminals can do with the stolen data. This can include selling the data on to other criminals or using the data themselves to attack unsuspecting victims.\u201dFor its part, RBA made the expected statement of regret that the incident occurred and offered assurances that it takes the security of its information \u201cvery seriously.\u201d It said it has also contracted a professional firm to conduct forensics, like deploying device tracking and monitoring to help contain and investigate the scope of the incident.\u201cWe have also applied additional internal controls and have provided additional cybersecurity training to our staff to prevent this type of incident from occurring in the future,\u201d according to the letter. \u201cThese controls include working with a cybersecurity service provider to remediate actions taken by the actor and restore our systems, updating, patching and in some cases replacing infrastructure to the latest versions, deploying password resets to appropriate users, rebuilding impacted systems and deploying advanced antivirus and malware protection.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET\u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "Both Microsoft and Okta are investigating claims by the new, precocious data extortion group Lapsus$ that the gang has breached their systems.Lapsus$ claimed to have gotten itself \u201csuperuser/admin\u201d access to internal systems at authentication firm Okta. It also posted 40GB worth of files to its Telegram channel, including screenshots and source code, of what the group said is Microsoft\u2019s internal projects and systems.The news was first reported by Vice and Reuters.Okta confirmed on Tuesday that it had been hit and that some customers may have been affected. The scope of the breach isn\u2019t yet clear, but it could be huge: According to Okta, it has hundreds of millions of users that use its platform to provide access to networks, including employees at thousands of large companies such as Fedex, Moody\u2019s, T-Mobile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and GrubHub, to name a few.A Microsoft spokesperson told Threatpost that its investigation found that an account had been compromised, \u201cgranting limited access.\u201d Its cybersecurity response teams quickly engaged to remediate the compromised account and prevent further activity, the spokesperson said.\u201cWe do not rely on the secrecy of code as a security measure and viewing source code isn\u2019t tied to elevation of risk,\u201d Microsoft said. The Microsoft Threat Intelligence team on Tuesday published a blog detailing observed activity of the Lapsus$, which Microsoft tracks as DEV-0537.\u2018Very Worrisome\u2019 ScreenshotsThe purported Okta screenshots included one that appears to show Okta\u2019s Slack channels and another with a Cloudflare interface. In an accompanying message, the group said its focus was \u201cONLY on Okta customers.\u201dBill Demirkapi,\u00a0 an independent security researcher, tweeted that the screenshots \u201care very worrisome. \u2026 LAPSUS$ appears to have gotten access to the @Cloudflare tenant with the ability to reset employee passwords.\u201dCloudflare announced on Tuesday that it\u2019s not up for risking its employees\u2019 Okta credentials. The company, which uses Okta for employee authentication, is resetting its employees credentials, Co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince said on Twitter, \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1506158901078618118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1506158901078618118%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2022%2F03%2F22%2Fokta_lapsus%2F.\u00a0Breach Dates to JanuaryDemirkapi noted another scary thing about the screenshots: Namely, they indicate a date of Jan. 21, 2022. If the date is correct, it suggests that Okta \u201cfailed to publicly acknowledge any breach for at least two months,\u201d he said.The screenshots are very worrisome. In the pictures below, LAPSUS$ appears to have gotten access to the @Cloudflare tenant with the ability to reset employee passwords: pic.twitter.com/OZBMenuwgJ\u2014 Bill Demirkapi (@BillDemirkapi) March 22, 2022Yes, the dates could mean that Lapsus$ has had access to Okta for months, but then again, they could instead indicate that Lapsus$ enjoyed a brief romp before it got kicked out. The latter is the case, Okta CEO Todd McKinnon.On Tuesday, the CEO tweeted that in January 2022, Okta detected an attempted compromise of \u201ca third-party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors\u201d but that \u201cthe matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor.\u201dOkta believes the screenshots Lapsus$ shared online are connected to the January incident. \u201cBased on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January,\u201d McKinnon said.We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event. Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January. (2 of 2)\u2014 Todd McKinnon (@toddmckinnon) March 22, 2022Did Rogue Employees Pitch In?If the dates are accurate, it means that Lapsus$ may well have been successful when it put up a \u201chelp wanted\u201d notice on its Telegram channel on March 10. The group posted that it recruiting company insiders \u2013 including those at Microsoft; other big software/gaming companies such as Apple, IBM or EA; telecoms such as Telefonica, ATT; and more \u2013 to help it carry out its dirty work.From its March 10 Telegram post:\u201cWe recruit employees/insider at the following!!!! \u2026 TO NOTE: WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR DATA, WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE EMPLOYEE TO PROVIDE US A VPN OR CITRIX TO THE NETWORK, or some anydesk\u201d \u2013 references to technologies that the cybercriminals could use to penetrate targets\u2019 networks with insiders\u2019 help.Data on Bing, Bing Maps, Cortana Allegedly StolenOn Monday, Lapsus$ began to circulate a 10GB compressed archive that purportedly contains internal data on Microsoft\u2019s Bing search engine and Bing Maps, along with the source code to the company\u2019s voice assistant software Cortana.The leaked data is dated March 20, 2022.\u201cBing maps is 90% complete dump. Bing and Cortana around 45%,\u201d Lapsus$ wrote on its Telegram channel.Microsoft acknowledged the claims and said that it\u2019s investigating.Lapsus$ Sneers at Okta\u2019s ClaimsOn Tuesday, Okta Chief Security Officer David Bradbury made a number of claims In an updated statement that, within hours, Lapsus$ dismissed. Demirkapi tweeted the group\u2019s slap-back:The LAPSUS$ ransomware group has issued the following response to Okta's statement. pic.twitter.com/D6KYQjnKPU\u2014 Bill Demirkapi (@BillDemirkapi) March 22, 2022Among other things, Lapsus$ scorned Bradbury\u2019s description of the group having breached an engineer\u2019s laptop in the January attempt (it was a thin client, the gang said). The gang also laughed at Bradbury\u2019s claim that the January attempt to access an engineer\u2019s account was unsuccessful (\u201cI\u2019m STILL unsure of how its an unsuccessful attempt? Logged in to superuser portal with the ability to reset the Password and MFA of ~95% of clients isn\u2019t successful?\u201d).Lapsus$ also said that \u201cthe potential impact to Okta customers is NOT limited. I\u2019m pretty sure that resetting passwords and MFA would result in complete compromise of many clients systems.\u201d032822 11:01 UPDATE: In a March 23 update, Bradbury clarified that most support engineering tasks are performed using an internally built app called SuperUser, or SU for short. With the role of SU, support engineers can perform perform basic management functions of Okta customer tenants.. he said.\u201cThis does not provide \u2018god-like access\u2019 to all its users,\u201d Bradbury explained. \u201cThis is an application built with least privilege in mind to ensure that support engineers are granted only the specific access they require to perform their roles. They are unable to create or delete users. They cannot download customer databases. They cannot access our source code repositories.\u201dThe Many Notches on Lapsus$\u2019 BeltThe Lapsus$ group has pulled off a mounting pile of high-profile attacks. In December, it attacked the Brazil Ministry of Health, taking down several online entities, successfully wiping out information on citizens\u2019 COVID-19 vaccination data as well as disrupting the system that issues digital vaccination certificates.More recently, Lapsus$ crippled the Portuguese media giant Impresa; attacked Nvidia, making off with code-signing certificates then used to sign malware and thus enabling malicious programs to slide past security safeguards on Windows machines; released a purportedly massive dump of proprietary source code stolen from Samsung; and attacked Assassin\u2019s Creed video game developer Ubisoft.On Monday, the group also claimed to have breached the electronics giant LGE, according to Security Week.Lapsus$ Is a \u2018Wild Card\u2019Drew Schmitt, Lapsus$ ransomware expert and principal threat intelligence analyst at cybersecurity firm GuidePoint Security, has interacted directly with the group through his years of ransomware negotiations and threat intelligence work.He told Threatpost on Tuesday that the group is a \u201cwild card\u201d in that \u201cthey do not perform encryption of files or data for extortion purposes, rather they target and exfiltrate sensitive data and use that for the primary extortion effort.\u201dThat sets Lapsus$ from the traditional ransomware approach used by groups such as Conti, Lockbit and others he said. Another deviation from traditional ransomware groups is their use of Telegram for communication and extortion purposes versus the use of a leak site hosted using a TOR service, he noted. As well, their initial access to targeted organizations is unorthodox, he said, referring to the March 11 recruiting message for rogue insiders.Lapsus$ apparently operates on its own, without ties to other cybercriminal/ransomware syndicates or nation-state sponsorship, Schmitt said. That could change, though, as analysis continues, he said: \u201cAs this group has gained a lot of notoriety in the past few weeks, it is possible that we will learn new intelligence that indicates connections to other known groups and syndicates.\u201dSchmitt said that Lapsus$ is changing the ransomware game with its non-traditional approaches to initial access, its move away from file encryption, and its deviation from the traditional leak site infrastructure. These are changes that could be adopted by more traditional ransomware groups, he predicted.Not Just the New Kid on the BlockThe Lapsus$ group\u2019s move on Okta makes it clear that these guys are more than simply the new kid on the block, according to security experts.Dave Stapleton, a former government security analyst and current CISO of third-party risk management company CyberGRX, thinks that Lapsus$ is looking to increase its notoriety \u2013 all the better to recruit insiders willing to sell remote access to major technology corporations. Yet another far-reaching supply-chain attack could also be in its sites, he told Threatpost on Tuesday.\u201cWhile details are scarce at the moment, it is clear that this threat actor is working hard to make a name for themselves,\u201d Stapleton said via email. \u201cContinuing to increase their notoriety and standing will support their recruitment of insiders who are willing to sell remote access to major technology corporations and ISPs. With this latest move against Okta, the Lapsus$ group is essentially advertising to potential recruits how they operate.\u201dGiven that Okta is \u201ca crucial identity provider for organizations around the world,\u201d Stapleton fears another in the string of supply-chain attacks that have struck the likes of Toyota, et al. \u201cI\u2019m sure [Okta\u2019s] customers will be watching closely. The threat of another far-reaching supply chain attack certainly has my attention,\u201d he said.Kevin Novak, managing director of Breakwater Solutions, suspects that the scope of Okta\u2019s backend breach is likely limited. Otherwise, given Okta\u2019s massive customer base, we\u2019d likely know it by now. \u201cWhile some have made conjectures about whether this hack contributed to another breach here or there, it would seem that a full compromise of Okta\u2019s backend would have become far more obvious by now, but we\u2019ll see more over the next few months,\u201d he said.\u201cIf \u2026 the compromise involved a successful assault on client information, such as client credentialing, key materials, or source code pertaining to environments that may lead to client compromises, then Okta may suffer much greater scrutiny from the field for its lack of adequate, timely notification of the event,\u201d Novak noted.What to Do NowThe Okta breach is still developing. Still, there are steps organizations can take now to secure their employees and networks. Jon Hencinski, director of global operations at Expel, told Threatpost that precautionary actions to take immediately include rotating privileged Okta passwords and Okta-generated tokens and reviewing Okta admin authentications and activity for the past four months.He provided these other tips:Review configuration changes to ensure they align with expected activities and sources.Review admin authentications and ensure they originate from expected sources based on the source user.Identify any Okta accounts where MFA was disabled during the same time period and determine the user and root cause of that disablement, then re-enable MFA for those accounts.Throughout this process, communicate transparently what you\u2019re doing and have done with your internal and external stakeholders.This is also an opportunity to stress-test your incident response plan (IRP). And if you don\u2019t have an IRP \u2014 create one, then test it and test it again.\u201cFortune favors the prepared,\u201d Hencinski said.032222 19:14 UPDATE: Added response from Microsoft.

        "raw text": "An advanced persistent threat (APT) group has been targeting luxury hotels in Macao, China with a spear-phishing campaign aimed at breaching their networks and stealing the sensitive data of high-profile guests staying at resorts, including the Grand Coloane Resort and Wynn Palace.A threat research report from Trellix \u201ccautiously\u201d identified the South Korean DarkHotel APT group as the culprit behind the attacks.The researchers said the spear-phishing campaign began at the tail end of November, with emails loaded with malicious Excel macros being sent to ranking hotel management with access to hotel networks, including human resources and office managers.In one attack wave, phishing emails were sent to 17 different hotels on Dec. 7 and faked to look like they were sent from the Macao Government Tourism Office, to gather information about who was staying at the hotels. The emails asked the recipient to open an attached Excel file labeled \u201cpassenger inquiry.\u201d\u201cPlease open the attached file with enable content and specify whether the people were staying at the hotel or not?\u201d the malicious email read, according to the threat researchers with Trellix. The communication was signed from the \u201cInspection Division \u2013 MGTO.\u201dThe DarkHotel attack flow. Source: Trellix.Trellix was able to attribute the attacks to DarkHotel with a \u201cmoderate\u201d level of confidence due to the IP address for the command-and-control server (C2), which was previously attached to the group; the targeting of hotels, which DarkHotel is already infamous for; and patterns found in the C2 setup which match known DarkHotel activities, the report said.\u201cHowever, we have lowered our confidence level to moderate because the specific IP address remained active for quite some time even after being publicly exposed, and the same IP address is the origin of other malicious content not related to this specific threat,\u201d the Trellix team said. \u201cThese two observations have made us more cautious in our attribution.\u201dDarkHotel Suspected of Stealing Data for Future Attacks Once opened, the macros contacted the C2 server to begin data exfiltration from the hotel networks, the Trellix team explained.\u201cThe command-and-control server, hxxps://fsm-gov(.)com, used to spread this campaign was trying to impersonate a legitimate government website domain for the Federated States of Micronesia,\u201d Trellix\u2019s report added. \u201cHowever, the real Micronesia website domain is \u2018fsmgov.org.'\u201dThe Trellix team said they suspected the attackers were collecting data to be used later.\u201cAfter researching the event agenda for the targeted hotels, we did indeed find multiple conferences that would have been of interest to the threat actor,\u201d the Trellix researchers reported. \u201cFor instance, one hotel was hosting an International Environment Forum and an International Trade & Investment Fair, both of which would attract potential espionage targets.\u201dThe spear-phishing campaign stopped on Jan. 18, the team said.COVID-19 Stalls Campaign That said, the COVID-19 pandemic cancelled or delayed these events, giving law enforcement time to catch on. By Dec. 2021, the Macao Security Force Bureau received a notification from the Cyber Security Incident Alert and Emergency Response Center of the police department that a domain similar to the official Security Force page was being used to spread malware and \u201ccommit illegal acts.\u201dBesides targeting hotels, other campaigns attributed to the same C2 IP address, believed to be controlled by DarkHotel, included going after MetaMask crypto users with a spoofed Collab.Land phishing page, the Trellix report added.DarkHotel has a long history of targeting Chinese victims. In April 2020, the APT group went after Chinese virtual private network (VPN) service provider SangFor, used by several Chinese government agencies. By the end of the first week of that month, at least 200 endpoints had been compromised, according to reports.Around the same time, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, DarkHotel targeted the systems of the World Health Organization.Attacks like these show how attractive data stored in hotel networks can be for threat actors. Hotel operators should recognize that cybersecurity needs to reach beyond their networks\u2019 edge, the Trellix team advised. Travelers likewise need to take appropriate security precautions, Trellix added.\u201cOnly bring the essential devices with limited data, keep security systems up to date and make use of a VPN service when using hotel Wi-Fi,\u201d the report said.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Thousands of mobile apps \u2013 some of which have been downloaded tens of millions of times \u2013 are exposing sensitive data from open cloud-based databases due to misconfigured cloud implementations, new research from Check Point has found.Check Point Research (CPR) found that in three months\u2019 time, 2,113 mobile apps using the Firebase cloud-based database exposed data, \u201cleaving victims unprotected and easily accessible for threat actors to exploit,\u201d according to a blog post published this week.This amounts to an estimated 5 percent of all Firebases being misconfigured on the cloud in some way \u2013 or the equivalent to thousands of new applications every month leaving sensitive data exposed, according to CPR.Mobile apps that researchers found were left vulnerable by cloud misconfigurations were popular apps for dating, fitness, bookkeeping, logo design, e-commerce and more, some with more than 10 million downloads, according to the post.\u201cExposed information includes: chat messages in popular gaming apps, personal family photos, token IDs on \u2026 healthcare applications, data from cryptocurrency exchange platforms, and more,\u201d according to the post.The research once again highlights the vulnerability of misconfigured cloud infrastructure \u2013 a thorn in the side of cloud security since its inception. Moreover, if the CPR research is any indication, that thorn doesn\u2019t seem to be getting any less prickly.\u201cThese databases represent a gold mine for malicious actors, as they allow them to read and write new values in the database,\u201d researchers said in the post. \u201cA hacker could potentially change entries in the bucket and inject malicious content that could infect users or wipe the whole content.\u201dThreat actors also have leveraged misconfigured cloud storages in ransomware attacks \u2013 as was the case with a MongoDB debacle back in 2017 \u2013 demanding ransom payments after extracting and wiping databases that were left open, CPR said.Discovering Exposed DatabasesResearchers discovered the vulnerable databases simply by creating a query in Virus Total that searched for \u201cFirebase URLs in APKs: content: \u2018*.firebaseio.com\u2019 type: apk,\u201d which served all the applications communicating with Firebase services.They checked if access to the database was set on read by accessing the /.json URL. \u201cAny DBs containing sensitive data exposed here should not be accessible as a rule,\u201d according to the post.Next, researchers filtered with keywords such as \u201cToken,\u201d \u201cPassword\u201d or \u201cAdmin,\u201d which they said led to some curious findings regarding which databases were exposed.For instance, the exposed database of a popular podcast-sharing audio platform with more than 5 million downloads exposed users\u2019 bank details, location, phone numbers, chat messages, purchase history and more. Meanwhile, an e-commerce application for a large shopping chain in South America mistakenly exposed its API gateway credentials and API keys, researchers said.They also found that an accounting services app for SMBs with more than 1 million downloads exposed 280,000 phone numbers associated with at least 80,000 company names, addresses, bank balances, cash balances, invoice counts and emails, researchers wrote. CPR also was able to view more than 50,000 private messages in the open database of a dating application with more than 10,000 downloads, they said.Why It HappensThere are several reasons as to why developers leave databases inadvertently exposed in cloud configurations, researchers noted, and they should be mindful of these common errors in future endeavors.One is that while writing code, developers invest a lot of resources to harden an application against several forms of attacks. \u201cHowever, developers may neglect configuring the cloud database properly thus leaving real-time databases exposed, which could then [result] in a catastrophic breach if exploited,\u201d according to CPR.A common configuration error developers make is to manually change the default locked and secured setting of security rules to run tests, and then forget to lock them back up before releasing the app to production. If this happens, it leaves the database open to anyone accessing it and thus susceptible to read and write into the database, researchers said.Researchers were able to find the exposed databases on Virus Total because it\u2019s not uncommon for an app in development to be uploaded to the platform for various reasons, including the desire for developers to check to see if their app is flagged as malicious or to use sandbox features, researchers said.Sometimes organizations\u2019 security policies upload apps automatically to Virus Total as well without the developers\u2019 knowledge, allowing for their discovery, they added.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Mariano Nunez, CEO, OnapsisRepeated warnings from CISA and the Biden Administration on the Russian cyber threat over the last several months have heightened the state of alertness for U.S. agencies and businesses across industries, which are expecting \u2018tit-for-tat\u2019 cyberattacks from Russia in response to the Ukrainian aid package.These cautions come as the Biden Administration\u2019s FY2023 budget proposal demonstrates that cybersecurity is a top priority for the federal government. This additional funding for cybersecurity is significant in this new era of interconnected risk, especially between business applications and critical infrastructure.Although guidance from the White House and CISA advising on this heightened risk for U.S. businesses and the increase in the proposed budget for cybersecurity within the federal government signals that more resources are needed to properly defend against these risks, this does not necessarily translate to more IT budget or security staff within most organizations in the private sector.That means companies must take strategic steps immediately to ensure their business-critical applications remain secure, and they must do so with their current resources. Prioritizing the modernization of aging technology stacks will be essential to mitigate rising cybersecurity vulnerabilities and ensure the security of the organization\u2019s critical systems and applications from malicious cyber campaigns. To do this effectively, hard prioritization decisions will have to happen.Effectively Prioritizing Vulnerabilities in 3 StepsA vital component of vulnerability management is the capacity to prioritize. Merely uncovering vulnerabilities and creating a list isn\u2019t sufficient. Security teams require full context and awareness of the severity and possible business impact to make informed decisions on how to take action.To understand what assets need the most urgent attention, enterprises must create a triage list or ensure one that exists is entirely up to date. This list is created by taking inventory of all assets across the cloud, on-premises, and hybrid environments. Once each potential issue has been identified, organizations should ensure they have included a detailed explanation of the business impact and an associated risk score. Then, with scores assigned and prioritization clearly defined, security teams can make step-by-step plans for remediation, making resolutions simple and making meaningful improvements to security posture with each step.Safeguarding the Top Blindspot: ERPsAlmost any method companies would use to triage which assets need the most urgent attention would elevate one system to the top: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. These business-critical applications carry out essential company procedures throughout the enterprise, from accounting to sales and purchasing. The reliability of ERP systems and their data is crucial to an organization\u2019s capacity to carry out everyday functions. If that data were to be breached by cybercriminals, the results could be devastating.Surprisingly, many of today\u2019s threat detection tools don\u2019t cover these business-critical applications, leaving a huge gap in CISOs\u2019 security programs. Now that organizations have a clear picture of their biggest threats, they must ensure the cybersecurity solutions they adopt don\u2019t have this blind spot and can provide threat detection and response for these essential applications. Security teams should be able to identify internal and external threats in real-time and understand their potential impact so they can respond quickly and effectively without having to spend considerable effort manually reviewing.Achieving More Effective Risk ManagementEvery organization has limited time and resources, so they need to understand how to spend their next dollar or their security team\u2019s next hour. They must know which patches need to be applied most urgently, what configuration changes are needed, and how to conduct testing for safe operation. By utilizing solutions that provide automated tools to help security teams avoid the need to examine all their security configuration variables manually, organizations can free up resources for more strategic tasks and achieve continuous threat detection and response for business-critical applications.Mariano Nunez is the CEO of Onapsis.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.Register Now for this On-demand Event: Join Threatpost and Intel Security\u2019s Tom Garrison in a Threatpost roundtable discussing innovation enabling stakeholders to stay ahead of a dynamic threat landscape.

        "raw text": "We have read enough and more news in recent times on the surge in cyberattacks. It is crystal clear that attackers are not leaving out even the tiniest of security loopholes and are coming up with smarter ways to invade our IT network. Vulnerability management is the most crucial cyber defense process and has remained nearly the same over the last two decades. IT security teams are struggling to reduce the risk exposure and prevent cyberattacks because of the lack of this innovation. Today\u2019s modern attack surface needs a next-gen, advanced vulnerability management approach to deal with the complex, ever-evolving attack surfaces and to curb cyberattacks.Why Conventional Vulnerability Management is not the Best-fit for Modern Security LandscapeVulnerabilities beyond CVEs are overlooked. In the traditional vulnerability management process, the definition of a vulnerability is straightforward, \u201cA CVE or a Software Vulnerability.\u201d CVEs are important to be managed; however, it is not sufficient to deal with the complex attack surface. Numerous security risks exist like a poorly configured setting, asset exposures, deviation in security controls, missing security patches, and security posture anomalies. These security risks present the same threat as software vulnerabilities and must be managed accordinglyLack of integrated remediation controls. Most of the traditional vulnerability management tools in the market do not come with integrated patching to remediate vulnerabilities. This puts IT security teams at the mercy of siloed solutions, leaving them to wonder which tool will provide remediation. With all this chaos, the vulnerabilities are left to prevail in the network, leaving easy access for attackers to exploit.Siloed Interfaces and Multiple-point Solutions Approach. Vulnerability management is not a one-step process. Conventional vulnerability management solutions rely on multiple tools to execute each step, making it hard for IT security teams. This method is also time-consuming and leaves huge security gaps between each step. It also makes it tedious to correlate and assess the vulnerability and mitigate in one place, making it challenging to strategize and improve the whole process.Manual Methods and Repetitive Processes. Traditional Vulnerability management tools are still not fully automated. They rely on manual methods, making the whole process strenuous. Manual methods inhibit the continuity of vulnerability management in a network as IT security teams tend to make the process periodic due to the complexities involved. Performing vulnerability assessment weekly or monthly is not going to be the best solution anymore.Advanced Vulnerability Management: What it is and How it Adds a New Spin to the Process?Advanced Vulnerability Management provides a broader approach to vulnerabilities and addresses different security risks in the IT vulnerability landscape. It manages a wide array of security risks, including software vulnerabilities, asset exposure, missing patches, misconfigurations, deviation in security controls, and security posture anomalies from a single place. In short, it reinvents vulnerability management, where everything right from detection to remediation of vulnerabilities is automatically performed from a centralized console.Top Reasons to Adopt Advanced Vulnerability ManagementManage Diverse Security Risks. Advanced Vulnerability Management goes beyond traditional vulnerability management practices and looks at vulnerabilities beyond CVEs. Along with software vulnerabilities, you will get to address various security risk exposures in your network, increasing the overall efficacy of your vulnerability management program.Eliminate Attack Surface to a Larger Extent. Integrated remediation is a key strength of advanced vulnerability management. With remediation controls available in the same console, you can easily mitigate the vulnerabilities on time and reduce the attack surface to a greater extent.Improve Operational Efficiency. By taking the advanced vulnerability management route, you get to evict the operational challenges of traditional practices. With an integrated approach to managing vulnerabilities and risks, and end-to-end automation, the complexities and chaos of relying on swivel chair interfaces and manual methods are eliminated. You can easily make vulnerability management continuous and eliminate the security gaps between each step from a single centralized console.Align with Regulatory Compliance Goals. Advanced vulnerability management addresses multiple risks, including IT asset exposures, vulnerabilities, patches, and misconfigurations. Managing these security risks is also a part of regulatory compliance benchmarks such as HIPAA, PCI, ISO, NIST, and more. Hence, you can easily comply with these industry security benchmarks by implementing advanced vulnerability management.Strengthen the Security Posture and Lay a Solid Cyberattack Prevention Foundation. When we look at any cyber security framework, prevention comes first before detection, response, and recovery. If we focus our efforts on prevention, we can easily safeguard our network from numerous attacks. Advanced vulnerability management will serve as a crucial cyberattack prevention method and tightens the overall security of a network.The post-pandemic era brought numerous challenges to the digital landscape, and no doubt the attack surface has widened massively. The constant changes in the IT environment are also in favor of attackers, where IT security teams are still struggling to cope. IT security teams need to reinvent the existing vulnerability management process to deal with the rising risks and secure our dynamic IT environment. Advanced Vulnerability Management with a unified approach, integrated remediation, end-to-end automation, and a broader approach to vulnerabilities and risks will level up your vulnerability management game, enabling you to keep attacks at bay.NewsSponsored",

        "raw text": "A critical privilege escalation flaw found in two themes used by more than 90,000 WordPress sites can allow threat actors to take over the sites completely, researchers have found.WordFence Threat Intelligence Team researcher Ramuel Gall discovered the flaw, one of five vulnerabilities he found between early April and early May in the Jupiter and JupiterX Premium WordPress themes, he revealed in a blog post published Wednesday.One of the flaws\u2014tracked as CVE-2022-1654 and rated as 9.9, or critical on the CVSS\u2013allows for \u201cany authenticated attacker, including a subscriber or customer-level attacker, to gain administrative privileges and completely take over any site running either the Jupiter Theme or JupiterX Core Plugin,\u201d he wrote. The plugin is required to run the JupiterX theme.\nAffected versions of the themes are: Jupiter Theme 6.10.1 or earlier, and JupiterX Core Plugin 2.0.7 or earlier.WordFence finished their investigation of most of flaws on April 5 and reported them to the Jupiter and JupiterX theme developer ArtBees on the same day; on May 3 they notified the developer of an additional Jupiter theme flaw. By May 10, the developed had released updated versions of both the Jupiter and JupiterX themes that had patched all the flaws.Critical VulnerabilityThe critical flaw found resides in a function, uninstallTemplate, which is intended to reset a site after a template is uninstalled. However, it \u201chas the additional effect of elevating the user calling the function to an administrator role,\u201d Gall wrote. In the Jupiter theme, the function is found in the theme itself; in JupiterX, it\u2019s present in the JupiterX Core plugin.\u201cVulnerable versions register AJAX actions but do not perform any capability checks or nonce checks,\u201d he wrote.On a site with a vulnerable version of the Jupiter Theme installed, any logged-in user can elevate their privileges to those of an administrator by sending an AJAX request with the action parameter set to abb_uninstall_template. This calls the uninstallTemplate function, which calls the resetWordpressDatabase function, which effectively reinstalls the site with the currently logged-in user as the new site owner, Gall explained.On a site where a vulnerable version of the JupiterX Core plugin is installed, someone can access the same functionality by sending an AJAX request with the action parameter set to jupiterx_core_cp_uninstall_template, he said.Other VulnerabilitiesWordPress plugins, often developed by third-party developers, are notoriously buggy. Previous flaws found in plugins for the popular website-creation and -hosting platform also have allowed for site takeover, as well as enabled WordPress subscribers to totally wipe sites not belonging to them, or attackers to forge emails to subscribers.Of the other flaws that Gall discovered, three\u2014tracked as CVE-2022-1656, CVE-2022-1658 and CVE-2022-1659\u2013are rated as medium risk and one, CVE-2022-1657 is rated as high risk.The high-risk flaw, which affects JupiterX Theme 2.0.6 or earlier and Jupiter Theme 6.10.1 or earlier, can allow an attacker to obtain privileged information, such as nonce values, or perform restricted actions, Gall explained. This can be done by including and executing files from any location on the site.\u201cVulnerable versions of the Jupiter and JupiterX Themes allow logged-in users, including subscriber-level users, to perform Path Traversal and Local File inclusion,\u201d Gall explained.In the JupiterX theme, this can be done by using the jupiterx_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the lib/admin/control-panel/control-panel.php file to call the load_control_panel_pane function. \u201cIt is possible to use this action to include any local PHP file via the slug parameter,\u201d Gall wrote.The Jupiter theme has a nearly identical vulnerability, which an attacker can exploit via the mka_cp_load_pane_action AJAX action present in the framework/admin/control-panel/logic/functions.php file, which calls the mka_cp_load_pane_action function, he said.Wordfence researchers recommend that anyone using the affected themes updated to the patched versions immediately. The company released a firewall rule to protect Wordfence Premium, Wordfence Care and Wordfence Response customers on April 5, and free Wordfence users on May 4.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "It\u2019s not my intention to be alarmist about the Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), known as Log4Shell, but this one is pretty bad. First of all, Log4j is a ubiquitous logging library that is very widely used by millions of computers. Second, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) says this is the most serious vulnerability she has ever seen in her career spanning decades, and many security experts agree. Third, researchers say that cyberattackers are already exploiting the vulnerability hundreds of times every minute. The fact is, Log4Shell is relatively easy to exploit, so even low-skilled hackers can take advantage.OK, maybe it is time for alarm.Log4j is open-source software from the Apache Software Foundation. As explained by The Conversation, this logging library is widely used to record events such as routine system operations and errors, and to communicate diagnostic messages regarding those events. A feature in Log4j allows users of the software to specify custom code for formatting a log message. This feature also allows third-party servers to submit software code that can perform all kinds of actions \u2013 including malicious ones \u2013 on the targeted computer. The result of an exploit for the bug is that an attacker can control a targeted server remotely.Attackers Took Early AdvantageWithin weeks of discovery of the flaw in mid-December, it was already reported that nation-state actors linked to North Korea, China, Iran and other countries had created toolkits for mass-exploiting this vulnerability quickly. Log4Shell also became a darling of the ransomware and botnet gangs operating around the globe. A real danger in this flaw is that there are so many ways to exploit it for malicious purposes.How prevalent is Log4j in business systems? Analysis by Wiz and Ernst & Young of more than 200 enterprise cloud environments with thousands of cloud accounts showed that 93 percent of those environments are at risk from the vulnerability.\u00a0Google researchers discovered that more than 8 percent of all packages on Maven Central, a large Java package repository, have at least one version that is impacted by this vulnerability\u2014an \u201cenormous\u201d amount by all standards of ecosystem impact.\u00a0So, yeah, that\u2019s pretty extensive presence of this vulnerability. As for the global impact, it\u2019s still too early to tell. Much will depend on how well organizations respond to the threat.Everyone Must Take ActionFor everyone affected by this, there is both a business and moral imperative to take immediate steps to mitigate the vulnerability if it exists within public-facing systems. Naturally, no business wants its systems to be vulnerable to an attack that can lead to the corruption or theft of data and the potential for severe business disruption.\u00a0As for the moral imperative, the Federal Trade Commission points out that companies have a responsibility to take steps \u201cto reduce the likelihood of harm to consumers.\u201d\u00a0 With the fallout from the Equifax breach still fresh in memory, the FTC warns that it \u201cintends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take\u202freasonable\u202fsteps to protect consumer data from exposure\u202fas a result of Log4j,\u202for similar known vulnerabilities in the future.\u201d\u202fNot every company serves consumers, of course, but that shouldn\u2019t matter with regard to addressing this issue.CISA issued a list of \u201cimmediate actions\u201d that organizations must undertake to remediate the risks posed by Log4Shell. The top action is to understand the extent of the problem by identifying which of your assets use the Log4j software and then apply an appropriate patch. Stop the bleed, so to speak. After that, you must assume you have already been compromised, hunt for signs of malicious activity within your systems, and continue to monitor for odd traffic patterns or behavior that could be indicative of an ongoing attack.\u00a0It\u2019s essential to detect the threat activity as the vulnerability is exploited or as attackers successfully insert themselves into your environment. This is where the efficacy of your security tools is put to the test.How Effective Are Your Security Tools?Security tools that are dependent on traditional rule-based detection and pattern matching may have easily caught some of the commands being executed by injected malware in the early days of this exploit. However, as variants of Log4Shell hit the wild with better execution tactics, traditional security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR) tools may struggle to identify attacks unless tool vendors make very frequent updates to the rule base. And that just isn\u2019t practical. Taking a layered security approach that includes some advanced detection methods such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and behavior analytics will also be crucial.Every organization should have a mitigation plan in case something like this comes up again in the future.\u00a0Whether it be to shut down the offending piece of software, or immediately patch it and test the patch before it goes back into production, teams need to be prepared for a proactive response within hours or even minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Log4Shell is a wake-up call for everyone. We shouldn\u2019t hit the snooze button until the next vulnerability comes around.Saryu Nayyar is CEO at Gurucul.\n\nEnjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our microsite.InfoSec InsiderVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Rapid7 has offered up more details on a SonicWall critical flaw that allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on affected devices, noting that it arises from tweaks that the vendor made to the Apache httpd server.The bug (CVE-2021-20038) is one of five vulnerabilities discovered in its series of popular network access control (NAC) system products.In October, Rapid7 lead security researcher Jake Baines discovered the flaws in Sonic Wall\u2019s Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series of devices, which includes SMA 200, 210, 400, 410 and 500v, he wrote in a report published Tuesday.Sonic Wall\u2019s SMA 100 line provides end-to-end secure remote access to corporate resources, whether they are hosted on-premise, in the cloud or in hybrid data centers. The suite also offers policy-enforced access control for corporate users to applications after establishing user and device identity and trust.CVE-2021-20038 is the most critical of the flaws, with a rating of 9.8 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). It\u2019s a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that an attacker can exploit to gain complete control of a device or virtual machine that\u2019s running SonicWall\u2019s NAC solution.The flaw allows attackers to overwrite several security-critical data on an execution stack that can lead to arbitrary code execution, according to its advisory listing on the Common Weakness Enumeration website.\u201cThe most prominent is the stored return address, the memory address at which execution should continue once the current function is finished executing,\u201d according to the advisory. \u201cThe attacker can overwrite this value with some memory address to which the attacker also has write access, into which they place arbitrary code to be run with the full privileges of the vulnerable program.\u201dExploiting the Critical Vulnerability The stack-based buffer overflow flaw discovered by Baines affects SonicWall SMA 100 series version: 10.2.1.1-19sv and is by far is the most dangerous for affected devices, and thus the most advantageous for attackers, he wrote.By exploiting the issue, attackers \u201ccan get complete control of the device or virtual machine\u201d that\u2019s running the appliance, according to the report.\u201cThis can allow attackers to install malware to intercept authentication material from authorized users, or reach back into the networks protected by these devices for further attack,\u201d Baines wrote.This week, Baines revealed that the problem in the device lies in its web server, which is \u201ca slightly modified version of the Apache httpd server,\u201d he explained in the report, shared with Threatpost ahead of publication.One of the notable modifications is in the mod_cgi module (/lib/mod_cgi.so) and, specifically, a custom version of the cgi_build_command function that appends all the environment variables onto a single stack-based buffer using strcat, Baines wrote.\u201cThere is no bounds checking on this environment string buildup, so if a malicious attacker were to generate an overly long QUERY_STRING then they can overflow the stack-based buffer,\u201d he explained. This results in a crash that compromises the device, Baines wrote.\u201cTechnically, the \u2026 crash is due to an invalid read, but you can see the stack has been\nsuccessfully overwritten,\u201d he wrote. \u201cA functional exploit should be able to return to an attacker\u2019s desired address.\u201dSince edge-based NAC devices \u201care especially attractive targets for attackers,\u201d Baines said it\u2019s essential that companies with networks that use SonicWall\u2019s SMA 100 series devices in whatever form apply SonicWall\u2019s update as quickly as possible to fix the issues, Baines said.Reported & Fixed: Patch NowThe other flaws discovered by Barnes were rated with CVSS severity in the range of 6.5 to 7.5. They include an \u201cimproper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command,\u201d or OS command injection flaw with a rating of 7.2 (CVE-2021-20039); a relative path traversal vulnerability with a rating of 6.5 (CVE-2021-20040); a loop with unreachable exit condition, or infinite loop flaw with a rating of 7.5 (CVE-2021-20041); and an unintended proxy or intermediary also known as a \u201cconfused deputy\u201d vulnerability with a rating of 6.5 (CVE-2021-20042).In his research, Baines tested the SMA 500v firmware versions 9.0.0.11-31sv and 10.2.1.1-19sv finding that CVE-2021-20038 and CVE-2021-20040 affect only devices running version 10.2.x, while the remaining issues affect both firmware versions.Baines reported the flaws to SonicWall and worked with the vendor to remediate the vulnerabilities over a period of about two months. On Dec. 7, SonicWall released a security advisory and updates fixing the problems Baines had identified.His report details each flaw and its impact and was published according to Rapid7\u2019s vulnerability disclosure policy.Password\u00a0Reset:\u00a0On-Demand Event: Fortify 2022 with a password-security strategy built for today\u2019s threats.

        "raw text": "SAP has identified 32 apps that are affected by CVE-2021-44228 \u2013 the critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j Java-based logging library that\u2019s been under active attack since last week.As of yesterday, Patch Tuesday, the German software maker reported that it\u2019s already patched 20 of those apps, and it\u2019s still feverishly working on fixes for 12. SAP provided workarounds for some of the pending patches in this document, accessible to users on the company\u2019s support portal.The news about Log4Shell has been nonstop, with the easily exploited, ubiquitous vulnerability spinning off even more dangerous variations, being associated with yet another vulnerability in Apache\u2019s fast-baked patch and threat actors jumping it on a global scale.Between Sunday and Wednesday morning ET, SAP had released 50 SAP Notes and Knowledge Base entries focusing on Log4j.Beyond \u2018Logapalooza\u2019: Other SAP Patch Tuesday FixesBut hard though it may be to believe, there are other SAP security matters to attend to besidea Logapalooza, including fixes for other severe flaws in the company\u2019s products. On Tuesday, SAP released \u200b\u200b21 new and updated security patches, including four HotNews Notes and six High Priority Notes.\u201cHotNews\u201d is the highest-severity rating that SAP doles out. Three of December\u2019s HotNews-rated bugs carried a CVSS rating of 9.9 (out of 10) and the fourth hit the top mark of 10.Thomas Fritsch, an SAP security researcher at enterprise security firm Onapsis, said in his SAP Patch Tuesday writeup that the number of HotNews Notes may seem high, but one of them \u2013 #3089831, tagged with a CVSS score of 9.9 \u2013 was initially released on SAP\u2019s September 2021 Patch Tuesday. Covering an SQL-injection vulnerability in SAP NZDT Mapping Table Framework, the note was updated in the December Patch Tuesday batch with what Fritsch said was information about possible symptoms. \u201cSAP explicitly says that the update does not require any customer action,\u201d he noted.Another of the HotNews Notes \u2013 #2622660 \u2013 is rated a top criticality of 10, but it\u2019s the continuously recurring HotNews Note that provides an SAP Business Client Patch with the latest tested Chromium fixes.\u201cSAP Business Client customers already know that updates of this note always contain important fixes that must be addressed,\u201d Fritsch said. \u201cThe note references 62 Chromium fixes with a maximum CVSS score of 9.6 \u2014 26 of them rated with High Priority. The last number only reflects vulnerabilities that were reported externally, as Google doesn\u2019t provide such information about internally detected issues.\u201dTaking these out, what\u2019s left of the most critical non-Log4Shell patches are a duo for SAP Commerce that were both released with a CVSS criticality of 9.9, and which are detailed below.This note is for a code-execution vulnerability in SAP Commerce, localization for China, that covers 11 related CVEs. SAP has tagged it with a CVSS score of 9.9. The note patches multiple code-execution vulnerabilities in the product. Fritsch noted that the localization for China package uses the open-source library XStream: a simple library that serializes objects to XML and back again.SAP\u2019s note provides a patch for version 2001 of the localization for China package, meaning that SAP Commerce customers using a lower version need to upgrade before applying the patch, Fritsch said. He pulled out two things worth mentioning when comparing the note\u2019s CVEs with the patches listed on https://x-stream.github.io/security.html:The provided SAP patch contains version 1.4.15 of the XStream libraryVersion 1.4.15 specifically patches Code Execution vulnerabilities, but following the Xstream patch history, it also fixes two Denial-of-Service vulnerabilities and a Server-Site Forgery Request vulnerability\u201cAs a workaround, affected customers can also directly replace the affected XStream library file with its latest version,\u201d Fritsch advised.This one, which is also tagged with a CVSS score of 9.9, patches a code injection issue in a text extraction report of the Translation Tools of SAP ABAP Server & ABAP Platform.Found in Versions 701, 740, 750, 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756 and 804, the vulnerability allows an attacker with low privileges to execute arbitrary commands in the background, Fritsch explained. The fact that such an attacker would need at least a few privileges to exploit the vulnerability bumped its CVSS score down from 10, he said.\u201cThe provided patch just deactivates the affected coding,\u201d Fritsch continued. \u201cThe report is only used by SAP internally, was not intended for release, and does not impact existing functionality.\u201dThose who can access the note and who are interested in which report is affected can get that information in the \u201cCorrection Instructions\u201d section by activating the tab \u201cTADIR Entries,\u201d Fritsch said.Notable SAP High Priority NotesSAP Commerce is also affected by these two notable High Priority notes.Tagged with a CVSS score of 8.8, the first high-priority note addresses SAP Commerce installations configured to use an Oracle database, according to Fritsch. \u201cThe escaping of values passed to a parameterized \u201cin\u201d clause, in flexible search queries with more than 1000 values, is processed incorrectly,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis allows an attacker to execute crafted database queries through the injection of malicious SQL commands, thus exposing the backend database.\u201dSAP Commerce customers using the B2C Accelerator are also affected by SAP Security Note #3113593, tagged with a CVSS score of 7.5. The flaw can allow an attacker with direct write access to product-related metadata in B2C Accelerator to exploit a vulnerability in the jsoup library responsible for metadata sanitization before it\u2019s processed, Fritsch said, allowing the attacker to inflict long response delays and service interruptions that result in denial of service (DoS).Another high-priority note, in SAP Knowledge Warehouse (SAP KW), is #3102769, tagged with a CVSS score of 8.8. The note patches a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can result in sensitive data being disclosed.\u201cThe vulnerability affects the displaying component of SAP KW and SAP explicitly points out that the pure existence of that component in the customer\u2019s landscape is all that is needed to be vulnerable,\u201d Fritsch cautioned.Customers who don\u2019t actively use the displaying component of SAP KW may still experience a security breach, he noted.The note details two possible workarounds:Disabling the affected display component by adding a filter with a specific custom ruleAdding a rewrite rule to SAP Web Dispatcher to prevent redirects (this is only applicable if requests are routed via SAP Web Dispatcher)With a CVSS score of 8.4, SAP Security Note #3123196 describes a code injection vulnerability in two methods of a utility class in SAP NetWeaver AS ABAP.\u201cA highly privileged user with permissions to use transaction SE24 or SE80 and execute development objects is able to call these methods and provide malicious parameter values that can lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the operating system,\u201d Fritsch elucidated.SAP fixed the problem by integrating the affected methods directly into the class without the possibility of passing parameters to those methods. Fritsch said that the affected classes and methods are available in the \u201cCorrection Instructions\u201d section by selecting the tab \u201cTADIR Entries.\u201dThis one, which patches a directory-traversal vulnerability in the SAF-T framework, is tagged with a CVSS score of 7.7. It addresses an issue with the SAF-T framework, which is used to convert SAP tax data into the Standard Audit File Tax format (SAF-T) \u2013 an OECD international standard for the electronic exchange of data that enables tax authorities of all countries to accept data for tax purposes \u2013 and back.The note describes how an insufficient validation of path information in the framework allows an attacker to read the complete file-system structure, Fritsch explained.Open-Source Libraries as the Weakest LinkFritsch pointed to the Log4j vulnerability and the vulnerabilities described in SAP Security Notes #3109577 and #3113593 as demonstrating \u201cthat there is always a risk involved when using open-source libraries.\u201dBesides the Log4Shell elephant in the room, recent examples that prove his point about the risks entailed by relying on the security of outside code include, for example, the recent discovery of three malicious packages hosted in the Python Package Index (PyPI) code repository that collectively have more than 12,000 downloads: downloads that potentially translate into loads of poisoned applications.Another of many examples of how the software supply chain has become an increasingly popular method of distributing malware cropped up last week, when a series of malicious packages in the Node.js package manager (npm) code repository that looked to harvest Discord tokens was found.External libraries are convenient, but are they worth the risk? You have to do the math to figure that out, Fritsch summed up: \u201cThe ability to implement new features in a short period of time is bought at the price of dependence on the security of the external libraries. Remember, a software product is only as secure as its weakest software component.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Any cybersecurity attack \u2014 whether it be a breach, an incident or any form of compromise \u2014 starts with hackers getting in through the door. Threat actors and adversaries rely on gaining code execution on a target system which they can then leverage to do more damage\u2014a phase commonly referred to as initial access.More often than not, the easiest way for an attacker to gain initial access is by exploiting the human vulnerability. This involves tricking an end user into taking some action that ultimately gives the threat actor more power than they had before. They lay a trap and propose a cleverly disguised lie to as many potential victims as possible. Even though a threat actor may attempt to fool a thousand users at one time, they only need one to fall for the charade.Threat actors design and deliver this scheme typically through email\u2014the easiest way to put digital content in front of any individual. In today\u2019s world, this is common language: \u201cBe careful not to fall for phishing emails.\u201d\u00a0For decades, the security industry has attempted to train users to stay vigilant against phishing emails with the boilerplate basics you have heard time and time again: \u201cLook for bad grammar or spelling mistakes,\u201d \u201cdouble-check the sending address,\u201d \u201chover over the link,\u201d etc. While these saturated lessons might help ward off the low-hanging fruit, well-crafted phishing emails from sophisticated actors may be genuinely hard to spot.Bait on the LurePhishing emails or any sort of digital deception carry similar traits, but might have different desired outcomes. The most successful phishing campaigns do three things:\u00a0Set the stage with a pretenseStrike fear with a threatDemand action through urgencyPretense typically tugs at a person\u2019s heartstrings or capitalizes on real-world threats or current events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, taxes or elections, cryptocurrencies, or even blackmail and extortion (\u201cI have your password/I have you on webcam\u201d threats).The overall goal of a phish, however, varies.Credential HarvestingThe adversary may set up a \u201clookalike\u201d website, masquerading as a page that the user expected and intended to go to, but which instead delivers username and password combos to the threat actor when victims attempt to log in.Source: Huntress.Session HijackingThe adversary also may implant code on a staged website or HTML file, forcing the user\u2019s browser to download a file or leave behind cookies that can be used for later actions performed by the threat actor:Source: Huntress.Malicious File AttachmentsThe adversary most often however attaches a specific file to an email, suggesting that the user download it and open it on their own volition. This file often masquerades as a legitimate document, but will instead execute code upon being opened.Source: Huntress.Let\u2019s turn our focus to this file-attachment attack vector\u2014specifically, malicious Microsoft Office documents, which can run code with a macro.Macro MalwareOne extremely common file attachment type included in phishing emails are Microsoft Office documents (like Word, PowerPoint or Excel)\u2014masquerading as innocent files that any user or employee might open on a daily basis.\u00a0Consider an HR representative or a hiring manager at any company. Their legitimate job function is to receive and handle applications from interested applicants, oftentimes opening incoming emails and downloading their attachments, perhaps to view an incoming prospect\u2019s resume.\u00a0Malicious Office documents, or maldocs, can execute code via macros if they are given explicit user permission. Once opened, the adversary must continue the charade and trick the user to click \u201cEnable Editing\u201d or \u201cEnable Content\u201d for a macro to run.Source: Huntress.Macro code will execute upon clicking the \u201cEnable Content\u201d via a specific function handler:Sub Document_Open()\nSubstitutePage\nEnd Sub\nSub AutoOpen()\n SubstitutePage\nEnd Sub\nSub SubstitutePage()\nActiveDocument.Content.Select\nSelection.Delete\nActiveDocument.AttachedTemplate.AutoTextEntries(\u201cCandidate\u201d).Insert Where:=Selection.Range, RichText=True\nEnd SubThe AutoOpen() or Document_Open() subroutines define the code that will run immediately once the Office document is opened or the user enables content. In the snippet of code above, the process to emulate \u201cdecrypting\u201d the content is shown\u2014simply switching out the original document with content that is saved in an attached template, taking advantage of another feature of Microsoft Word to hide things from the user.Tools of the Trade: Analysis TacticsThere are several tools available to help threat hunters inside companies identify macros and catch them before they detonate. Here are two.This tool tends to be run on Linux as it is a Python tool. It does a nice job of finding key indicators that might set off an alarm for a threat hunter. It generates an output that gives threat researchers a chunk of macro code to see if any of that code warrants additional attention.Source: Huntress.This tool takes a different approach than Olevba. Whereas Olevba decodes back-end VBAproject.bin files in .ZIP files and generates the source code, ViperMonkey emulates VisualBasic (VB) scripts to a certain extent. It can run VB shellcode and see what it does\u2014all without posing any real harm to users. It can even bypass evasive techniques threat actors take when it comes to malicious Office documents, such as splitting up the code throughout the document to make it harder to identify. ViperMonkey can find those pieces of code and piece them together to be analyzed.Source: Huntress.The Perpetual Cyber BattleHiding malware within Office documents is not a new trick\u2014it\u2019s just a very successful one. Despite knowing the scams and noticing the red flags, we\u2019re seeing a trend of more targeted and methodical phishing campaigns. And this might leave many defenders feeling like they\u2019re playing a game of whack-a-mole and reacting to the new tricks and tactics that attackers are using. But as attackers have gotten better at social engineering and finding ways to dupe users and their technology, we like to think that us defenders are certainly rising to the challenge and better prepared for battle.John Hammond is a senior security researcher at Huntress.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our microsite.\u00a0InfoSec InsiderVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The inexorable movement of data and applications to the cloud that began several years ago and accelerated during the pandemic shows no signs of slowing down. The rationale for this transformation is driven by a desire to outsource non-critical functions (building and maintaining data centers, running and patching standard software packages) and to achieve business agility (scaling up, the ability to rapidly shift focus in light of market conditions).Some of this migration is to public clouds such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. These platforms have brought the notion of the \u201cshared-responsibility model\u201d to the fore, related to the security and compliance of the overall solution. In this article, I consider the public cloud shared-responsibility model through the perspective of some recent security vulnerabilities found in public-cloud platforms, and the ramifications they had on users.Here\u2019s a sneak peek at the conclusion: Cloud service providers are not necessarily great at hardening the software images they supply to companies.The Shared-Responsibility ModelAs a picture is worth a thousand words, so here is the infographic for the AWS shared-responsibility model; and here is the one for Microsoft Azure. Both models try to communicate that \u201cwe take care of the basics while you take care of what\u2019s under your control.\u201d In other words, AWS will ensure that S3 buckets can only be accessed consistent with the policy governing their use \u2013 and it is the customer\u2019s responsibility to set a policy appropriate to the data stored there. When delivering platform-as-a-service (PaaS) services on Azure, Microsoft\u2019s responsibility is to ensure that the OS used to deliver the service is patched and hardened.Now let\u2019s consider how these models work in real life by looking at three security bugs and how they impacted customers, which we can characterize as the good, the bad and the ugly.The Good\u2026Container-escape vulnerabilities enable an exploit to move beyond a container that an attacker has previously broken into. This is similar to an attacker crafting an exploit to escape a virtual machine (VM) and get into the hypervisor \u2013 thus gaining access to the contents of the underlying OS and other VMs running under the same hypervisor.An example is CVE-2019-5736, a bug in RunC, a building-block project for the container technologies used by many enterprises as well as public-cloud providers. In 2019, it patched a vulnerability that would allow root-level code-execution, container escape and access to the host filesystem.While the issue was reported more than two years ago, it is illustrative of a case where the shared-responsibility model worked to the advantage of public-cloud customers. The vulnerability and accompanying exploit were disclosed on Feb. 11, 2019, coincident with all the major cloud service providers patching the vulnerability. Organizations that ran containers in their own data centers had to scramble to patch their container OS images.The Bad\u2026More recently, in August, Microsoft made public a vulnerability reported in Azure Cosmos DB, the scalable NoSQL database delivered in a PaaS model. The vulnerability was in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB and thus only affected customers who had that feature enabled. Unfortunately, the Jupyter Notebook feature had automatically enabled for all Cosmos DBs created after February of this year, thus even exposing customers who didn\u2019t use the feature to a potential attack.The Cosmos DB service is effectively multi-tenant. Thus, data from multiple customers is co-mingled in the same service instance. Access to specific data is limited by simple software constructs, which were subverted in this case. This means that an attacker could sign up for an Azure account, fire up a Cosmos DB instance and exploit it to access data from all other customers\u2019 instances.This is an example of a vulnerability which is only encountered in the cloud, as it exists in a bespoke Azure PaaS service. And it highlights the fact that just because a company isn\u2019t actively using a particular feature (Jupyter Notebooks), that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not exposed to vulnerabilities within that feature.\u2026and the UglyIn September, Microsoft disclosed a series of vulnerabilities related to the Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) agent included in certain Linux virtual machine images it supplies to customers.The OMI agent is included in VM images supplied to customers based on which Azure services the customer intends to use. Microsoft however did not document the presence of the agent \u2014 even though the agent runs at the highest possible privilege level. In some instances (with certain Azure services enabled), it accepts connections via HTTPS across the internet.Collectively dubbed \u201cOMIGOD,\u201d the group of four vulnerabilities included one critical that rated a 9.8 out of a possible 10 on the CVSS bug-severity scale; it allows remote code execution.This is a case where a lack of transparency in a different kind of software supply chain (the stock VM images supplied by a cloud service provider) opens the VMs deployed by a customer to an extremely consequential attack. As if to reinforce that point, attacks on this vulnerability commenced almost immediately upon disclosure of the vulnerability and mitigation/patching had to be a coordinated affair \u2013 with Microsoft patching the Linux images it supplies and customers needing to patch already running versions of the old images.TakeawaysBeing on public clouds is good when a sweeping vulnerability such as the container escape is discovered. Cloud service providers are generally great at mitigating such issues at scale and the mitigation often involves little work by their customers. There are, however, significant security risks when running workloads in the public cloud as well.There is no guarantee that services delivered in a PaaS model are implemented in a hardened and secure manner. There is also great incentive for attackers to expend energy trying to break into such services as a discovered vulnerability is easily leveraged across a large set of targets.Furthermore, the incentive of the cloud service provider (to remove barriers standing in the way of more usage) and that of a user (to enable the minimal set of features) don\u2019t align. Thus, even Cosmos DB customers who never used or intended to use the Jupyter Notebook feature were exposed to a potential attack due to this dissonance in goals.While it may feel easy to trust them to get the shared-responsibility model right, there are clear recent examples where the trust has been misplaced. Treat all software you receive from cloud service providers with a healthy dose of skepticism \u2013 scan them and account for every open port and all present software packages.Oliver Tavakoli is CTO at Vectra AI.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.Cloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The CVE database reported 18,325 vulnerabilities in 2020. To add to this, more than 40% of the vulnerabilities do not even have a CVE identifier assigned, and open vulnerabilities on organizations\u2019 infrastructure are the most widely exploited pain points for malicious attacks \u2013 including ransomware. The irony is that many organizations rely on periodic vulnerability assessment activities, like performing scans bi-weekly, monthly, or quarterly, but following this process can take months to complete, ultimately leaving a massive gap for attackers to exploit. This is an example of routine (but random) methodologies and processes invented to keep vulnerabilities in check, but will not protect IT networks. It is essential to assess key areas, identify necessary components, and build a robust and automated vulnerability management program to safeguard your network from the growing attack surface.\u00a0To do that, below are some best practices to implement into your IT strategy for a robust vulnerability management program.A unified approach to both network and endpoint vulnerabilitiesA vulnerability is classified as any loophole in your network that is exploitable. Modern attackers explore multiple angles to achieve their attack objectives, whether that\u2019s a nation-state actor looking to disrupt critical infrastructure or a cybergang looking to make a quick few million dollars. Focusing on one area and neglecting the other will easily create security gaps.For example, traditional vulnerability management programs focus on remote scanning only and ignore vulnerabilities in the endpoints. With the changing work norms ushered in by the pandemic, endpoints have become an easy exploit target, and your vulnerability management program should give equal importance to managing both network and endpoint vulnerabilities. Many CISOs ignore software vulnerabilities considering them less critical to their security, but this opens gateways for attackers to intrude the network. Your vulnerability management program must manage vulnerabilities across all IP-enabled devices in your IT infrastructure.Continuous, ongoing and automated vulnerability assessment schedulesEvery day, numerous vulnerabilities are disclosed, and taking a periodic vulnerability assessment approach will not help you identify the most recent risks \u2013 it will actually keep you several steps behind in building security resilience. With the speed at which attackers can penetrate networks, a tiny gap is enough to execute an attack, and your vulnerability management process should be continuous and ongoing to avoid any unforeseen security risks. Opting for a solution that automates the vulnerability management routine will simplify the process and increase effectiveness.Speed and efficiency of vulnerability scannersVulnerability scanning is the foremost step in your vulnerability management process. Slow vulnerability scanners create a lag, slow business processes, and act as a major pitfall for any vulnerability management program. These scanners hinder IT security teams from running continuous scans. Along with this, the vast number of false positives provided by vulnerability scanners makes the entire process even more ineffective. The vulnerability scanner you choose should be rapid, efficient, compatible with your network infrastructure, and provide close to zero false positives.Breadth and comprehensiveness of a vulnerability databasePerforming vulnerability scanning based on CVE data alone is inaccurate and leads to false reporting. Vulnerability scanners must rely on a comprehensive database or a repository of security checks that perform a deep analysis on each vulnerability. As a result, vulnerability databases play a vital role in the vulnerability management program, and the quality of the vulnerability database determines the accuracy of your vulnerability assessment data. Consider using a comprehensive vulnerability database with coverage to both network and endpoint vulnerabilities and is regularly updated to identify the most recent vulnerability in your network.Risk-based vulnerability analysisTaking remediation efforts randomly without understanding the risks possessed by each vulnerability is not an intelligent approach to risk-based vulnerability analysis. Every IT infrastructure is unique and has varying risk levels based on access to the network, security tokens, and other elements. Your vulnerability assessment should focus on analyzing risk levels of all vulnerabilities and remediate the most critical ones first. Risk levels are calculated by considering various factors like threat intelligence, public ratings of vulnerabilities, assets in the enterprise, current exploit activities, and many more organization-specific factors.Additionally, a vulnerability assessment program should also meet the compliance standards set by regulatory agencies like HIPAA, PCI, NIST, and others.Vulnerability assessment must go beyond assessing only known vulnerabilitiesYour security exposure analysis should go beyond assessing only known vulnerabilities. Crucial activities like misconfiguration assessment, asset exposure analysis, and monitoring security control deviations must be a part of your IT security checklist.Integrated patch remediationThe most crucial step followed by vulnerability assessment is to remediate detected vulnerabilities. According to a recent study, 60% of breaches involve vulnerabilities for which a patch was available but not applied on time. Patching helps security teams reduce the attack surface significantly and helps prevent attacks. Your vulnerability management program should be equipped with an integrated patch management tool to remediate vulnerabilities on time, and the patching process safeguards networks from an array of potential attacks.Extensive report catalogTracking and monitoring the actions of your vulnerability management process will help you analyze what steps you need to take to adjust your IT security strategy. Insightful reports will help you review and evaluate your vulnerability management process and provide the necessary details of vulnerabilities in your network. Your vulnerability management program should offer an extensive range of reports for detailed study and analysis.Keeping in mind these key factors will help you evaluate your current vulnerability management program and guide you in making the necessary enhancements to your existing IT strategy. By implementing a robust, resilient, expansive, and automated vulnerability management program, you\u2019ll mitigate cyberattacks through minimizing vulnerability risk, ultimately protecting your company\u2019s and customers\u2019 information \u2013 and your reputation.SponsoredWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Attackers are actively exploiting a critical, pre-authorization remote-code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the popular Access Management platform from digital identity management firm ForgeRock.Access Management, a commercial access-management platform, is based on the OpenAM open-source access-management platform for web applications. The platform front-ends web apps and remote-access setups in many enterprises.On Monday morning, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that the vulnerability could enable attackers to execute commands in the context of the current user. The flaw can be found in Access Management versions below 7.0 running on Java 8. That means 6.0.0.x, 6.5.0.x, 6.5.1, 6.5.2.x and 6.5.3, as well as older, unsupported versions are all sitting ducks.Also on Monday, ForgeRock said in an updated security advisory that the flaw doesn\u2019t affect Access Management 7 and above. It only impacts a subset of ForgeRock customers who are using older versions of the company\u2019s Access Management product.An exploit for the critical vulnerability at the heart of the matter \u2013 CVE-2021-35464 \u2013 was first reported by Michael Stepankin, a researcher for the cybersecurity firm PortSwigger, on June 29. In his report, Stepankin explained that he created a new Ysoserial deserialization gadget chain specifically for the exploit.As GitHub details, Ysoserial is a proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization. Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization, in turn, is the reverse process: That\u2019s the mechanism whereby the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory, used to persist the object.Within hours of Stepankin\u2019s post on June 29, ForgeRock released a workaround and advisory to its customers to protect them from the vulnerability. On July 9, the company updated its advisory with a permanent fix.What a Dinky PoCIn his post, Stepankin summed up the flaw as an RCE made possible \u201cthanks to unsafe Java deserialization in the Jato framework used by OpenAM.\u201d The proof of concept (PoC) requires this single GET/POST request for code execution:GET /openam/oauth2/..;/ccversion/Version?jato.pageSession=<serialized_object>He said that an attacker who crafts such a request can send it to an exposed, remote endpoint in order to pull off RCE.The researcher discovered the vulnerability while looking into OAuth vulnerabilities. OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for people to sign into services without entering a password, by using signed-in status on another, trusted service or website. Examples include the \u201cSign in with Google\u201d or \u201cSign in with Facebook\u201d that many websites use in lieu of asking visitors to create a new account. These \u201cSign in\u201d or \u201cLog in\u201d prompts are called consent prompts.A year ago, Microsoft warned that during the pandemic, against the backdrop of widespread remote working and the increased use of collaboration apps, attackers were ramping up application-based attacks that exploit OAuth 2.0.With the help of a few scripts, Stepankin discovered all servers that respond to the \u201c/well-known/openid-configuration\u201d URI and checked out their configuration. He decided to focus on \u201ctruly impactful\u201d vulnerabilities: Hence, he zeroed in on systems that are either open-source or available to download and decompile. \u201cForgeRock OpenAm was one such system that I found in the bug bounty scope,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt appeared to me as a monstrous Java Enterprise application with a huge attack surface, so I decided to take a deeper look into it.\u201dHis takeaways from tackling the Java monster:Source code analysis and local testing are essential for finding issues like this one.URLDNS and JRMPClient gadget chains are the most universal for testing deserialization in Java.Even in solutions designed for authentication, you can find a big attack surface available without any auth.Automatic source code analysis tools are not sufficient if they don\u2019t cover dependencies.Java deserialization rocks.Patch AvailableOn Saturday, ForgeRock updated its advisory to advise users to take immediate action to either implement one of the workarounds or the patch as soon as possible.ForgeRock urged users to apply a workaround, to be applied \u201cimmediately\u201d to secure deployments, noting that the workarounds are suitable for all versions, including older, unsupported ones.Stepankin noted that the vulnerability was patched in ForgeRock AM version 7.0 \u201cby entirely removing the \u2018/ccvesion\u2019 endpoint, along with other legacy endpoints that use Jato.\u201dHe mentioned this big \u201cbut\u201d: \u201cJato framework has not been updated for many years, so all other products that rely on it may still be affected.\u201dThe researcher also noted that the flaw doesn\u2019t affect instances running with Java version 9 or newer, \u201csince Jato requires classes that have been removed in Java 9. It\u2019s one of the reasons why ForgeRock AM versions prior 7, such as 6.5, are still running on Java 8,\u201d he continued.Patch or WorkaroundUsers who can\u2019t patch can apply one of two workarounds that ForgeRock provided in its advisory.CISA recommends these steps for Access Management users to secure their platforms against the active, ongoing exploits:Review the ForgeRock Security Advisory and the Australian Cyber Security Centre Alert;Check for vulnerable instances of the Access Management software (see ForgeRock\u2019s Technical Impact Assessment); andPrioritize deploying an update to Access Management version 7 or apply the workaround urgently.Tasty TargetsMarcus Hartwig, manager of security analytics at cybersecurity firm Vectra, told Threatpost on Monday that identity and access management (IAM) platforms like OpenAM are \u201calways ripe targets for attackers since they allow attackers to access multiple downstream applications federated with the solution.\u201dAs well, Hartwig said in an email, \u201ceven if the compromised account lacks access to a specific application, many IAM solutions support creating new downstream accounts on applications through protocols like SCIM, which further allows attackers to progress their attacks.\u201dHe said that it\u2019s \u201cparamount\u201d for organizations that leverage IAM solutions for SSO into downstream applications to \u201cmonitor account behavior in their environs to detect attacks that circumvent the preventative security that Access Management solutions focus on.\u201d071221 16:19 UPDATE: Corrected the article to specify that there\u2019s a patch available.

        "raw text": "A zero-click security vulnerability in Apple\u2019s macOS Mail would allow a cyberattacker to add or modify any arbitrary file inside Mail\u2019s sandbox environment, leading to a range of attack types.According to Mikko Kentt\u00e4l\u00e4, founder and CEO of SensorFu, exploitation of the bug could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information to a third party; the ability to modify a victim\u2019s Mail configuration, including mail redirects which enables takeover of victim\u2019s other accounts via password resets; and the ability to change the victim\u2019s configuration so that the attack can propagate to correspondents in a worm-like fashion.Though the researcher is just now making the bug\u2019s details available, it was patched in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, macOS Catalina 10.15.5, so users should update accordingly.Unauthorized Write AccessKentt\u00e4l\u00e4 said he discovered the bug (CVE-2020-9922) by sending test messages and following Mail process syscalls.He found that \u201cmail has a feature which enables it to automatically uncompress attachments which have been automatically compressed by another Mail user,\u201d he explained. \u201cIn the valid use case, if the user creates email and adds the folder as an attachment it will be automatically compressed with ZIP and x-mac-auto-archive=yes; is added to the MIME headers. When another Mail user receives this email, compressed attachment data is automatically uncompressed.\u201dHowever, the researcher discovered that parts of the uncompressed data are not removed from the temporary directory \u2013 and that the directory serves multiple functions, allowing attackers to pivot within the environment.\u201c[It] is not unique in context of Mail, this can be leveraged to get unauthorized write access to ~/Library/Mail and to $TMPDIR using symlinks inside of those zipped files,\u201d Kentt\u00e4l\u00e4 explained.Zero-Click Attack PathTo exploit the bug, a cyberattacker could email two .ZIP files as attachments to the victim, according to the analysis. When a user receives the email, the Mail app will parse it to find any attachments with x-mac-auto-archive=yes header in place. Mail will then automatically unpack those files.\u201cThe first .ZIP includes a symlink named Mail which points to victims\u2019 $HOME/Library/Mail and file 1.txt,\u201d said Kentt\u00e4l\u00e4. \u201cThe .ZIP gets uncompressed to $TMPDIR/com.apple.mail/bom/. Based on the filename=1.txt.zip header, 1.txt gets copied to the mail director and everything works as expected. However, cleanup is not done right way and the symlink is left in place.\u201dThis left-behind symlink anchors the second stage of the attack.\u201cThe second attached .ZIP includes the changes that you want to do to $HOME/Library/Mail. This will provide arbitrary file write permission to Library/Mail,\u201d the researcher explained. \u201cIn my example case I wrote new Mail rules for the Mail application. With that you can add an auto forward rule to the victim\u2019s Mail application.\u201dThis arbitrary write access means that an attacker can manipulate all of the files in $HOME/Library/Mail, he added.CVE-2020-9922 is rated 6.5 on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale, making it medium-severity, but the researcher stressed that successful exploitation could \u201clead to many bad things.\u201d\u201cAs shown, this will lead to exposure of the sensitive data to a third party through manipulating the Mail application\u2019s configuration,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the available configuration options is the user\u2019s signature which could be used to make this vulnerability wormable. There is also a chance that this could lead to a remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerability, but I didn\u2019t go that far.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)\u00a0VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Cisco Systems released an updated patch for a critical vulnerability in its video and instant messaging platform Jabber, originally patched in September. The cross-site scripting bug could have allowed an adversary to execute arbitrary code by merely sending a specially-crafted chat message and compromise a target\u2019s system running the Jabber application.This critical bug \u201cdoes not require user interaction and is wormable, since the payload is delivered via an instant message,\u201d said the researchers at Watchcom who found the flaw. \u201cThis means that it can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction,\u201d they told Threatpost on Thursday.The bug impacts Cisco Jabber for Windows, Jabber for MacOS and the Jabber for mobile platforms. The flaw (CVE-2020-26085) has a CVSS score of 9.9 out of 10, making it critical in severity. Researchers with Watchcom, who discovered the flaw, said at the time of the original discovery the implications of the vulnerability are especially serious given the current pandemic-driven work-from-home trend.Two additional flaws, also patched in September, were also patched Thursday. Researchers at Watchcom, that originally found three of the bugs patched by Cisco, said they identified new ways to exploit the same flaws. Cisco also released additional patches, on Thursday, for high-severity bugs opening up Jabber to remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted systems.Click to register.Watchcom and Cisco both said they were not aware of any active exploitation of any of the bugs in the wild.Patch, Update, Patch and Repeat The Cisco Jabber vulnerabilities that are still open to exploitation are a cross-site scripting bug leading to RCE (CVE-2020-26085), with a 9.9 CVSS rating. The second is a password hash stealing information disclosure flaw (CVE-2020-27132), with a CVSS 6.5 severity rating. Cisco has also patched a custom protocol handler command injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-27133), rated high-severity with an CVSS rating of 8.8. An information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-27132), with a CVSS rating of medium, was also patched. Lastly, there is the protocol handler command injection vulnerability (CVE-2020-27127), with a CVSS severity-rating of 4.3.Updated patches are available via Cisco\u2019s Security Advisories support site.\u201cCisco released a patch that fixed the injection points we reported, but the underlying problem has not been fixed,\u201d wrote Watchcom researchers about the three vulnerabilities it identified (CVE-2020-26085, CVE-2020-27132, CVE-2020-27127) in September and re-identified as vulnerable to attack.\u201cWe were able to find new injection points that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities. All currently supported versions of the Cisco Jabber client (12.1 \u2013 12.9) are affected. The three vulnerabilities have been assigned new CVE numbers to distinguish them from the vulnerabilities disclosed in September,\u201d researchers wrote.Both the original discovery of the vulnerabilities and the \u2018re-discovery\u2019 were made during security audits for a client, researchers said.Nightmare Attack ScenarioIn order to exploit these vulnerabilities, all a hacker needs to be able to send a Jabber chat message to the victim, Watchcom describes.\u201cThis could happen if the targeted company allows adding contacts outside of the organization or if the attacker gains access to an employee\u2019s Jabber username and password,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cOnce the attacker is able to send chat messages, he can take full control over the computers of everyone in the organization. The person receiving the message does not have to do anything, the attackers malicious code will run automatically once the message is received.\u201dTo exploit the two Jabber message handling vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-26085, CVE-2020-27132) an attacker would need to send an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) message to a system running the Cisco Jabber client. \u201cAttackers may require access to the same XMPP domain or another method of access to be able to send messages to clients,\u201d Cisco noted.Next, an attacker can cause the Jabber application to \u201crun an arbitrary executable that already exists within the local file path of the application,\u201d researchers said. The executable would run on the end-user system with the privileges of the user who initiated the Cisco Jabber client application, Watchcom wrote. Systems using Cisco\u00a0Jabber in phone-only mode without XMPP messaging services enabled are not vulnerable to exploitation.Breaking Down the BugsThe most serious of the bugs (CVE-2020-26085), a cross-site scripting flaw, impacts Cisco Jabber for Windows and Cisco Jabber for MacOS. The flaw allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute programs on a targeted system.\u201cThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted XMPP messages to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute arbitrary programs on the targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software, possibly resulting in arbitrary code execution,\u201d Cisco wrote.Watchcom said that flaw can be exploited to achieve RCE by escaping the client\u2019s Chromium-based sandbox. Worse, is the fact the attack vector would be zero-click, wormable via an instant message and can be used to automatically spread malware without any user interaction.The high-severity bug, tracked as CVE-2020-27134 by Cisco, is a message handling script injection vulnerability. Vulnerable is the Cisco Jabber for Windows, MacOS, and mobile platforms. The bug allows an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary script and potentially execute arbitrary commands on some platforms, Cisco said.\u201cThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of message contents. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted XMPP messages to the affected software. By convincing a targeted user to interact with a message, an attacker could inject arbitrary script code within the Jabber message window interface,\u201d according to the Cisco bulletinCisco explained the vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. \u201cExploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities,\u201d it wrote in its\u00a0 Cisco Security Advisory Thursday.A second high-severity bug (CVE-2020-27133), effecting Cisco Jabber for Windows, is tied to improper handling of input to the application protocol handlers. According to Cisco, this could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.\u201cAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a link within a message sent by email or other messaging platform. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system with the privileges of the user account that is running the Cisco Jabber client software,\u201d Cisco said.Discover, Disclosure TimelineWatchcom said the timeline for the vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-26085, CVE-2020-27132, CVE-2020-27127) it originally found and then rediscovered is:2nd September 2020: Original vulnerabilities publicly disclosed.

        "raw text": "A security vulnerability in the infrastructure underlying Germany\u2019s official COVID-19 contact-tracing app, called the Corona-Warn-App (CWA), would have allowed pre-authenticated remote code execution (RCE).Researcher Alvaro Mu\u00f1oz wrote in a report this week that he and his team at GitHub Security Lab was chasing down RCE vulnerabilities on the platform and found one in the infrastructure supporting CWA for Android and OS. The team said it worked with SAP to mitigate the issue, adding as a server-side issue, the mobile apps themselves were not impacted, and that no data was collected beyond a device\u2019s IP address.\u201cThere appeared to be a pre-authentication RCE vulnerability in Corona-Warn-App Server, which drives Germany\u2019s COVID-19 contact-tracing application infrastructure,\u201d\u00a0 according to Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cThis vulnerability had the potential to affect the integrity of Germany\u2019s COVID-19 response and as such warranted an immediate response from our team.\u201dThe BugThe vulnerable code was located in the Submission Service, which is a micro service developed on top of the Spring Boot framework responsible for validating the information that CWA users submit.This uses a function called the SubmissionController, which verifies various aspects of the user-supplied information, such as making sure all mandatory fields are filled out. The data isvalidated by the \u201cValidSubmissionPayload\u201d validator.\u201cAs explained in our previous research on Java Bean Validation vulnerabilities, if any validated bean properties flow into a custom constraint violation template, [an] attacker-controlled property will be evaluated as an Expressional Language (EL) expression, which allows for the evaluation of arbitrary Java code,\u201d the researcher explained.This turns out to be the case for two of the validation checks on the user supplied submissions: One checks to make sure that the \u201cvisited countries\u201d information is valid, and the other checks to make sure the origin country is valid.The upshot, the researcher said, is that any POST requests sent to the Submission endpoint are allowed by default and require no further authorization or authentication. And the Submission endpoint itself is publicly exposed, allowing remote contact.CWA was commissioned by the German government and built by SAP and Deutsche Telekom using the GitHub development platform. It functions by exchanging anonymous tokens through the exposure notification API from Apple and Google, over Bluetooth Low Energy. The log is saved for 14 days. If the user tests positive, the anonymous log is submitted to the CWA server, which keeps track of exposure and can then, in turn, alert people to isolate after a set amount of exposure.\u201cThe app informs us if we have had contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19,\u201d according to the CWA site. \u201cIt protects us and others around us, as well as our privacy.\u201dThe app was released in June after only 50 days in development, according to SAP. The timeline was supercharged by making the open-source project available to the public on GitHub.\u201cMore than 109,000 visitors viewed the code and approximately 7,250 community and project members participated,\u201d SAP said in a statement in June about the app\u2019s release. \u201cThe Corona-Warning-App is the largest open-source project ever implemented in Germany on behalf of the German government.\u201dFor their part, GitHub is touting the finding of the bug as a success for both open source and the fight against COVID-19.\u201cThis research is yet another example of open source saving the day \u2013 without involving the broader development community, GitHub Security Lab would not have been able to discover and help fix this vulnerability, risking a mission critical piece of infrastructure in the global fight against COVID-19,\u201d Jamie Cool, vice president of product management, security at GitHub told Threatpost.Contact-Tracing and PrivacyPrivacy concerns have been a barrier to adoption of contact-tracing apps, which require widespread use to be valuable. People are leery about handing over their location data to government entities.In Sept., the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation warned about the possible implications of contact tracing apps to be used to stifle free speech protections, specifically calling out California\u2019s lack of privacy considerations in developing a tracing app for the state.\u201cPrivacy protections are necessary to public health programs, particularly when a program needs high levels of participation to be effective,\u201d EFF\u2019s Hayley Tsukayama wrote in a blog post in Sept. \u201cPeople will not use applications they can\u2019t trust. That\u2019s why EFF and other privacy groups have called on Governor Newsom to place basic privacy guardrails on any contact-tracing program run by or with the state.\u201dAlso, Utah\u2019s \u201cHealthy Together\u201d app was slammed last May for throwing out the Google and Apple API which assigns an anonymous identifier beacon to protect privacy and instead using\u00a0 a system developed for a social-networking site which critics said collected gobs of user location data.Mu\u00f1oz said building these applications on open source not only offers transparency to users about what data is being collected and where its going, but it also allows others to help spot security holes, which in turn builds critical public trust.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Sometimes vulnerability disclosure goes well \u2014 and sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Security researchers still face legal action for \u201chacking\u201d when reporting the bugs they find \u2014 as is the case with a flaw recently reported to the Giggle social network. However \u2014 while the vendor-researcher relationship is still fraught with pitfalls, the good news is that things are slowly starting to get better, say experts.Notably, the Giggle news (detailed below) comes as releases of vulnerability-disclosure policies (VDPs) have snowballed, with names like Facebook and the U.S. government embracing transparent guidelines for ethical bug-hunting.Giggle: No Laughing Security MatterIn a blog post on Thursday, Saskia Coplans, a founder at a majority-female security firm called Digital Interruption (DI), described a disclosure effort in which the company reached out to Giggle about a privacy flaw. Giggle, which bills itself as a social network \u201cfor girls,\u201d offers various female-specific topic areas and communities, including those for victims of abuse and for sex workers. The down side is, according to its privacy policy, Giggle collects all kinds of information about users, including geolocation, personal preferences, demographic data and answers to surveys.That\u2019s a problem given that the bug that DI found would allow unverified attackers to trivially access this personal information on the platform from anywhere. To boot, the researchers found that the information was still accessible/stored even after a user deleted an account. DI researchers understandably felt it was important to report the issue to prevent exploitation by abusers and others.The public tweet that started the furor.So they did just that, first reaching out via Twitter in a direct message to the company. When there was no response after two days, DI published a public tweet directing the company and its founder, Australian screenwriter Sall Grover, to the DM. The researchers also mentioned the company\u2019s perceived anti-trans stance \u2014 Giggle uses facial recognition and AI to determine if a user is female or not, which is a \u201ctest\u201d many trans women can\u2019t pass \u2014 and that\u2019s when the problems began.\u201cOur public tweet had no engagement at all until Sall, the Giggle founder, decided to share a screenshot of it with her followers. We have since been subject to a tirade of abuse,\u201d according to the blog. \u201cOur three-year incorporated company has been accused of being a creepy bloke who runs private WhatsApp groups full of naked women, a front for the alt-left, making up the vuln to discredit Sall and her company, and hypocrites for wanting to protect the data of users despite the app\u2019s founder having views that counter our own.\u201dCoplans added that none of the responses mentioned the actual security issue itself.DI went on to attempt contact nonetheless, but was blocked at every attempt \u2014 the firm also asked Troy Hunt of HaveIBeenPwned the to plead its case to the company. Eventually, someone at Giggle did fix the bug.\u201cNo one reached out,\u201d Jahmel Harris, a DI founder and security researcher, told Threatpost. \u201cEven though we sent Sall/Giggle some details right at the start of this, we don\u2019t know if these weren\u2019t passed to the [development team] as Sall (the owner) didn\u2019t seem to understand what I was saying. Based on a recent email with the dev, it sounds like he figured it out based on some of the Twitter noise. We were only able to send full details and a proof of concept after Troy Hunt had asked Sall on our behalf if she would allow us to email her, but by this point it sounded like it had been fixed.\u201dGiggle has also threatened DI with legal action \u2013though it\u2019s unclear what the allegations will be.\u201cThey\u2019ve claimed they\u2019ve sent all communications to a lawyer and I believe it\u2019s because we published a blog post, not for finding the vulnerability,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI should note that we only published after the issue was fixed.\u201dThreatpost has contacted Giggle and asked for comment, but as of press time, there has been no response.Noted vulnerability-disclosure expert and CEO at Luta Security, Katie Moussouris, weighed in on Twitter, calling the disclosure experience the \u201cworst of the year.\u201dWorst vulnerability disclosure experience of the year so far.The researchers took pains to avoid accessing others\u2019 data & made it clear this wasn\u2019t an attempt to collect cash.Demonstrable Stages of Denial & Anger in the 5 Stages of Vuln Disclosure Grief from Giggle, the TERFs https://t.co/aI596J7K05 pic.twitter.com/csYPinSyHz\u2014 Katie Moussouris (she/her) (@k8em0) September 10, 2020VDPs to the ForeAs the Giggle debacle demonstrates, researchers are still being sued on occasion. Yet at the same time, this level of difficulty is a rarity, according to DI\u2019s Harris.\u201cHonestly\u2026it\u2019s becoming easier to report vulnerabilities to companies now that we have Katie Moussouris and companies like HackerOne and Bugcrowd putting in a lot of effort to protect security researchers,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cWe\u2019re always going to see companies act like this, but changes in the law can go a long way helping report issues and vulnerability-coordination and bug-bounty platforms will often act as a mediator. This is the first time we\u2019ve had an experience as intense as this. Mostly companies that don\u2019t have much experience with this will at least be thankful we\u2019re disclosing privately. It\u2019s easy to understand this can be a fairly scary experience for a company, but if there is a defined way to respond to security researchers or vuln hunters, it\u2019s often a case of fixing the vuln, thanking them and moving on.\u201dTo that end, Facebook, the State of Ohio, a top voting-machine vendor and the U.S. federal government have all embraced VDPs in recent days \u2014 showing that the ethical hacking landscape is indeed improving.Click to RegisterBy way of definition, VDPs are the latest step for many in the evolution of the vendor-researcher relationship. The industry has seen the rise of bug-bounty programs that pay researchers for their work; and there have also been more safe-harbor policies put into place to protect researchers from legal action. And, responsible disclosure policies have rolled out at many organizations, meant to protect vendors and avoid the disclosure of flaws before there are patches available. A VDP collects all of these factors and more into a centralized, written policy on dealing with disclosures.Illustrating this, last week, Facebook rolled out a VDP that clarifies how Facebook bug-hunters will deal with flaws that they find in third-party software and open-source projects. Specifically, the tech giant said that it will implement a 90-day policy between a bug being reported and going public. At the same time, Facebook-owned WhatsApp debuted a security disclosure page that will act as a central repository for any bugs found in that platform.\u201cFacebook\u2019s VDP addresses vulnerabilities of third parties, which helps to normalize vulnerability disclosure,\u201d security researcher and bug-hunter Mike Takahashi told Threatpost. \u201cIf those contacted are responsive, it should only benefit them to receive these reports. Inevitably there will be examples where organizations are not responsive or aren\u2019t taking reasonable steps to fix the vulnerabilities. When this happens there will be growing pains from the ensuing chaos of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities without a fix in place.\u00a0 This will open the door for black-hat hackers to exploit a vulnerability which they may not have known about otherwise, but also gives organizations an opportunity to be proactive with their own mitigations before an official fix is released.\u201dThere have also been recent moves around election infrastructure; in August, Ohio\u2019s secretary of state issued a VDP to cover the state\u2019s election-related websites, the first such move by a state; and, Election Systems & Software, the biggest vendor of U.S. voting equipment,\u00a0issued a VDP\u00a0last month covering ES&S\u2019s corporate systems and public-facing websites (though not voting machines and other equipment that\u2019s already deployed in the field).\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more mainstream and more tech companies are starting to understand this is just part of the ecosystem,\u201d DI\u2019s Harris said.Meanwhile, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has mandated that federal agencies must implement VDPs by next March, which would give ethical hackers clear guidelines for submitting bugs found in government systems \u2013 and hopefully encourage more bug-hunting overall.CISA\u2019s announcement also drew praise from the bug-bounty community.\u201cThe government is leaping ahead of much of corporate America\u2026We will look back on this moment years from now to recognize it as a turning point in America\u2019s fight for trustworthy technology.\u201d Alex Rice, CTO and co-founder HackerOne, told Threatpost via email. \u201cHackerOne believes that CISA\u2019s Binding Operational Directive is a pivotal milestone in the mission to restore trust in digital democracy and protect the integrity of federal information systems. Every organization, especially those protecting sensitive information, should have a public-facing way to report potential security gaps. Collaboration with the hacker community provides a crucial advantage: having someone on your team who thinks like an attacker.\u201dCasey Ellis, CTO at ethical hacking platform Bugcrowd, added: \u201cThose who have both the skills and altruistic interest to identify cyber-risk and improve the safety and security of the internet have been waiting patiently for the better part of 30 years [for acceptance], and our efforts to help have been met with varying responses.\u201d In an August filing with CISA, he noted, \u201cUp until five or six years years ago many of them were fearful, hostile and negative. The evolution of the information attack surface and the capabilities of our adversaries have caused a huge shift: The internet realized that all \u201chackers\u201d aren\u2019t burglars, many of them are actually locksmiths.\u201dVDPs in Context\u00a0While the VDP moves are net positives for cybersecurity, the juxtaposition of VDP rollouts with Giggle issue shows that VDPs aren\u2019t simply a blanket golden ticket to a harmonious vendor-researcher relationship, researchers noted. There are many things that can go wrong if the policy doesn\u2019t provide enough transparency and clarity.For instance, less scrupulous researchers may publish details on a zero-day bug or even proof-of-concept exploits for unpatched issues without coordinating with a vendor, even if the vendor has a VDP and bounty program in place. Such was the case with SandBoxEscaper, who published a spate of zero-day exploits for Microsoft bugs in 2018 and 2019.On the flip side, vendors may not respond to a report, leaving researchers in a tough situation. Some providers and vendors, like Giggle, don\u2019t want to deal with the issue at all; but others may not provide full patches in a timely fashion. For instance, recently researchers disclosed bugs in Grandstream products for small- and medium-sized businesses even though the issues weren\u2019t fully patched, after the firm\u2019s 90-day disclosure window expired.The Facebook VDP allows for a raft of exceptions to its 90-day window, including reserving the right to disclose a bug if a vendor doesn\u2019t respond within 21 days of a report being filed.\u201cAn issue that could be improved is vulnerability remediation speed; the industry standard is often 90 days from disclosure to being made public,\u201d Charles Ragland, security engineer at Digital Shadows, told Threatpost. \u201cThere are many high-profile instances where patches either weren\u2019t released or were barely released within this 90-day window. That\u2019s a long time for an exploitable vulnerability to be exposed, and it\u2019s likely that if one person figured it out, someone else will, too.\u201dDifferent researchers also may have different policies on the latter scenario, potentially leading to confusion as vendors juggle multiple reports from multiple parties with different timelines.\u201cWhether or not you have an official VDP, it can be a challenge is keeping up with outside reports,\u201d Takahashi said. \u201cThis includes being responsive in communication with white-hat hackers and fixing any vulnerabilities. In the two years we\u2019ve seen a huge increase in security issues in the news stemming from mismanagement of vulnerability disclosure. If vulnerability disclosures aren\u2019t taken seriously, they can end up being very costly when they\u2019re publicly disclosed.\u201dVendors also need to balance many factors in developing and testing patches, according to Brian Gorenc, senior director of vulnerability research for Trend Micro and head of Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).\u201cSeverity is one of those factors, and researcher may judge severity differently than the vendor,\u201d he told Threatpost in an email interview. \u201cAlternatively, there are times when vendors want to ignore or downplay certain reports and focus on developing new products. There needs to be more understanding on the process on both sides to prevent confusion \u2013 and that confusion leads to distrust and hard feelings.\u201dDI\u2019s Harris also noted the true downsides if companies don\u2019t embrace VDPs and other ethical-hacking measures.\u201cWe understand people have great ideas and want to create applications to meet that need, but it can be very dangerous to move ahead with some of those ideas without getting proper security advice and support,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cIf [Giggle] had been built with security in mind from the start, they could have still achieved what they wanted to do without putting vulnerable women in danger. Sall disregarded our report, putting the users of the application at risk and denied that a vulnerability was present without investigating. In our opinion, this is a breach of trust. By making it into a \u2018fight\u2019 between them and us, they actually encouraged others to look for the vulnerability. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if, unfortunately, it was exploited before it was fixed because of the way Sall and Giggle responded.\u201d\u00a0Best PracticesTransparency with both the researcher and the public is a crucial factor to minimizing distrust and making VDPs effective, and Gorenc noted that there are industry best practices that should also be followed. These are laid out in the ISO 29147 standard, which includes guidance for both filing reports and receiving them. For instance: Providing clear boundaries for security researchers in terms of ethical hacking; offering clarity on what is in scope and what\u2019s not; and specifying how long a researcher must wait before disclosing publicly, even if there is no patch available.\u201cHaving a well-defined vulnerability disclosure policy is definitely something every agency receiving bug reports should have,\u201d Gorenc said, referring to the just-announced government mandate to implement VDPs at all agencies. \u201cLet\u2019s hope [CISA] follows the guidelines set out in ISO 29147 and establishes a robust program rather than just checking boxes to be in compliance.\u201dGetting companies interested in developing bug-bounty programs or even simply paying attention to independent researchers reaching out in good faith can still be difficult, Ragland noted, adding that \u201cmaking the process difficult and obtuse burns people out and leads to more ignored vulnerabilities.\u201dThus, independent bug-bounty programs \u2013 like those run by HackerOne, Bugcrowd or ZDI \u2013 can help vendors by providing them access to an established VDP and bounty program.\u201cVendor-agnostic bug-bounty programs can serve as intermediaries and provide an honest broker for researcher and vendor alike,\u201d Gorenc said. \u201cFor example, with our program, researchers know their report won\u2019t be ignored. At the same time, vendors know a report from us won\u2019t go public unless our 120-day timeline is disregarded.\u201dOverall, expectations need to improve \u2013 both for researchers and vendors \u2013 and appropriately structured VDPs can be a big key to that, he said.\u201cThere are still too many \u2018surprises\u2019 in vulnerability disclosure,\u201d Gorenc noted. \u201cResearchers are surprised by a vendor\u2019s response (or lack thereof), and vendors are surprised by a researcher\u2019s disclosure. We as an industry have been doing disclosure long enough that there should be no surprises.\u201dOn Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.\u00a0Bug BountyGovernmentHacksVulnerabilities",

Also this week, WhatsApp debuted a\u00a0new dedicated security advisory site aimed at informing its more than 2 million users about bugs and keeping them updated on app security.In this week\u2019s Threatpost Podcast, ZDI head\u00a0Brian Gorenc and communications manager Dustin Childs talk about why the IoT and industrial IoT markets are still a pain point for ethical hackers trying to disclose flaws, as well as what\u2019s considered appropriate when it comes to public disclosure, and share their craziest Pwn2Own bug stories.Below find a lightly edited transcript of the article.Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch:\u00a0Welcome back to the Threatpost podcast. This is Lindsey O\u2019Donnell Welch with Threatpost. And I\u2019m joined today by Brian Gorenc, senior director of vulnerability research for Trend Micro and head of the Zero Day Initiative. And Dustin Childs, who is the Communications Manager for Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative. Brian and Dustin, thank you so much for joining me today.Dustin Childs: You\u2019re welcome. Thanks for having us.Brian Gorenc: Yeah, thanks for having us. We\u2019re excited to be here.Lindsey: Great. So, so we\u2019re going to talk about ZDI or Zero Day Initiative today, it\u2019s been 15 years since ZDI was launched in 2005. And when it was first launched, the plan was to financially reward researchers who found previously unknown software flaws, aka zero days, and disclose them responsibly. So tell us a little bit about the ZDI program and how it works and kind of how it first got started all those years ago.Brian: Well, yeah, the Zero Day Initiative program, back in 2005, what we noticed is that there was a global community out there of independent researchers who were looking for zero day vulnerabilities and really didn\u2019t have an avenue of which to disclose that information to the vendors. And they also would not be getting compensated for the work that they were doing. And what we noticed is, we wanted to incorporate that type of research into what we were doing for the tipping point IPS. And so what we did is we decided we would encourage the reporting of zero day vulnerabilities to effective vendors by financially rewarding researchers out there by having them submit them to us here at the Zero Day Initiative. What this would allow us to do is it would allow us to get an understanding of the zero day vulnerabilities that were being discovered out there by that community and it would allow us to amplify the effectiveness of our team by crowdsourcing vulnerability and exploit intelligence from that community. At the same time, we would, once we financially come compensated those researchers, we would actually work with the vendor to make sure that they would actually fix the vulnerability that had been discovered and kind of educate them on the process of responsible disclosure, and allowing us to protect the customers from harm until the effective vendor actually had shipped the patch.Lindsey: Right. Yeah, Brian, that\u2019s really interesting. Now back all the way in, you know, 2005, it was a bit of a different vulnerability disclosure landscape. And there is kind of a perception by some in the information security space that those who are finding the vulnerabilities were malicious hackers looking to do harm. What did the vulnerability disclosure landscape look like back then, at the time when this program was being launched?Dustin: \u00a0It was definitely a different landscape. So back then people were definitely looking at the vulnerabilities but the disclosure wasn\u2019t as mature as it is now. So even when they were finding stuff, it wasn\u2019t clear what they were supposed to do with it. So there were a lot of misunderstandings between researchers and vendors and bug bounty programs and all of the various players, and really, who was hurting the most was the customers who ended up getting impacted by this. So our program really helped establish a way to coordinate disclosure and kind of mature that process. So, but it was definitely very, very different, because it was, there just weren\u2019t rules set up and there weren\u2019t established procedures, there wasn\u2019t experience. So there was a lot of hurt feelings and a lot of misunderstandings from various people throughout the whole community.Lindsey: Right. Yeah, I\u2019m sure over the years you saw, there have obviously been a couple of incidents where vulnerability disclosure goes wrong when it comes to, researchers who are reporting vulnerabilities to companies and then get threatened to get sued or other things might happen. So can you talk a little bit about how the landscape has kind of changed over the past 15 years since that time, especially, now we\u2019re seeing more bug bounty service companies gain traction and more bug bounty programs pop up and even companies creating their own vulnerability disclosure policies and whatnot.Dustin: Right. It really has shifted since over the last 15 years. And when we first started, it was it was controversial and bug bounties themselves were controversial. The really bad analogy that people used a lot of times was, \u201cwell, it\u2019s like somebody comes by and paints your porch and knocks on your door and asks to be paid for work you didn\u2019t ask them to do\u201d and, of course, that\u2019s a very poor analogy and not what bug bounties are at all \u2013 it\u2019s really outsourcing and crowdsourcing a lot of security research. So over the years, it\u2019s really normalized and people have begun to understand the bug bounties are a valuable part of any sort of response process. But vendors have also gone a long way to doing this. I mean, when Microsoft came out and said \u201cwe won\u2019t sue researchers who report to us legitimately.\u201d Not every person, not every vendor has picked up on that, we still occasionally will have to deal with a lawyer. We had one company even this year, a little unhappy to participate in our upcoming Pwn2Own. So that was interesting to kind of work them through the process and like, let them know that they don\u2019t really get to choose not to participate. But again it\u2019s an experience, and it\u2019s an understanding and it\u2019s a maturing of the entire process throughout the industry. So it really has shifted a lot so that bug bounties where they once were controversial, are now normalized. To the point where you see the United Airlines, having a bug bounty program, General Motors has a bug bounty program, Tesla has a bug bounty program. So all of these people that you wouldn\u2019t normally associate with bug bounty programs have some form of formally doing the vulnerability disclosure process and financially compensating the researchers or at least recognizing them in some way.Brian: And I also think it\u2019s interesting when you look at the maturity of the industry is based off of the verticals that we actually operate in. So you\u2019ll see enterprise software has a certain way that they respond. Whereas Microsoft and Adobe and Apple, some of these big name players in the industry have a much more mature process. But if we look at say, like the ICS, or the SCADA world, the maturity process for vulnerability disclosure in that part of the market is not as mature as the Microsoft\u2019s and Adobe\u2019s of the world. And as a result, what we\u2019re seeing is, each industry maturing at its own rate, each one learning from the lessons of the other industries that are out there, and we\u2019re hoping that you know, as a total, the entire software community will actually be able to respond a lot faster in the future, based off of some of the work that the bounty programs are doing now. And in the process of vulnerability disclosure.Lindsey: Right, that\u2019s a really good point in terms of \u2013 and I know too, for ICS and SCADA they on their end, they might have a little more complications, trying to patch and what that means for downtime of their systems and whatnot \u2013 But that\u2019s a good point to really point out kind of that variation between different industries and how they\u2019re responding and different companies. How has ZDI seen, based on the researchers coming to you with different vulnerabilities and how the companies are responding to those vulnerabilities, are you seeing any kind of overarching changes over the past few years, in terms of kind of the relationships between the security research community and the white hat hacker community and the companies that they are finding vulnerabilities and kind of disclosing them within?Brian: I think if you look at the companies that are adopting the bug bounty programs and the ones that are kind of reaching out to the research community for guidance, you can see them trying to point them in the direction of which products they want research in. Take Microsoft for example. They\u2019ll have by bounty programs for HyperV and some of the cloud technology out there that they\u2019re running as a vendor. You know, we in ZDI, consider ourselves vendor agnostic. So what we\u2019re looking for is vulnerabilities in enterprise software and things that are affecting our customers, other companies, the bug bounty as a service companies, are looking for vulnerabilities in what they\u2019re being paid to look for. So researchers can identify and find the areas and the programs that best work with their skill set, and try to maximize the amount of money that they\u2019re making through the research that they\u2019re doing. And also help highlight issues in some of the technology that the vendors themselves are actually very interested in finding.Dustin: And to go along with that. I mean, a few years ago, we saw the enterprise companies really embrace the security researcher community. And we\u2019re starting to see that now like at Pwn2Own Miami this year, we had the ICS World start to understand, and kind of make some of those connections with the security researcher community as well. I think we have yet to see that in the IoT world. But that\u2019s probably going to be the next area where they really start to embrace this idea of an outsourced security research component that they can tap into.Lindsey: I also wanted to talk about public disclosure, and that whole process as well, I know ZDI has you have a policy where you allow the vendor 120 days to address the flaw with a security patch, or other corrective measure. Can you talk a little bit about this process of public disclosure and why this amount of time versus more or less, and kind of public disclosure in the security space in general?Brian: Yeah, I think, you know, back when we first started releasing zero days advisories for bugs that were not fixed, we were actually doing it at 180 days. And so when that happened, there was a lot of vendors out there that weren\u2019t addressing the issues that we were reporting to them and we got tired of them not admitting at least to the issue and releasing fixes for them. So we placed that timeline on them to kind of enforce them to, to make a fix happen. And what we learned over the years is that the vendors would actually respond to this type of activity and start to work against that timeline and start releasing patches right before the timeline was up. And so these types of timelines are actually very valuable for vendors, they actually give them a set timeline in which they can actually work and try to schedule it within the software releases that they\u2019re doing. And over time, what we noticed is that vendors were getting better and better. And so as we analyze the data coming in from the ZDI program, we actually adjusted our timeline down to 120 days to keep the pressure on the vendors, to ensure that they would release a patch in a timely fashion. And you see other bug bounty program and other research organizations taking a different approach is that this some have 90 day timelines and some have no timelines, we prescribed to the 120 day timeline based off of the data that we have in our program and how the industries are responding to vulnerabilities that are coming from our program.Dustin: And looking at disclosure as a whole, generically speaking, it\u2019s our opinion, disclosure should drive action. And disclosure takes a lot of forms, that sometimes you don\u2019t even realize Adobe and Microsoft disclose bugs every second Tuesday of the month. And the action there is apply the security patch. So it\u2019s very simple \u2013 disclosure driving action. For us, when we disclose something, we want to encourage an action and maybe it is changing that timeline, from 180 to 120. Or maybe it\u2019s getting information out there that people need to know, to make change configuration or to apply a patch, or to put pressure on a vendor to release a patch. We\u2019ve had instances where we\u2019ve had disagreements with vendors on severity and stuff and said \u201cokay, well, we\u2019re going to disclose this,\u201d and we go public with it. And then the vendor has a change of heart and they release a patch a week later. So clearly that\u2019s a time where disclosure is driving action. But if you\u2019re not driving action with your disclosure, you need to ask yourself, what are you doing with that disclosure, if you\u2019re not driving an action \u2013 if you\u2019re just making noise, we\u2019re kind of against that. So that\u2019s why we think disclosure should drive action. It\u2019s why we have the 120 day disclosure timeline to make sure that vendors don\u2019t just ignore the reports. But it also gives them a reasonable amount to actually produce effects.Lindsey: Yeah, Dustin, that\u2019s a really good point. And I think it\u2019s interesting too, that there are these varying ideas of what is appropriate bug disclosure and some researchers over the past year will release you know, PoC exploit code for unpatched bugs or others will disclose flaws without giving vendors enough time to respond or some will have, as you mentioned before, they\u2019ll go by the 90 day disclosure policy or 120 days or whatnot. Do you ever see there being more of a consensus within the security space about what is appropriate versus not appropriate?Dustin: I don\u2019t know that the that our community will come to an agreement about anything. So I don\u2019t, I would like to think that we would continue to have multiple voices, continuing to have the conversation, maybe one day we can get it, our data will say that 90 days is the appropriate timeline, and others can back that up on it. I really hope we have multiple voices and continue to have the conversation, but have our decisions be driven by data and not by fear, or, looking to make a name for yourself or whatever. So I don\u2019t know that there ever will truly be a consensus because there\u2019s a lot of opinion and a lot of data that is not shared between organizations. So we\u2019re not all looking at the same thing, making decisions off the same pieces of information.Lindsey: Right, right. That\u2019s fair. Now, beyond bug disclosure, what are some top challenges that are existing for security researchers who are looking to disclose vulnerabilities?Dustin: Well the Wassenaar Arrangement has certainly changed some of the disclosure [policies] especially if you\u2019re one of those countries that is participating in the Wassenaar Arrangement, you have some additional paperwork that you need to fill out. And we\u2019ve learned to deal with that over the years. There\u2019s also, just as a researcher right now, there\u2019s so much out there. Do you work with a vendor agnostic program? Do you go for a vendor specific program? Do you work with bug bounty as a service? Do you participate in CTFs? There\u2019s a lot of options. And that\u2019s not even getting into like the gray market with bug brokers. And then there\u2019s the, well \u201cwhat happens to my research after I sell it to this broker who resells it to a government, etc.?\u201d That\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re seeing right now is there\u2019s just so much out there, that researchers are having a hard time even knowing where to begin, if they\u2019re just getting into it. And then, you know, how do they navigate this now almost saturated field?Brian: Yeah, that\u2019s one of the value props for a program like the Zero Day Initiative is we\u2019re actually a single source for disclosure to multiple vendors. And we see a lot of researchers out there who will work with us on with disclosure to multiple vendors in different industries and we kind of are able to act as a middleman and making sure that their research actually gets to the vendor, actually gets addressed. And an advisory released with the proper, you know, acknowledgments and patches being released to the customers.Dustin: \u00a0Yeah, and going back to like the emerging industries for a lot of places in ICS SCADA or IoT, it\u2019s not very clear where to submit your research for the established \u2013 the Apple\u2019s, the Microsoft\u2019s, the Googles, you know where to send an email saying, \u201cHey, I found this bug and want to report it,\u201d for a lot of places in SCADA, in IoT, they just, it\u2019s not very clear where to submit your research.Brian: Again, this comes back to the maturity of those different verticals that we were talking about earlier in the conversation. Now, hopefully we\u2019ll see over time that the ICS you know, vendors will have better adopted the process that the other vendors are using.Lindsey:\u00a0Shifting gears back to the Zero Day Initiative. Can you talk about some of the kind of more interesting stories that you\u2019ve seen or the most unique bugs that have been discovered through your program over the past 15 years?Dustin: There\u2019s been a lot, Brian, once you start with the IE mitigation bypass.Brian: Yeah, I think that, you know, for us, you know, for myself and for a couple of the researchers on my on the team, we actually worked back when Microsoft was trying to address the use-after-free vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer that at that time, there was a lot of exploitation happening against those vulnerabilities. And we were seeing a lot of zero day vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. And what happened was Microsoft actually implemented a set of mitigations to address use after free vulnerabilities. It was called isolated heap, and at the time was called MemGC. And the purpose of this was to try to start to make use after free not exploitable anymore. And so what they did is they actually released is a mitigation in the browser without telling anybody and so we, they kind of released it silently on one of the patch Tuesdays. And what we noticed inside of the program was that all of a sudden, all of the use after free vulnerabilities that we had cataloged in our system, all were gone. And all had been basically made, made useless by this by this mitigation. And so we did a little bit of research into this. And we actually looked into how they actually implemented these mitigations. And were able to develop a set of attacks against these newly implemented mitigations. That allowed us to take advantage of them and basically allow us to bypass ASLR and break some of the mitigations that they had put into put into place. And so we quickly gathered this information together and submitted it to Microsoft \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s bounty program \u2013 and that research actually earned us $125,000 in in rewards from Microsoft, at the time being one of the one of the highest payouts that they had done as part of their bounty program. And being who we are, we actually donated all that money to education that focused on STEM education. And so that for me personally was one of my most favorite bugs and research that we\u2019ve done through the program just because of the impact that it had and also who we were able to benefit from that research.Dustin: Yeah, another bug that I go back to a lot was from Pwn2Own a couple years ago, it was a VMware bug. And to demonstrate it, they went into a virtual machine, opened a web browser and browsed to a web page, and that was the entirety of the user interaction. And from that, it escaped the browser, it escaped the kernel, it escaped the client, it executed code at system level on the underlying hypervisor. And that was incredibly impressive to watch. And just really great research to see.It\u2019s hard for me to think of a single bug just because we get so many, so I think of trends you know the rise and fall of Java bugs after you know click to run was implemented. Flash bugs that were hugely popular and have tapered off over the years. And now, you know, Flash is going away at the end of this year. The UAFS, the use after frees that Brian mentioned, those have come and gone and now we\u2019re seeing the rise of deserialization bugs. So but as far as individual ones, I look at the Pwn2Own contest. And those are those are some pretty unique bugs we see there. Even the demonstration last year with the Tesla that was really neat. You know that sort of thing. I go back to the Pwn2Own and those are the most realistic bugs that we see too. So they\u2019re fully working exploits, that you really have to spend a lot of time on to make work there. A lot of fun to watch.Brian: Yeah, truly pieces of art. I think when we look at, when we actually get to go and dig through the exploits in Pwn2Own. It is quite amazing how these researchers can not only find the zero days that they\u2019re leveraging in the contest, but then bypass all of the mitigations that have been implemented by the companies out there. It\u2019s truly inspiring and that\u2019s why a lot of these, you know, get talked about on the conference scene or when Pwnie awards at Black Hat and things like that.Lindsey: Yeah, that\u2019s very true. And I know too for Pwn2Own, that you guys have really been kind of diversifying your threat hunting services through these different events. And, you know, I feel like it\u2019s really expanded beyond, you know, browsers and OS vulnerabilities to also look at mobile and IoT devices and industrial control systems. So, you know, that\u2019s always kind of exciting to watch and look at these kind of kind of new areas that are being encompassed there.Brian:\u00a0Yeah I like the latest spins of the Pwn2Own contest where we\u2019ve partnered with the S4 conference to bring Pwn2Own to the ICS community, I think is you know, at least for this year, one of them the more impactful events that we\u2019ve run. When we first launched the contest, we were kind of unsure because we had never really ran a contest in this space before. We didn\u2019t know how the research community was going to react to this. And what we found out is, you know, when we run upon to own in a new area, people are going to start looking in those in those areas. And we had a very long, long days back at the S4 conference going through all of the exploits. I mean, we were basically there, the entire conference running exploits disclosing vulnerabilities to the different vendors, from multiple international teams. So it created quite a fun event. And I see, I think what we\u2019ve seen after that, as we\u2019ve seen a lot more disclosures in the ICS space, since that conference was run. And so you know, it does have an impact on the greater ecosystem, when programs like the Zero Day Initiative are involved in some of the more high profile events that are happening out there, and kind of encouraging people to research in certain areas, and kind of uncovering some of the new weaknesses that that exist in those.Dustin: Yeah, that\u2019s one of the great thing about the contest and about our program just in general, is that we\u2019re able to guide research and assessment areas that were looking for. Virtualization wasn\u2019t a category until 2016, for Pwn2Own. And we really wanted to see some of those virtualization bugs. Now, it\u2019s very common for us to get bugs in VMware and Oracle throughout the year. So the same thing we\u2019re seeing with ICS. We\u2019re really trying to guide researchers into areas that interest the community at large.Lindsey: Right, right. Well, you know that that sounds like it will continue to be very innovative and exciting and really what it means for the researchers and kind of what new threat areas will be expanded to. So Brian and Dustin, thank you so much for coming on today to talk about ZDI and vulnerability disclosure and Pwn2Own.Dustin:\u00a0You\u2019re welcome. Thank you for having us.Brian: Yes, we appreciate the time. Thanks.Lindsey:Thank you. And thanks again to our listeners for tuning into today\u2019s Threatpost podcast.

        "raw text": "Facebook has implemented a fresh security vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) this week \u2013 in an effort to explain how it decides when and how to roll out details on various bugs that its team finds in third-party software and open-source projects.Generally speaking, companies will have 21 days to respond when Facebook files a report; if they don\u2019t, the tech giant \u201creserves the right\u201d to disclose the bug. If a report is acknowledged, the impacted company then has 90 days (from the time the report is filed) to patch before Facebook goes public.However, there are exceptions to these guidelines. For instance, if Facebook determines that disclosing a security vulnerability sooner \u201cserves to benefit the public or the potentially impacted people,\u201d it may pull the rip cord on disclosure: For instance, if a bug is being actively exploited in the wild.Click to RegisterThe policy also says that Facebook may also disclose early if a patch is validated ready to go, but the project owner delays rollout; and conversely, if a project\u2019s release cycle necessitates a longer window, it may agree to delay disclosure beyond the initial 90-day window.\u201cOur priority is to see these issues promptly fixed, while making sure that people impacted are informed so that they can protect themselves by deploying a patch or updating their systems,\u201d the tech giant said, in its recently published VDP. \u201cHowever\u2026not all bugs are equally sensitive. A high-impact security issue requires much more care before it is publicly disclosed.\u201dAs far as the communication process, the policy dictates that Facebook will first find the appropriate contact (an open-source project-maintainer, say) \u2013 and then will contact that person appropriately (via emails, bug trackers, support tickets and so on) to provide a description of the issue found, a statement of Facebook\u2019s VDP and the expected next steps.Those next steps include the contact acknowledging the report and verifying/replicating the issue (and asking for more information if necessary) before working on a fix to be released within the 90-day window.\u201cFixing an issue requires close collaboration between researchers at Facebook reporting the issue and the third party responsible for fixing it,\u201d according to the VDP. \u201cWhenever appropriate, Facebook will work with the responsible contact to establish the nature of the issue and potential fixes. We will share relevant technical details to help expedite the fix.\u201dOn a case-by-case basis, Facebook said it would coordinate disclosure with the impacted developer, either publicly or to specific people or companies using the project, and include/issue a CVE when appropriate.The news comes as Facebook-owned WhatsApp rolls out its own changes this week. The messaging service has debuted a dedicated advisory page that provides a comprehensive list of WhatsApp security updates and associated CVEs, with descriptions aimed at helping researchers understand the impact of the bugs. WhatsApp said it will keep \u201cwith industry best practices\u201d and not disclose security issues until claims have been \u201cfully investigated,\u201d \u201cnecessary fixes\u201d issued and updates provided through respective app stores.Vulnerability disclosure is a hot topic of late, with The U.S. government\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) announcing this week a mandate for federal agencies to implement vulnerability-disclosure policies (VDPs). The move goes hand-in-hand with bug-bounty program goals; the idea is to give ethical hackers clear guidelines for submitting bugs found in government systems, to be rolled out by next March.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.Bug BountyFacebookVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The U.S. government\u2019s cybersecurity agency is now requiring federal agencies to implement vulnerability-disclosure policies (VDPs), which would give ethical hackers clear guidelines for submitting bugs found in government systems, by next March.Currently, most federal agencies lack a formal mechanism to receive information from white-hat hackers about potential security vulnerabilities on their systems. The new directive by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) aims to change this by requiring agencies to publish policies with detailed descriptions of which systems are in scope, the types of testing that are allowed and how ethical hackers can submit vulnerability reports. A directive is a compulsory direction for federal, executive branch, departments and agencies.\u201cWhen agencies integrate vulnerability reporting into their existing cybersecurity risk management activities, they can weigh and address a wider array of concerns,\u201d according to the CISA directive, released Wednesday. \u201cThis helps safeguard the information the public has entrusted to the government and gives federal cybersecurity teams more data to protect their agencies. Additionally, ensuring consistent policies across the executive branch offers those who report vulnerabilities equivalent protection and a more uniform experience.\u201dThe policies would cover all internet-accessible systems or services in government agencies \u2013 including systems that were not intentionally made internet-accessible, according to CISA.The directive mandates that organizations implement VDPs with clear wording around which systems are in-scope, as well as assurances around good-faith security research. VDPs must also clearly identify the mechanism through which researchers can report flaws to agencies, and provide \u201ctimely\u201d feedback on vulnerabilities reported.And, \u201cto streamline communication and collaboration, Federal agencies shall ensure vulnerability reports are available to system owners within 48 hours of submission, and shall establish a channel for system owners to communicate with vulnerability reporters, as appropriate,\u201d according to a memorandum sent to heads of executive departments and agencies.Today we issued a directive that requires federal civilian agencies in the executive branch to publish a #vulnerability disclosure policy. This will ensure people know how to report a problem if they find one.

Bryan Ware, assistant director of CISA, said that the agency received more than 200 recommendations from more than 40 security researchers, academics, federal agencies, technology companies, civil society and members of Congress.As next steps, in 60 days CISA will publish further guidance regarding implementation, which will break down actions that agencies should take to incorporate VDP into their information-security programs in an effective, standardized, responsible and tailored manner. And, within 180 days all agencies must publish and operationalize their VDP.Finally, in 240 days agencies must report \u201cmilestones for VDP to cover all federal information systems\u201d and CISA must begin coordinating ways to track reported bugs.As part of the directive, CISA will offer a vulnerability-disclosure program service next spring. \u201cWe expect this will ease operations at agencies, diminish their reporting burden under this directive, and enhance discoverability for vulnerability reporters,\u201d according to CISA.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.Editor's PicksGovernmentVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a new Android vulnerability that could allow malware to pose as popular apps and ask for various permissions, potentially allowing hackers to listen in on users, take photos, read and send SMS messages, and basically take over various functions as if they are the device\u2019s owner.Security researchers John H\u00f8egh-Omdal, Caner Kaya and Markus Ottensmann at Norwegian app-security provider Promon discovered the flaw\u2014which they dubbed \u201cStrandHogg\u201d from old Norse for the Viking tactic of plundering villages and holding people for ransom. They said attackers can use the vulnerability to allow \u201creal-life malware to pose as legitimate apps, with users unaware they are being targeted,\u201d according to a blog post.\u201cThe attack can be designed to request permissions which would be natural for different targeted apps to request, in turn lowering suspicion from victims,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cUsers are unaware that they are giving permission to the hacker and not the authentic app they believe they are using.\u201dIf the flaw is exploited, to users it appears that they are clicking on an app that they use every day, such as Facebook or Instagram. However, what happens when they click on the app is that instead of the app a user intended to open starting up, malware is deployed that can give permissions to the hacker, who is directed to the legitimate app, researchers said.The flaw, which can be exploited by \u201creal-life malware,\u201d affects all Android devices, including those running Android 10, they said, as well as puts the top 500 most popular apps at risk.Researchers from Promon partner Lookout already have identified 36 malicious apps exploiting the vulnerability, which can be done without gaining root access to the device, according to the post. Among those apps were variants of the BankBot Trojan\u2014widespread malware that\u2019s been detected all over the world\u2013observed as early as 2017, researchers said.Moreover, the persistent problem of malware slipping under the radar on Google Play is what appears to be responsible for the spread of malicious code that exploits the flaw, researchers said. While the specific malware sample that Promon researchers analyzed did not reside on the app store, it was installed through several dropper apps/hostile downloaders distributed on Google Play, they said.While these apps have since been removed, dropper apps continue to be published in spite of protections that exist on the store, researchers said. In fact, some are being downloaded millions of times before being spotted and deleted, they said.Indeed, Google has struggled mightily with malware making its way onto Google Play under its watch and recently has taken new steps to try to alleviate this problem. The discovery of StrandHogg appears to make the need for better security for Android mobile apps all that more urgent.Indeed, the existence of the vulnerability already being exploited in the wild certainly is troubling, as it means users already likely have been compromised and remain at critical risk, observed Sam Bakken, senior product marketing manager, for digital identity and anti-fraud solution provider OneSpan.\u201cAs you might imagine, criminals salivate over the monetization potential in stolen mobile banking credentials and access to one-time-passwords sent via SMS,\u201d he said in an e-mail to Threatpost. \u201cPromon\u2019s recent findings make the vulnerability as severe as it\u2019s ever been.\u201dThere is some good news in all of this, Bakken said. Security solutions do exist \u201cunder the umbrella of in-app protection\u201d that can protect devices from malware exploiting StrandHogg, including \u201capp shielding and runtime protection [that] make it easier for app developers to mitigate these windows of exposure resulting from security issues in both Android and iOS,\u201d he said.Free Threatpost Webinar: Risk around third-party vendors is real and can lead to data disasters.

        "raw text": "The U.S. government\u2019s cybersecurity agency has issued a draft directive mandating all agencies to develop vulnerability disclosure policies, which would give ethical hackers clear guidelines for submitting bugs found in government systems.Security experts hope that the directive will light a fire under the feet of federal agencies to create more transparency around the ins and outs of vulnerability disclosure, as well as increase trust overall between the government and security communities.The directive, which is a compulsory order for federal departments and agencies, is in a draft phase and remains open for public comment until Dec. 27, according to its issuer, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).Currently, most federal agencies lack a formal mechanism to receive information from white-hat hackers about potential security vulnerabilities on their systems, CISA said in the draft directive, released last week: \u201cMany agencies have no defined strategy for handling reports about such issues shared by outside parties. Only a few agencies have clearly stated that those who disclose vulnerabilities in good faith are authorized.\u201dThe directive would aim to change this by requiring agencies to publish policies with detailed descriptions of which systems are in scope, the types of testing that are allowed and how white hat hackers can submit vulnerability reports. The policies would cover all internet-accessible systems or services in government agencies \u2013 including systems that were not intentionally made internet-accessible, according to CISA.In addition, agencies must create a commitment to not pursue legal action against anyone acting in good faith \u2013 a common issue that has occurred in previous vulnerability disclosure and bug-bounty programs.The directive also touches on various other logistics of vulnerability disclosure reports, including its handling procedures (how reports are tracked and evaluated), as well as reporting requirements and metrics. Agencies must also create a capability to receive unsolicited reports about potential security vulnerabilities, CISA said.Security experts, such as Katie Moussouris, founder of Luta Security, are applauding the measure. Moussouris, who has worked with the U.S. government previously to flesh out bug-bounty programs like Hack the Pentagon, said that the directive has several positive points \u2013 including encouraging agencies to accept submissions from white hat hackers worldwide and banning non-disclosure rules for submitters.Good highlights of this directive:\u2013 prohibits vuln submissions for offense use\u2013 prohibits setting non-disclosure rules on submitters\u2013 encourages submission from anyone worldwide\u2013 encourages goals & metrics for response & time to fix\u2013 doesn\u2019t force a bug bounty https://t.co/uf3EiRmM9r\u2014 Katie Moussouris (@k8em0) November 28, 2019That said, Moussouris said that she worried that the quick timelines established by the directive would leave agencies struggling \u2014 Agencies would need to publish vulnerability disclosure policies within 180 days of the directive\u2019s issuance, and create a capability to receive unsolicited reports about potential security vulnerabilities within 15 days of its issuance, for instance.Moussouris also said she\u2019s concerned this might cause some agencies to rush into an outsourced third-party bug-bounty programs, without thinking through consequences such as how to keep up with submitted bugs, for instance.\u201cYes, I know it *says* this isn\u2019t to force bug bounties, but if you look at the dates for complying, the urgency language used in pushing the concept that has been documented & implemented for decades as vuln disclosure, most orgs will only have time for outsourcing to platforms,\u201d she said on Twitter.Yes, I know it *says* this isn\u2019t to force bug bounties, but if you look at the dates for complying, the urgency language used in pushing the concept that has been documented & implemented for decades as vuln disclosure, most orgs will only have time for outsourcing to platforms.\u2014 Katie Moussouris (@k8em0) November 28, 2019The draft directive comes as the U.S. government pushes for further security measures across various agencies. A government order in May for instance required agencies to remediate critical vulnerabilities discovered on their systems in 15 days \u2013 cutting in half the previous deadline of 30 days.The directive for its part would also allow agencies to operate a bug-bounty program in addition to the vulnerability disclosure policy. Vulnerability disclosure \u2013 and discussion around how it should be handled by the U.S. government\u2013 \u00a0has long been discussed, particularly with the inception of government-sponsored bug bounty programs such as the\u00a0Hack the Pentagon, Hack the DTS and Hack the Air Force.\u201cPublic vulnerability disclosure should be a basic practice for every company, not just government agencies,\u201d\u00a0Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra, told Threatpost. \u201cVulnerabilities in software are frequently discovered by the security community. If an organization doesn\u2019t provide a method for the security research community to disclose the vulnerability and a follow up process for addressing those vulnerabilities it doesn\u2019t mean they go away. Those vulnerabilities will persist until someone finds them useful and they lead to a breach.\u201d\u00a0Bug BountyGovernmentVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Big gaps exist in the 22-year-old Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) system that do not address dangerous flaws in cloud services that drive millions of apps and backend services. Too often, cloud providers needlessly expose customers to risk by not sharing the details of bugs discovered on their platform. A CVE-like approach to cloud bug management must exist to help customers weigh exposure, impact and mitigate risk.That is the opinion of a growing number of security firms pushing for a better cloud vulnerability and risk management. They argue because of CVE identification rules, which only assign CVE tracking numbers to vulnerabilities that end-users and network admin can directly manage, the current model is broken.MITRE, the non-profit organization behind the CVE system, does not designate CVE IDs for security issues deemed to be the responsibility of cloud providers. The assumption is that cloud providers own the problem, and that assigning CVEs that are not customer-controlled or patched by admins falls outside of the CVE system purview.[Editor\u2019s Note: This article was originally published in the free Threatpost eBook \u201cCloud Security: The Forecast for 2022.\u201d In it we explore organizations\u2019 top risks and challenges, best practices for defense, and advice for security success in such a dynamic computing environment, including handy checklists. Please download the FREE eBook for the full story]\u201c[It is a false] assumption that all issues can be resolved by the cloud provider and therefore do not need a tracking number,\u201d wrote Scott Piper, a cloud-security researcher with Summit Route, in a recent blog. \u201cThis view is sometimes incorrect, and even when the issue can be resolved by the cloud provider, I still believe it warrants having a record.\u201dPiper\u2019s critiques are part of his introduction to a curated list of dozens of documented instances of cloud-service provider mistakes that he says prove the point.Over the past year, for example, Amazon Web Services snuffed out a host of cross-account vulnerabilities. As well, Microsoft recently patched two nasty Azure bugs (ChaosDB and OMIGOD). And, last year, Alphabet\u2019s Google Cloud Platform tackled a number of bugs, including a policy-bypass flaw.\u201cAs we uncover new types of vulnerabilities, we discover more and more issues that do not fit the current [MITRE CVE reporting] model,\u201d wrote cloud researchers Alon Schindel and Shir Tamari with the cloud security firm Wiz, in a post. \u201cSecurity industry call to action: we need a [centralized] cloudvulnerability database.\u201dThe researchers acknowledged that cloud service providers do respond quickly to cloud bugs and work fast to mitigate issues. However, the process of identifying, tracking and helping those affected to assess risk needs streamlining.An example: When researchers found a series of cross-account AWS vulnerabilities in August, Amazon moved quickly to mitigate the problem by changing AWS defaults and updating the user set-up guides. Next, AWS emailed affected customers and urged them to update any vulnerable configurations.\u201cThe problem here is that [many] users weren\u2019t aware of the vulnerable configuration and the response actions they should take. Either the email never made it to the right person, or it got lost in a sea of other issues,\u201d Schindel and Tamari wrote.In the context of cloud, affected users should be able to easily track a vulnerability and whether it has already been addressed in their organizations, as well as what cloud resources have already been scoped and fixed, the researchers said.The CVE approach to cloud bugs also has the support of the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), which counts Google, Microsoft and Oracle as executive members.Cloud Bug CVE Approach: Shared Industry GoalsThe efforts share many of the same goals, including:Standardized notification channels to be used by all cloud service providersStandardized bug or issue trackingSeverity scoring to help prioritize mitigation effortsTransparency into the vulnerabilities and their detectionIn August, Brian Martin, on his blog Curmudgeonly Ways, pointed out that MITRE\u2019s history covering cloud vulnerabilities is mixed.\u201cAt times, some of the CVE (editorial) Board has advocated for CVEs to expand to cover cloud vulnerabilities, while others argue against it. At least one who advocated for CVE coverage said they should get CVE IDs, [with] others that supported and disagreed with the idea saying that if cloud was covered, [those bugs] should get their own ID scheme,\u201d he wrote.Martin also pointed out that even if a CVE-like system were created, the question remains: Who will run it?\u201cThe only thing worse than such a project not getting off the ground is one that does, becomes an essential part of security programs, and then goes away,\u201d he said.In July, under the auspices of CSA, the Global Security Database Working Group was chartered to go one step further than the idea of expanding CVE tracking. Its goal is to offer an alternative to CVEs and what the group called a one-size-fits-all approach to vulnerability identification. The working group believes the \u201con-demand\u201d nature and continued growth of IT infrastructures brought on by cloud migration necessitate a corresponding maturity in cybersecurity.\u201cWhat we see is a need to figure out how to create identifiers for vulnerabilities in software, services and other IT infrastructure that is proportional to the amount of technology in existence,\u201d said Jim Reavis, cofounder and chief executive officer of CSA, when introducing the working group. \u201cThe common design goal is for vulnerability identifiers to be easily discovered, fast to assign, updatable and publicly available\u201d \u2013 not just in the cloud, but across IT infrastructure.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), stated in a public news interview that the now-infamous Log4j flaw is the \u201cthe most serious vulnerability that [she has] seen in her career.\u201d It\u2019s not a stretch to say the whole security industry would agree.December of 2021 will be looked back on with a tinge of trauma and dread for incident responders, system administrators and security practitioners. You all probably already know\u2014 on December 9, a remote code execution vulnerability was uncovered in the programming library named Log4j, which is nearly ubiquitous in Java applications and software used all across the internet.It felt like this vulnerability affected, well, everything. On top of that, it was very difficult to determine what applications were vulnerable, and from what entry point.The vulnerability made headlines and news articles with details about the threat were released left and right. Vendors came out of the woodwork\u2014some explaining how they were affected, some helping the community with free resources\u2014and others to pitch their product and capitalize on chaos. While payloads and bypass techniques were shared by the offense, detection capabilities and scanning tools were shared by the defense. Keeping up with the amount of information on the Log4shell vulnerability felt like drinking from a firehose.But you already knew all that. We are even just adding to the noise with this article right here.So let\u2019s talk about something else.Where Were the Exploits?Despite the \u201csky is falling\u201d aura in the information-security community during the weeks Log4Shell was uncovered, the industry saw surprisingly few large-scale attacks compared to what we expected. This was extremely fortunate.We as defenders were flying by the seat of our pants\u2014working to gauge the attack surface, how to detect, mitigate, patch and understand what this threat truly is. As it turns out, attackers were doing the same thing, scrambling and figuring things out as they went. Both offense and defense were working to stay one step ahead of the other side.While there was less carnage and devastation than we expected, that\u2019s not to say there wasn\u2019t any. We saw our fair share of compromised VMware Horizon servers, alongside others in the industry.After exploiting Log4j for initial access, threat actors would resort to their usual work: installing persistence to maintain access, lurking and dwelling in the environment (we\u2019ve seen web-shell indicators dating back to December 23 while the industry caught wind of this around January 10), and continuing actions on objectives.For some, the goal was further post-exploitation and compromise with tooling such as Cobalt Strike. More often than not, the malicious activity we have uncovered is abusing system power and resources to mine cryptocurrency.A brief example highlights a detection caught by Windows Defender: a PowerShell command downloading and executing the code present at 80.71.158[.]96/xms.ps1 (at the time of writing, this link is still serving malware).The retrieved xm.ps1 script reads as follows:You can see it disables the firewall and executes a new binary for the XMRig miner. It creates scheduled tasks and new autorun entries for this to consistently run. Thanks to the initial access vector from the Log4j vulnerability in the VMware Horizon server, the operator runs commands under the context of the \u201cNT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\u201d user: the absolute owner and administrator of the device.Maintaining this SYSTEM-level access is done by a deployed web shell, often in the form seen below.The web shell enabled attackers to control this box remotely from anywhere in the world. Commands that were run through this web shell were still executed under the context of the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM (root-level privileges).Log4j Opened the DoorThe CVE-2021-44228 Log4j vulnerability offers initial access, which means hackers can then perform all the disruption, degradation and potential destruction they wish. Coupled with other vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, even more damage could be done.One particular recent vulnerability, the CVE-2021-4034 \u201cPwnKit\u201d bug affecting the PolKit pkexec utility, is of note. It\u2019s present on a significant number of Linux distributions, and will easily elevate any low-privilege user to root and administrator access. Weaponizing both the trivial Log4j vulnerability for initial access, as well as the trivial pkexec vulnerability for privilege escalation, could make for easy mass compromise of Linux servers if they are not patched.Needless to say, patching was, is and always will be the utmost priority. In the case of Log4j, some individuals thought that using an up-to-date version of Java (the language interpreter itself), rather than the individual Log4j library would be enough. This was quickly debunked, and the attack chain was made publicly available in the JNDI-Exploit-Kit project on GitHub.Just added support to LDAP Serialized Payloads in the JNDI-Exploit-Kit. This attack path works in *ANY* java version as long the classes used in the Serialized payload are in the application classpath. Do not rely on your java version being up-to-date and update your log4j ASAP! pic.twitter.com/z3B2UolisR\u2014 M\u00e1rcio Almeida (@marcioalm) December 13, 2021If the vulnerable Log4 library is not patched, there is still a risk, even if initial access is not possible. The syntax used to pull off the attack relies on an outbound connection, reaching out via the LDAP protocol to retrieve a Java class hosted elsewhere. In this outbound connection request, the attacker could exfiltrate sensitive information potentially stored in environment variables.Cloud-based hosted networks or other production systems might hold secrets or access tokens within these environment variables. If these secrets like AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in Amazon Web Services were to be leaked, a threat actor could then enable themselves to compromise even more.So What Now?While the cybersecurity industry moves through the beginning of 2022, the Log4j nightmare is just another incident that makes us want to say goodbye and good riddance to 2021. But it\u2019s not quite in the rearview mirror just yet.Remember when we thought that, after applying a patch or two, the previous Microsoft Exchange vulnerability ProxyLogon would disappear? But in what felt like an instant, threat actors flung ProxyShell into all of our worlds, taking many by surprise. And while ProxyShell/ProxyLogon ended up not being quite as significant as Log4shell, these vulnerabilities still prove that threat actors love to recycle and level up a good threat whenever they can.Considering just how deeply embedded the use of the Log4j package could be within applications, this vulnerability could continue to rear its head for many years to come. Much like the old Shellshock bug, some vendors or software providers might not even know the issue exists until it is discovered externally somewhere down the road.Only time will tell if Log4shell makes a fierce return and disrupts the industry again (not to mention, our holiday weekends). As we continue through this year, it\u2019s best to keep an eye on those sideview mirrors\u2014just in case.John Hammond is a senior security researcher at Huntress.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our microsite.InfoSec InsiderVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A fully working exploit for the critical CVE-2021-22005 remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerability in VMware vCenter is now public and being exploited in the wild.Released on Monday by Rapid7 security engineer William Vu (who goes by the Twitter handle wvu), this one\u2019s different from the incomplete proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit that began making the rounds on Friday. This variant can be used to open a reverse shell on a vulnerable server, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated, remote users and allows attackers to upload a file to the vCenter Server analytics service.UPDATE: Indicators of ExploitUPDATE: 092821 16:21 The attack team at the attack surface management firm Randori also has a working RCE exploit for CVE-2021-22005. Zero-day finder Aaron Portnoy detailed the exploit in his attack notes, which also include detection methods and indicators of exploit that defenders can use to determine whether or not they\u2019ve been exploited by this bug.Randori confirmed what VMware, CISA and everybody else is saying: Namely, that these vulnerabilities \u201care very serious issues,\u201d and that affected organizations \u201cshould take immediate action to ensure the security of impacted devices.\u201d As it is, Portnoy said, CISA has predicted a high likelihood that foreign actors will move quickly to exploit the vulnerability.Portnoy also reiterated what VMware has already stressed: To wit, users should just assume that\u00a0 they\u2019re already infected. \u201cOrganizations that have or had affected vCenter versions exposed to the Internet, since the vulnerability was made public on September 21, should assume that an adversary may have gained access to their network and review historical logs for anomalous behavior, such as abnormal usernames or source IP connections, and signs of compromise,\u201d he wrote.Below is Vu\u2019s unredacted RCE proof-of-concept exploit against endpoints in servers that have the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) component enabled. Through CEIP, VMware collects technical information about customers\u2019 use of its products. The CEIP is toggled on as a default setting in VMware Cloud Foundation.Unredacted RCE PoC against VMware\u2019s CEIP. Source: wvu.Not that configurations matter with this vulnerability, VMware said last week. \u201cThis vulnerability can be used by anyone who can reach vCenter Server over the network to gain access, regardless of the configuration settings of vCenter Server,\u201d said Bob Plankers, technical marketing architect at VMware, when VMware announced the vulnerability on Tuesday.CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann noted that a redacted PoC that Vu listed at the start of a thread that began on Friday didn\u2019t require CEIP to be enabled. \u201cUnclear if THAT one is being used in the wild now,\u201d Dormann said.According to Vu\u2019s technical analysis, the full, unredacted PoC starts with a request to create a directory for path traversal and schedules the spawn of a reverse shell.History of a Bad BugVMware announced CVE-2021-22005 a week ago, on Sept. 21, as part of a security update that included patches for 19 CVE-numbered vulnerabilities that affect the company\u2019s vCenter Server virtualization management platform and its hybrid Cloud Foundation platform for managing VMs and orchestrating containers.They were all serious, but CVE-2021-22005 \u2013 a critical arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Analytics service \u2013 was assigned a CVSSv3 base score of 9.8 out of a maximum severity rating of 10. VMware urged users to declare an \u201cemergency change\u201d per ITIL definitions of change types and to patch as soon as possible.Also, on Friday, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned that VMware had confirmed that threat actors were exploiting the bug and that security researchers were reporting mass scanning for vulnerable vCenter servers and publicly available exploit code. CISA urged users with vulnerable systems to prioritize updating or to apply VMware\u2019s workaround.\u201cDue to the availability of exploit code, CISA expects widespread exploitation of this vulnerability,\u201d the advisory stated.Know What Assets Need to Be PatchedIn addition to prioritizing patching, it\u2019s important to know about all the assets that need to be patched, according to Greg Fitzgerald, co-founder of the cybersecurity firm Sevco Security.\u201cWe\u2019ve found that the vast majority of enterprises have robust patch management tools that are extremely effective at what they\u2019re designed to do: Applying patches to assets that security and IT teams know about,\u201d he told Threatpost via email on Tuesday.He continued: \u201cCompanies are not getting breached because their patch management tools aren\u2019t good enough. They\u2019re getting breached because it\u2019s impossible to patch an asset you don\u2019t know is there in the first place. Maintaining an accurate IT asset inventory in a dynamic environment is really hard to do. Threat actors figured that out a long time ago and work around the clock to exploit it. The first step to combating threats like this one is to establish a continuously updated, accurate inventory of all enterprise assets to serve as a foundational control for your security program.\u201dRule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

        "raw text": "The plugin \u201cVariation Swatches for WooCommerce,\u201d installed across 80,000 WordPress-powered retail sites, contains a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) security vulnerability that could allow cyberattackers to inject malicious web scripts and take over sites.Variation Swatches is designed to allow retailers using the WooCommerce platform for WordPress sites to show different versions of the same product, like a sweater in several colors. Unfortunately, vulnerable versions can also give users without administrative permissions \u2014 like customers or subscribers \u2014 access to the plugin\u2019s settings, according to researchers from Wordfence.\u201cMore specifically, the plugin registered the \u2018tawcvs_save_settings,\u2019 \u2018update_attribute_type_setting\u2019 and \u2018update_product_attr_type\u2019 functions, which were all hooked to various AJAX actions,\u201d Wordfence\u2019s Chloe Chamberland explained, in a Wednesday posting. \u201cThese three functions were all missing capability checks as well as nonce checks, which provide cross-site request forgery protection.\u201dGiving low-permissioned users access to the \u201ctawcvs_save_settings\u201d function is particularly concerning, she said, because that access can be used to update the plugin\u2019s settings and inject malicious web scripts that would execute whenever a site owner accessed the settings area of the plugin.\u201cAs always, malicious web scripts can be crafted to inject new administrative user accounts or even modify a plugin or theme file to include a backdoor, which in turn would grant the attacker the ability to completely take over a site,\u201d the researcher added.The vulnerability (CVE-2021-42367) affected all users of the plugin until Nov. 23, when it was patched in the new 2.1.2 version.WordPress Users Plagued by ProblemsWordPress users are already grappling with cascading bugs, incidents and compromises. Last week for instance, GoDaddy, the world\u2019s largest domain registrar, was breached \u2014 affecting 1.2 million customers along with various resellers of GoDaddy Managed WordPress.In mid-Nov. another glitchy WordPress plugin let attackers display a fake ransomware encryption message demanding about $6,000 to unlock the site. The threat was empty, all the users needed to do was delete the plugin, but had the attackers deployed actual ransomware the outcome could have been catastrophic.And in late October, a WordPress plugin bug was discovered in the Hashthemes Demo Importer offering, that allowed users with simple subscriber permissions to wipe sites of all content.To mitigate this latest plugin bug, Chamberland recommends\u00a0 that users update their sites with the patched version of the Variation Swatches for WooCommerce.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.\u00a0REGISTER TODAY\u00a0to learn key concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and how to use it to navigate the data ocean and add context to cybersecurity threats (without being an expert!).

        "raw text": "Canopy, a parental control app that offers a range of features meant to protect kids online via content inspection, is vulnerable to a variety of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, according to researchers.The attacks could range from a sneaky kid disabling the monitoring to a much more serious third-party attack delivering malware to parental users.Canopy offers sexting prevention, on-device photo protection (through image filtering), screen-time monitoring, child communication alerts for parents, smart content filtering for weeding out inappropriate websites, plus, for the parents, remote device management and the ability to control the use of the applications and websites their child uses.To perform such wonders, Canopy uses an artificial intelligence engine and VPN filtering \u2013 plus a healthy number of device permissions.\u201cThe installation process involved authorizing a wide set of permissions including accessibility support, the ability to draw on top of other apps, installing a root CA and configuring a VPN,\u201d explained Craig Young, security researcher at Tripwire, in a report published on Tuesday. \u201cThe app can also (optionally) act as a device administrator to prevent app removal\u2026This privileged access can introduce considerable risk to the security of protected devices and the privacy of the children using those devices.\u201dRife with XSS IssuesIt turns out that he\u2019s not wrong to be concerned. Looking into the Android version of the app, Young discovered several opportunities to mount XSS attacks, which occur when malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites.That injection is usually carried out by entering malicious code into a web response or comment field and hitting enter, where the payload is then sent to a web server. Usually, these responses are validated on the server side so that malicious scripts are blocked. But in Canopy\u2019s case, those checks are lacking in several areas, Young found.Once a website is thus compromised, any visitor to the site is potentially a victim, either from a drive-by attack in a stored XSS scenario, or if the target can be convinced to click a link in a reflected XSS attack.Sneaky-Kid ConcernsThe first set of problems has to do with the potential for a wild child to get around the app\u2019s protective gaze.When Young tested a core Canopy function \u2013 blocking bad websites \u2013 he found that he was greeted with a block-notification page when he attempted to load a prohibited site on a test Android device. That notification page has a button allowing the child to ask his or her parents for access to the requested page anyway.Young clicked the button from the test device but appended this response with a simple XSS payload script that creates a JavaScript pop-up on the parental website, to see what would happen. When he went to the portal, sure enough, the pop-up was there.Then, he found the XSS worked in the opposite direction.\u201cI decided to deny the request and again insert an XSS payload as explanation text,\u201d Young explained. \u201cThe protected phone received a notification about the response. When I opened this notification, I was again greeted with my XSS pop-up.\u201dThe vulnerability arises because the system is failing to sanitize user inputs. The input field allows 50 characters, Young found, \u201cwhich was plenty to source an external script.\u201dHe said there are multiple ways to exploit the issue.\u201cAn attacker (e.g. the monitored kid) can embed an attack payload within an exception request. Although there may be a wide range of ways a clever kid could abuse this vulnerability, the most obvious would be to automatically approve a request,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first test was a payload to automatically click to approve the incoming request. This worked well, and I quickly got another payload working to automatically pause monitoring protection.\u201dCanopy Attacks by OutsidersWhile a variety of child-to-parent attacks could be carried out by a kid with some scripting knowledge, Young also found that more sinister offensives could be mounted.For instance, he observed that the URL value in the block-notification page query (indicating which website is being denied) is displayed on the main page of the parent dashboard.\u201cI did a quick test of adding a script tag into the URL and loaded up the parent console,\u201d he said, adding that he needed to play around with the syntax of the script for a while before getting a payload to \u201cfire.\u201d Now, \u201cthe JavaScript executed when loading the main page of the parent dashboard. We now can submit an exception request which takes control of the Canopy app when the parent simply logs in to check on the monitored devices.\u201dFurther, because the attack involves a crafted URL being blocked, it becomes possible for attacks to come from completely external third-party sources, he noted. An attacker need only to establish a likely-to-be-blocked website with that appended script in its URL and convince a child to try to access it. When the notification about the access request goes to the parent console, the parents monitoring the account would become victims of the malicious script.\u201cUnfortunately, the attack surface for this vulnerability is quite a bit more substantial than what was discussed earlier with request explanation text,\u201d Young said.But that\u2019s not all. It turns out that the Canopy API design could allow an external attacker to directly inject an XSS payload into a parent-account webpage by guessing the parent account ID. That would open the door to redirections to ads, exploits, malware and more. And most sinisterly, an attacker could hijack access to the parental control app itself, installed on the kid\u2019s phone, and pull GPS coordinates from protected devices on the account.\u201cThe account IDs are short numeric values, so it seems quite plausible that an attacker could seed the attack payload on every single parent account by simply issuing a block exception request for each ID value in sequence,\u201d Young explained.No Patches for the Worst Canopy AttacksYoung said that he reached out to Canopy by phone and by email repeatedly, with little response, thus prompting his disclosure of the issues. The only fix the developer issued was to prevent the child-led attacks, he added.\u201c[Canopy] failed to do anything to protect against the parent to child XSS or XSS through the URL of a blocked page request before becoming unresponsive,\u201d he said. \u201cCanopy needs to implement sanitization of all user-input fields but has failed to do so. After repeated attempts to work with the vendor, we are publishing this report (with some details removed) so that others can learn from it and act accordingly.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\u00a0Mobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

It\u2019s installed on more than 100,000 sites.\u201cOne feature the plugin implements is the ability to add a SEO title and description to posts, and this can be done while saving edits to a post or via a newly introduced REST-API endpoint,\u201d researchers at Wordfence said in a Monday blog post. \u201cUnfortunately, this REST-API endpoint was insecurely implemented.\u201dThe bug (CVE-2021-34641) allows any authenticated user, like a subscriber, to call the REST route with a valid nonce, and to update the SEO title and description for any post.\u201cThe permissions_callback for the endpoint only verified if the user had a valid REST-API nonce in the request,\u201d according to the posting. \u201cA valid REST-API nonce can be generated by any authenticated user using the rest-nonce WordPress core AJAX action.\u201dDepending on what an attacker updates the title and description to, it would allow a number of malicious actions, up to and including full site takeover, researchers said.\u201cThe payload could include malicious web scripts, like JavaScript, due to a lack of sanitization or escaping on the stored parameters,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThese web scripts would then execute any time a user accessed the \u2018All Posts\u2019 page.

For instance, in July six critical flaws were disclosed that affected the WordPress plugin Front File Manager versions 17.1 and 18.2, active on more than 2,000 websites.Earlier in the year, in March, The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress\u00a0was discovered\u00a0to contain a critical security vulnerability that attackers can exploit to quickly, easily and remotely take over a website. First reported as a zero-day bug, researchers said that it was being actively attacked in the wild.In February, an unpatched, stored XSS security bug was found to\u00a0potentially affect 50,000 Contact Form 7 Style plugin users.And in January,\u00a0researchers warned of two vulnerabilities\u00a0(one critical) in a WordPress plugin called Orbit Fox that could allow attackers to inject malicious code into vulnerable websites and/or take control of a website.Also that month, a plugin called PopUp Builder, used by WordPress websites for building pop-up ads for newsletter subscriptions,\u00a0was found to have a vulnerability that could be exploited by attackers to send out newsletters with custom content or to delete or import newsletter subscribers.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

A fix was available on April 25.\u201c[The bug] makes it possible for malicious attackers to, for example, steal the plugin API-key and potentially steal information about customers that made reservations, steal cookies or other sensitive data,\u201d according Ouwendijk in a technical breakdown and proof of concept of the bug posted Sunday.Leaky application programming interface (API) keys have been a popular target of hackers in dozens of attacks and been responsible for even more vendor fixes. Twitter, Imperva\u2019s Cloud Web Application Firewall and recently 30 popular mHealth apps have each grappled with insecure API key issues.Easily Exploit BugA review of the ReDi Restaurant Reservation plugin bug shows how an adversary can launch an attack simply by using a JavaScript payload \u2013 one that has fewer than 250 characters \u2013 to exploit the XSS bug.\u201cHow does this vulnerability work? The plugin provides users the functionality to book a reservation for the restaurant. A user just has to visit the reservation page,\u201d the researcher explained. Next, the attacker makes a reservation and in the \u201cComment\u201d field inputs the malicious JavaScript. Because the text and JavaScript code is not sanitized, or rendered harmless, the user comment data \u201cis processed and saved to local variables.\u201d\u201cNext, the saved variables are pushed to the database. Also note here that variables are not sanitized or validated before being pushed to the database. This means the strings we submit through the form for the variables UserName, UserPhone, UserEmail and UserComments will be saved to the database without changes,\u201d the researcher wrote.The payload is executed when a WordPress site administrator or restaurant owner views the reservations through the platform\u2019s own webpage.\u201cThis is a webpage where you can view the reservations made for a specific time period. This page isn\u2019t a WordPress webpage, but an external page that is loaded within an iframe, as can be seen in the PHP code,\u201d the researcher said.PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is scripting language used for generating dynamic content executed on a web server.\u201cThe url that is loaded within the iframe takes the url https[://]upcoming.reservationdiary[.]eu/Entry/ and appends it with the API-key that is registered in your ReDi Restaurant Reservation plugin. When visiting this url, it shows all the made reservations for a specific time period,\u201d Ouwendijk wrote.The publishers of the plugin, Catz Soft, did not reply to requests for comments.

        "raw text": "For a ransomware gang whose servers were purportedly commandeered last week, DarkSide has had a server-fueled weekend, with a reported hit on Toshiba Business.Late on Thursday night came a post to the \u201cExploit\u201d underground forum that looked, at least, to be from DarkSide. It described how the gang\u2019s blog, payment processing and denial-of-service (DoS) servers had been seized.Fast-forward three days, and it sure doesn\u2019t look like DarkSide is dead in the water. Friday\u2019s statement has reportedly been deleted. According to the security intelligence firm Flashpoint, some members of the underground forum questioned whether the post might have been a fake.Download \u201cThe Evolution of Ransomware\u201d to gain valuable insights on emerging trends amidst rapidly growing attack volumes. Click above to hone your defense intelligence!DarkSide has been in the headlines non-stop since it crippled operations at Colonial Pipeline Co. 10 days ago, spiking gas prices and sparking a rush to stockpile.The group extorted around $5 million in that incident, in return for which it sent the major fuel-supplying company a decryption tool that reportedly could barely limp through the process of unlocking files. A day before \u201cDarkSide\u201d \u2013 or whoever it was \u2013 put up the \u201clost-our-servers\u201d post, President Joe Biden said in an executive order that the U.S. plans to disrupt the ransomware network.Did DarkSide\u2019s Servers Spark Back to Life and Grab Toshiba?There\u2019s always the possibility that the lost-servers post was an exit scam or, at least, bogus in some way \u2013 a possibility backed up by recent activity. On Friday, Toshiba Tec Group \u2013 the arm of Toshiba that makes scanners, printers and other business equipment \u2013 confirmed that its European subsidiaries had been seized.Toshiba\u2019s investigation has shown that the attack has been limited to some regions in Europe but that it hasn\u2019t confirmed whether or not customer information was leaked.It looks to be another DarkSide job. According to screenshots of the extortion message provided to Reuters by Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions \u2013 a representative from Toshiba\u2019s French subsidiary \u2013 more than 740 gigabytes of information were compromised and included passports and other personal information.As far as DarkSide\u2019s payment-processing server goes, it was up and running as of last week: The group pulled in a $4.4 million extortion payment from a chemical distributor. As Bleeping Computer reported, Brenntag \u2013 a huge chemical distribution company headquartered in Germany but with over 17,000 employees worldwide at over 670 sites \u2013 suffered a ransomware attack that targeted its North America division. The threat actors reportedly claimed to have stolen 150GB of data.DarkSide initially demanded a 133.65 Bitcoin ransom \u2013 about $7.5 million \u2013 when it attacked the company earlier in May. BleepingComputer\u2019s sources told the outlet that Brenntag negotiated the extortion fee down to $4.4 million, which was paid on Tuesday, May 11. The outlet confirmed that the money went into a Bitcoin address its sources shared with it.\u201cBrenntag North America is currently working to resolve a limited information security incident,\u201d Brenntag told BleepingComputer on Thursday. \u201cAs soon as we learned of this incident, we disconnected affected systems from the network to contain the threat.\u201cIn addition, third-party cybersecurity and forensic experts were immediately engaged to help investigate. We also informed law enforcement of this incident.\u201dThe DarkSide Statement That\u2019s Since Gone *Poof*According to Flashpoint, on Thursday night, UNKN \u2013 the spokesperson for DarkSide\u2019s fellow RaaS, REvil \u2013 made a post on the top-tier Russian-language forum Exploit, quoting DarkSide\u2019s previous, now-deleted post. Translated from Russian into English, the statement read:Ever since the first version, we promised to speak honestly and openly about problems. A few hours ago, we lost access to the public part of our infrastructure, namely:Blog.Payment server.DOS servers.Now these servers are unavailable via SSH, the hosting panels are blocked. Hosting support, apart from information \u2018at the request of law enforcement agencies,\u2019 does not provide any other information.Also, a few hours after the withdrawal, funds from the payment server (ours and clients\u2019) were withdrawn to an unknown address.DarkSide, Other Gangs Banned from XSS ForumThe heat generated by the pipeline attack \u2013 an attack against critical U.S. infrastructure \u2013 has attracted all the wrong kind of attention to ransomware collectives. As a result, DarkSide\u2019s fellow RaaS player, REvil, found itself forced to introduce new restrictions on how it operates.The REvil gang on Friday announced that it\u2019s instituting pre-moderation for its partner network, and said it would ban any attempt to attack any government, public, educational or healthcare organizations. Referring to DarkSide\u2019s experience, REvil\u2019s backers said that the group was \u201cforced to introduce\u201d these \u201csignificant new restrictions,\u201d promising that affiliates that violated the new rules would be kicked out and that it would give out decryption tools for free.XSS Says No More RansomwareIt\u2019s not the only one coming up with new rules: according to Flashpoint researchers, the Russian-language cybercriminal forum XSS has also announced that it was outlawing all ransomware activities, including ransomware affiliate programs, ransomware for rent, and sale of ransomware software.That could be a big hit to the ransomware economy, given that XSS has been an important forum for advertising for affiliates. Some of the biggest ransomware players maintain an active presence on the forum, researchers noted, including Babuk, DarkSide, LockBit, Nefilim, Netwalker and REvil.A \u2018Critical Mass of Nonsense, Hype and Noise\u2019The XSS admin reportedly said that the ransomware expulsion is partially based on ideological differences between the forum and ransomware operators. The attention from high-profile incidents such as the pipeline attack is also quite unwelcome, the admin said, having resulted in a \u201ccritical mass of nonsense, hype and noise.\u201d Ransomware collectives and their accompanying attacks are generating \u201ctoo much PR,\u201d the XSS admin said, and are heightening the geopolitical and law-enforcement risks to a \u201chazard[ous] level.\u201dHazardous, as in, perhaps putting Russian President Vladimir Putin in an awkward position: The admin of XSS also claimed that when \u201cPeskov [the Press Secretary for the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin] is forced to make excuses in front of our overseas \u2018friends\u2019 \u2013 this is a bit too much,\u201d the XSS admin reportedly posted. The admin included a link to an article on the Russian news website Kommersant, entitled \u201cRussia has nothing to do with hacking attacks on a pipeline in the United States.\u201dWhat\u2019s Next for DarkSide?Stefano De Blasi, a threat researcher for Digital Shadows, said that it\u2019s not surprising to see news about DarkSide operations in spite of the criminal group\u2019s infrastructure having allegedly been taken down.\u201cA plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that DarkSide affiliates were likely encrypting several targets at the same time, and that some of those victims are only coming out in public about their attack a few days later,\u201d he commented to Threatpost on Monday. \u201cFor example, a Toshiba spokesperson has indicated that the company suffered that ransomware attack on May 4, just three days before the Colonial Pipeline one.\u201dDe Blasi said via email that it\u2019s \u201crealistically possible\u201d that while DarkSide\u2019s shutdown is part of a strategy to avoid further pressure from law-enforcement agencies, it\u2019s \u201cunlikely that DarkSide would immediately continue their operations without leaving some time to calm things down.\u201dThus, while we might well hear about more DarkSide encrypting sprees in the future, it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll avoid attacking more companies in the immediate aftermath of the Colonial Pipeline attack, he said.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "A sophisticated \u201cbrowser locker\u201d campaign is spreading via Facebook, ultimately pushing a tech-support scam. The effort is more advanced than most, because it involves exploiting a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on a popular news site, researchers said.Browser lockers are a type of redirection attack where web surfers will click on a site, only to be sent to a page warning them that their computer is infected with \u201ca virus\u201d or malware. The page then typically urges targets to call a number on the screen for \u201ctech-support help.\u201d If they fall for it, they\u2019re connected to a call center where they\u2019re asked to pay a fee to \u201cclean\u201d their machines.In a recent, widespread campaign, cyberattackers are using Facebook to distribute malicious links that ultimately redirect to a browser locker page, according to researchers. The links may be propagated through Facebook games, researchers at Malwarebytes noted in a post outlining its findings on Wednesday.\u201cThe campaign we looked at appears to exclusively use links posted on Facebook, which is fairly unusual considering that traditionally tech-support scams are spread via malvertising,\u201d said Malwarebytes researcher J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura.Facebook issues a pop-up to users, asking them to confirm the redirection \u2013 but the destination is obscured by the fact that the link is a bit.ly shortened URL, he added.Overall, the firm discovered 50 different bit.ly links being used for the scam over a three-month period, \u201csuggesting that there is regular rotation to avoid blacklisting,\u201d Segura said.XSS VulnerabilityThe bit.ly URLs redirect to a Peruvian website called RPP, which is \u201cperfectly legitimate and draws over 23 million visits a month,\u201d Segura said. He added that he reported this issue to Grupo RPP but had not heard back at the time of publication.He found that the site contains an XSS bug that allows for an open redirect. Open redirects happen when parameter values (the portion of URL after \u201c?\u201d) in an HTTP GET request allow for information that will redirect a user to a new website without any validation that the target is intended or legitimate. So, an attacker could manipulate that parameter to send a victim to a fake page, but the action would appear to be a legitimate action intended by the website.The redirection flow of the campaign. Click to enlarge. Source: Malwarebytes.\u201cThreat actors love to abuse open redirects as it gives some legitimacy to the URL they send victims,\u201d according to researchers .In this case, the threat actors are using the XSS bug to load external JavaScript code from buddhosi[.]com, a malicious domain controlled by the attackers, which substitutes code in the URL to create a redirect.\u201cThe JavaScript in turn creates the redirection to the browlock landing page by using the replace() method,\u201d according to the analysis. The replace() method searches a string for a specified value, and returns a new string where the specified values are replaced.Besides redirecting users to other sites, an attacker could exploit the XSS to rewrite the current page into anything they like, Segura noted.In any event, the final browser-locker landing page is hosted on one of around 500 \u201cdisposable\u201d and randomly named domains that use a variety of new-ish top-level domains (such as .casa; .site; .space; .club; .icu; or .bar).Browser LockerOnce the user lands on the browser-locker page, it fingerprints the user\u2019s browser to display a context-appropriate message.\u201cIt shows an animation mimicking a scan of current system files and threatens to delete the hard drive after five minutes,\u201d Segura noted. \u201cOf course this is all fake, but it\u2019s convincing enough that some people will call the toll-free number for assistance.\u201dThe phone numbers, like the pages themselves, are also voluminous. Malwarebytes found almost 40 different phone numbers, and noted that there are likely many more.In all, the chain of events is complicated and wide-ranging enough to help the threat actors avoid being shut down. The Facebook angle is also savvy, Segura said.As always, the best defense against these types of scams is simple awareness.As a starting point, \u201clinks posted onto social-media platforms should always be scrutinized as they are a commonly abused way for scammers and malware authors to redirect users onto undesirable content,\u201d he noted.FacebookVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Users of the Microsoft Outlook for Android app should update their apps to avoid a range of attacks.The bug (CVE-2019-1460) would allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on the affected systems and run scripts in the security context of the current user, according to Microsoft\u2019s advisory on the bug. XSS occurs when malicious parties inject client-side scripts into web pages, which trick the unsuspecting user\u2019s browser into thinking that the script came from a trusted source.In this case, the computing giant said that the issue exists in the way Microsoft Outlook for Android software parses specifically crafted email messages \u2013 thus, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending just such an email. Czech firm Cybersecurity Help said in a posting this week that the problem was an \u201cImproper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation\u201d problem that exists due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data.The adversary would need to be authenticated to the same network as the potential victim in order to carry out an attack, Microsoft said.A write-up by Symantec said that an attacker can exploit this issue to conduct spoofing attacks, while Cybersecurity Help added that an attacker could \u201csteal potentially sensitive information, change appearance of the web page, perform phishing and drive-by-download attacks.\u201dUsers should ensure that they have the latest version of the app, and update it manually if they haven\u2019t received an auto-update.Beyond installing that update, Symantec also noted that mitigation includes running the software as a nonprivileged user with minimal access rights.Researcher Rafael Pablos was credited with finding the bug, which Microsoft rates as \u201cimportant\u201d in severity.

        "raw text": "An unpatched vulnerability in the Rich Reviews plugin for WordPress is putting an estimated 16,000 sites in danger of stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.Sites running the plugin are vulnerable to unauthenticated plugin option updates, which can be used to deliver malware payloads; and according to Wordfence, attacks are already happening in the wild.\u201cAttackers are currently abusing this exploit chain to inject malvertising code into target websites,\u201d researchers explained in a Tuesday posting on the attack. \u201cThe malvertising code creates redirects and pop-up ads.\u201dFor background, Rich Reviews is a plugin that offers websites a simple way to collect user reviews and star ratings, to be used by search engines in the site descriptions they return in search results. Websites can let visitors review specific products, categories or the entire website.The BugThere are two core issues at the heart of the vulnerability: One is a lack of access controls for modifying the plugin\u2019s options, and the second is a subsequent lack of sanitization on the values of those options, according to Wordfence.To perform options updates, the plugin checks for the presence of the POST body parameter update; if the expected value is present, the plugin iterates through other options passed through POST and updates their values as needed.\u201cUnfortunately, this check is made every time the plugin\u2019s RichReviews class is instantiated regardless of user permissions or the current path,\u201d explained the researchers. \u201cThis means all incoming requests are capable of performing these changes.\u201dFurther, a number of the vulnerable option values are responsible for customizing text displayed by the plugin: \u201cImproper sanitization of these values allows attackers to inject JavaScript payloads which can be triggered by visitors as well as logged-in administrators,\u201d the firm explained.The payloads injected by these attackers are directly associated with a known, ongoing malvertising campaign, according to Wordfence.\u201cThis XSS payload is nearly identical to those we\u2019ve identified in this campaign before. The sourced third-party script place.js is similar to others we\u2019ve seen in this malvertising campaign as well, which could trigger popup ads and unwanted redirects,\u201d they explained.No PatchIt\u2019s not a zero-day; the plugin\u2019s developers are aware of the vulnerability, researchers said \u2013 however, so far there\u2019s no fix.The plugin\u2019s developers have released a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on an overall rewrite of this plugin for a while now, but someone out there apparently wanted us to work faster on it, and decided to exploit our plugin to get some malware out there. We\u2019re now going double-quick on it, and hope to have it back up (and newly cozy and secure) within the next two weeks.\u201dTo protect themselves, users should remove the Rich Reviews plugin from their sites for now.\u201cThe Rich Reviews plugin was removed from the WordPress repository six months ago,\u201d Wordfence researchers said. \u201cThat means that, even if the developers release a fix, customers will not be able to update until the plugin is reinstated in the repository.\u201dCrooks using WordPress plugins for malvertising is not a new situation. For instance, one campaign that has been ongoing since the beginning of the summer redirects website visitors to malware and fraud sites, using known vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins as the attack vector. They\u2019re targeting vulnerable websites with outdated WordPress plugin versions to inject malicious JavaScript into the front ends to perform the redirects, and add exploits to the repertoire on an ongoing basis, effectively widening the scope of the campaign. Also, they have begun installing persistent backdoors on compromised sites.Interested in the role of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, for both offense and defense?

        "raw text": "A just-patched stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WordPress allowed drive-by remote code-execution, according to an analysis.The bug exists in the built-in editor Gutenberg, which is found in WordPress 5.0 and above.\u00a0Zhouyuan Yang, a threat-researcher at FortiGuard Labs, said that Gutenberg fails to filter a post\u2019s JavaScript/HTML code if there\u2019s a \u201cShortcode\u201d error message.Shortcodes are essentially shortcuts that WordPress users can utilize to embed files or create objects that would normally require more complex code to accomplish. Shortcode blocks can be added to a page by clicking on the \u201cAdd Block button\u201d inside the Gutenberg editor.However, when adding certain HTML encoded characters (such as \u201c&lt;\u201d) to the Shortcode block itself and then re-opening the post, users will get an error message, according to the analysis.\u201c[Wordpress] previews [the post] by decoding the \u2018&lt;\u2019 to \u2018<\u201c,'\u201d explained Yang. \u201cThe XSS filter in this preview can be easily bypassed [by adding] the proof-of-concept [code] \u2018&gt;&lt;img src=1 onerror=prompt(1)&gt;.\u2019 [to the post].\u201dAfter that, when any website visitor views the post, the XSS code will be executed in their browser.\u201cThis allows a remote attacker with \u2018Contributor\u2019 or higher permissions to execute arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code in the browser of victims who access the compromised webpage,\u201d he wrote in a Thursday posting.Yang told Threatpost that an attacker can exploit this as long as he or she has a \u201ccontributor role\u201d on a vulnerable WordPress website. Attackers can also build their own website or first compromise a legitimate website to inject the code. After that, they need only entice victims to visit the compromised page in order to execute the malicious code.The \u201cstored XSS\u201d designation associated with this vulnerability is also troublesome as it is the \u201cmost dangerous\u201d type of XSS, according to OWASP.\u00a0A stored XSS occurs when a web application gathers input from a user and stores that input for later use, according to OWASP. If it\u2019s not correctly filtered, malicious data will appear to be part of the web site and run within the user\u2019s browser under the privileges of the web application.The National Institute of Standards and Technology assigned the vulnerability a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures rating of\u00a06.1, making it a Medium severity bug.Another WrinkleThere\u2019s another wrinkle in the vulnerability Yang found. \u201cIf the victim has high permissions, such as an administrator, the attacker could even compromise [their] web server,\u201d he said.For example, Yang has a proof-of-concept exploit, in which the attacker hosts a JavaScript file that could exploit the XSS bug to add a WordPress administrator account with the username \u201cattacker\u201d and password \u201cattacker\u201d to the targeted CMS.The attacker could do this by sending a GET request to the URL \u201c/wordpress/wp-admin/user-new.php,\u201d to extract the current \u2018nonce\u2019 value. Using this nonce value, it\u2019s then possible to construct a POST query and create a new user with an arbitrary username and password, as an administrator, Yang explained. The attacker could then modify an existing php file to a webshell (this is a WordPress built-in function) using this new account, then use the webshell to take control of the web server.FortiGuard Labs contacted WordPress about the flaw, which was patched this month with version 5.2.3. The vulnerability (identified as CVE-2019-16219) affects WordPress versions from 5.0 to 5.0.4, 5.1 and 5.1.1. Public disclosure of the bug was last week.It wasn\u2019t the only XSS flaw patched in the platform; the update also fixed XSS vulnerabilities found in post previews by contributors, in stored comments, during media uploads, in the dashboard and during URL sanitization.XSS flaws in WordPress and various plugins continue to plague the platform, the most popular content management system (CMS) in the world, with 60.4 percent of the global CMS market share. About a third of all of the websites on the internet are built using WordPress.Most recently, in July, WordPress plugin WP Statistics patched an XSS vulnerability that could allow for full website takeover; in March, WordPress issued a patch for a stored XSS vulnerability in the platform\u2019s comment system.Interested in the role of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, for both offense and defense?

        "raw text": "WordPress plugin WP Statistics has patched a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could allow for full website takeover, if the website is operating under certain non-default settings.WP Statistics gives website owners a tool to analyze site statistics, such as the number of visitors on the site, which browsers visitors are using, and more. The plugin is made by VeronaLabs and has more than 500,000 active installations.The unauthenticated stored XSS flaw exists in a feature of the plugin that allows a website to use a header to find the site visitors\u2019 IP addresses. XSS can be a serious vulnerability that can enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages, which could be viewed by other users. However, it is important to note that this vulnerability can only be exploited when the impacted website uses specific configurations that are not default \u2013 meaning that default settings are not vulnerable, said researchers with Sucuri who discovered the flaw.\u201cCertain types of information might seem safe, such as the visitor\u2019s IP address, but in reality aren\u2019t always what you expect,\u201d said Antony Garand, security vulnerability researcher at Sucuri, in a Wednesday analysis. \u201cDue to certain assumptions from the developers, it is possible for visitors to inject malicious code on administrative pages, leading to a full website takeover.\u201dVersions of the plugin before 12.6.7 are vulnerable to the unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerability; a patch has been issued in version 12.6.7 that addresses the flaw. Researchers said that they made initial contact with the developer regarding the flaw on June 26, 2019. The patch was released on July 1.IP Address AbuseThe vulnerability stems from the plugin failing to sanitize or validate users\u2019 IP address when it uses a header to identify their IP address \u2013 allowing a bad actor to potentially inject websites with malicious code.By default, websites using the plugin can easily find visitors\u2019 IP addresses; but, when websites running the plugin are utilizing a firewall, the user IP contacts that firewall before contacting the website.That means the website does not know what the original user\u2019s IP address is before it contacted the firewall; to remedy this, the firewall adds a header that contains the users\u2019 original\u00a0IP, allowing the site to identify the original user.However, due to lack of IP validation in the plugin, an attacker could abuse this function by emitting a forwarded IP.\u00a0As a result, the plugin fails to validate the IP, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code as their own IP, which will be stored and executed on administrative pages.\u201cSince the default value of the IP addresses is the header value and it isn\u2019t sanitized or validated with the\u00a0FILTER_VALIDATE_IP\u00a0method, it will be stored as-is if there are not multiple IP addresses in the header,\u201d researchers said.Specific SettingsThere are several roadblocks that an attacker must overcome to abuse this flaw.\u00a0First of all, a website is only vulnerable when the plugin uses a header to identify the IP address of the visitor. The website must also use a bypassable firewall (meaning the website must be configured to accept connections from everyone, and not only the ones forwarded by a firewall).Under these circumstances an\u00a0attacker could emit a forwarded IP:\u00a0\u201cThe common component of these two settings is the forwarded value being fully controlled by the attacker,\u201d researchers said.Researchers urged plugin users to update to the patched version: \u201cTo protect against this vulnerability, we strongly encourage users to update the plugin to version 12.6.7 as soon as possible,\u201d they said.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

According to OWASP, \u201cXSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.\u201dIn a typical case involving email, an attacker could send the target an email with a link containing malicious JavaScript.\u201cIf the victim clicks on the link, the HTTP request is initiated from the victim\u2019s browser and sent to the vulnerable web application,\u201d according to a Veracode writeup on XSS. \u201cThe malicious JavaScript is then reflected back to the victim\u2019s browser, where it is executed in the context of the victim user\u2019s session.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that Outlook for Android now parses those specially crafted email messages correctly, it added. Users should update their applications as soon as possible.Outlook bugs are not uncommon. Last year, a vulnerability (CVE-2018-0950) in Microsoft Outlook was found that would allow hackers to steal a user\u2019s Windows password just by having the target preview an email with a Rich Text Format (RTF) attachment that contained a remotely hosted OLE object.\u201cBy convincing a user to preview an RTF email message with Microsoft Outlook, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to obtain the victim\u2019s IP address, domain name, user name, host name, and password hash,\u201d according to the CERT description of the vulnerability, found by Will Dormann, a researcher with the CERT Coordination Center.\u00a0VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "For the second time this month a patch has been issued for the WordPress add-on called WP Live Chat Support Plugin. This time around it\u2019s a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.The WP Live Chat Support is a popular WordPress plugin that allows users to install a pop-up \u201cchat\u201d plugin to their websites for customer service functions. The plugin has more than 60,000 users. On May 6, a WordPress file-upload bug was also\u00a0patched in the plugin.The cross-site scripting vulnerability was first discovered April 30, and a patch was issued this past week. This vulnerability is particularly insidious because an unauthenticated attacker could seamlessly exploit it, allowing them to inject JavaScript payloads into impacted sites, said researchers with Sucuri who discovered the flaw.\u201cUnauthenticated attacks are very serious because they can be automated, making it easy for hackers to mount successful, widespread attacks against vulnerable websites,\u201d said John Castro, with Sucuri in a post this week. \u201cThe number of active installs, the ease of exploitation, and the effects of a successful attack are what makes this vulnerability particularly dangerous.\u201dThough this security bug has been fixed in the 8.0.27 release, it can be exploited by an attacker without any account in the vulnerable site. Despite that, Castro said he isn\u2019t aware of any exploit attempts using the flaw.The flaw exists due to a well-known attack vector in the plugin: An unprotected \u201cadmin-init\u201d hook. In\u00a0WordPress\u00a0theme and development, Hooks are functions that can be applied to an WordPress\u00a0 Action or a Filter.\u00a0Specifically, the \u201cadmin-init\u201d is the hook that is triggered before any other hook when a user accesses the admin area.Specifically, within the admin-init hook, the function \u201cwplc_head_basic\u201d updates the plugin settings without using proper privilege checks, said Castro.That means the hook could be called merely by visiting /wp-admin/admin-post.php or /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \u2013 meaning an unauthenticated attacker could exploit the flaw. \u00a0Once an attacker calls the endpoints, they can arbitrarily update the option\u00a0 \u201cwplc_custom_js.\u201dThe content of this option is added as a complement anywhere the live chat support tool appears, allowing bad actors to inject malicious JavaScript payloads in multiple locations of a vulnerable website.The plugin has been riddled with flaws over the past few months. Earlier in May, researchers said a patch for a previously-discovered critical arbitrary file upload flaw (CVE\u20102018\u201012426) \u2013could be bypassed in a proof-of-concept attack.Also this week, WordPress plugin Give, which allows users to setup a donation page on a website and currently has 60,000 installs, also patched a cross-site scripting flaw. The severe vulnerability allowed donors to inject arbitrary code on an administrative page.\u201c\u200b\u200bDue to the reflection point, the injection can only be seen by users with sufficient permissions to see the donors \u2014 this means that a malicious script could do a lot of damage while acting as these users,\u201d said Sucuri researchers, who also discovered that flaw.According to a Imperva\u00a0report,\u00a0almost all (98 percent) of WordPress vulnerabilities are related to plugins that extend the functionality and features of a website or a blog.Other recent vulnerabilities found in WordPress plugins, including Social Warfare,\u00a0Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer, \u00a0and\u00a0Yuzo Related Posts.Want to know more about Identity Management and navigating the shift beyond passwords?

        "raw text": "Certain types of online ads that expand, contract and pop-open aren\u2019t just annoying \u2013 they can sometimes be dangerous. The ads in question are called expandable ads, which use what is called iFrame Busters code. The ads, together with iFrame Buster code, are designed to break the limits of a browser\u2019s sandbox and offer advertisers in-your-face and highly effective ads.But, researcher Randy Westergren\u00a0found that many implementations of iFrame Busters are dangerous and the technical framework behind the ads that use them could be exploited by an attacker in a DOM-based cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Adversaries could use the vulnerability as an entry point and take control of a website and steal user data. According to the researcher, an undisclosed number of\u00a0 iFrame Buster-enhanced ads are used on top tier domains, despite efforts by the advertising industry to move away from them.\u201cThe XSS results in arbitrary JavaScript executing on the client-side in a first-party context. This means the code has access to manipulate the DOM, cookies, and other same-origin permissions,\u201d Westergren told Threatpost in an interview.An expandable ads that use iFrame Buster code are simply ads that can expand beyond the display area limits set by an iFrame. IFrame Buster is a generic term for these types of ads that have been used by dozens of online advertising firms including ones that work with Google\u2019s DoubleClick network. It\u2019s also important to note, the implementation of iFrame Buster advertising kits can differ greatly between vendors.Westergren said his research was sparked in late 2017 by a\u00a0Google blog posting\u00a0discussing XSS vulnerabilities tied to a small number of iFrame Buster ad kits used within its DoubleClick ad network. He expanded the research, finding DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in most iFrame Busters. Last week, Westergren disclosed his findings,\u00a0singling out research on iFrame Buster kits offered to publishers by Adform (iFrame Manager 1.7.48), Eyeblaster (Add in Eye), Adtech and Jivox.Contacted by Threatpost, ad firms Jivox and Adform said they ceased using the vulnerable iFrame Buster scripts. Eyeblaster and Adtech did not return Threatpost requests to comment for this article.\u201cThe Adform IT Security team became aware of the potential security exploit back in December 2017\u2026, \u201d said Julian Baring, general manager of Adform in an email interview with Threatpost. \u201cBased on the information we immediately started a technical investigation and action plan to resolve the potential issue.\u201dHe said that the vulnerability in\u00a0iFrame Manager (1.7.48) was fixed in January. Jivox said it ceased using the vulnerable iFrame Busters in February 2017.Experts contacted say it\u2019s unclear how many sites still host the iFrame Buster kits (code) and use the technique to deliver ads. Also unclear is if this vulnerability has ever been exploited in the wild.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a browser issue. It is an issue with ad agencies developing their own specific busters that have XSS weaknesses,\u201d Westergren said. \u201cSite owners are ultimately responsible for removing the affected/vulnerable iFrame Busters since they are hosted directly on their servers.\u201dAccording to those familiar with iFrame Busters, the technique to deliver these type ads was popular several years ago and has slowly fallen out of fashion as a competing SafeFrame standard\u00a0was introduced in 2014 by industry trade group Internet Advertising Bureau. There are no reported XSS issues tied to SafeFrame ads that also allow advertisers to have ads expand and contract on a web page.Originally the iFrame Buster ads were designed to bypass iFrame sandbox limitations on ads. \u00a0\u201c[Typically an] ad cannot extend display beyond its frame size, nor can it manipulate the DOM in the top-level page due to same-origin policy,\u201d Westergren said. \u201cIn order to work around this and allow a specific ad vendor to bypass SOP, vendor iFrame Busters (special HTML files) are often provided to be hosted on a publisher\u2019s domain.\u201dTechniques vary, but exploiting each framework involves attacking a consistent DOM-based XSS flaw found in each iFrame Buster implementation.DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities are unlike\u00a0traditional cross-site scripting exploits, where a payload is dropped onto a page in response to a HTTP(S) request.\u00a0DOM-based XSS attacks\u00a0modify the Document Object Model environment in the browser used by client-side script, and malicious code affects the execution client-side code contained on a site. This allows attackers to run JavaScript code that bypasses the browser\u2019s security feature called a same-origin policy (SOP).Malicious ads, served up unknowingly by third-party ad agencies, have long been a headache for publishers. In January Vox Media, publisher of SB Nation, Vox and The Verge, posted a blog explaining to readers it was waging war against disreputable ads. \u201cWe hate these malicious ads with the fire of a thousand suns and are working actively to keep them off of our sites,\u201d they wrote.PrivacyVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

This vulnerability gives unauthorized users access to restricted content, allowing them to view and add comments and content in certain restricted areas in the CMS, according to the advisory published Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the comment system must be enabled and the attacker must have permission to post comments,\u201d Drupal said.Another critical vulnerability in Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 involves a JavaScript function \u201cDrupal.checkPlain()\u201d flaw that it said could lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability under certain circumstances.\u00a0\u201cDrupal has a \u201cDrupal.checkPlain()\u201d JavaScript function which is used to escape potentially dangerous text before outputting it to HTML (as JavaScript output does not typically go through Twig autoescaping).

        "raw text": "Apple is urging macOS, iPhone and iPad users immediately to install respective updates this week that includes fixes for two zero-days under active attack. The patches are for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary code and ultimately take over devices.Patches are available for effected devices running iOS 15.6.1 and macOS Monterey 12.5.1. Patches address two flaws, which basically impact any Apple device that can run either iOS 15 or the Monterey version of its desktop OS, according to security updates released by Apple Wednesday.One of the flaws is a kernel bug (CVE-2022-32894), which is present both in iOS and macOS. According to Apple it is an \u201cout-of-bounds write issue [that] was addressed with improved bounds checking.\u201dThe vulnerability allows an application to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges, according to Apple, which, in usual vague fashion, said there is a report that it \u201cmay have been actively exploited.\u201dThe second flaw is identified as a WebKit bug (tracked as CVE-2022-32893), which is an out-of-bounds write issue that Apple addressed with improved bounds checking. The flaw allows for processing maliciously crafted web content that can lead to code execution, and also has been reported to be under active exploit, according to Apple. WebKit is the browser engine that powers Safari and all other third-party browsers that work on iOS.The discovery of both flaws, about which little more beyond Apple\u2019s disclosure are known, was credited to an anonymous researcher.One expert expressed worry that the latest Apple flaws \u201ccould effectively give attackers full access to device,\u201d they might create a Pegasus-like scenario similar to the one in which nation-state APTs barraged targets with spyware made by Israeli NSO Group by exploiting an iPhone vulnerability.\u201cFor most folks: update software by end of day,\u201d tweeted Rachel Tobac, the CEO of SocialProof Security, regarding the zero-days. \u201cIf threat model is elevated (journalist, activist, targeted by nation states, etc): update now,\u201d Tobac warned.The flaws were unveiled alongside other news from Google this week that it was patching its fifth zero-day so far this year for its Chrome browser, an arbitrary code execution bug under active attack.The news of yet more vulnerabilities from top tech vendors being barraged by threat actors demonstrates that despite the best efforts from top-tier tech companies to address perennial security issues in their software, it remains an uphill battle, noted Andrew Whaley, senior technical director at Promon, a Norwegian app security company.The flaws in iOS are especially worrying, given the ubiquity of iPhones and users\u2019 utter reliance on mobile devices for their daily lives, he said. However, the onus is not only on vendors to protect these devices but also for users to be more aware of existing threats, Whaley observed.\u201cWhile we all rely on our mobile devices, they are not invulnerable, and as users we need to maintain our guard just like we do on desktop operating systems,\u201d he said in an email to Threatpost.At the same time, developers of apps for iPhones and other mobile devices also should add an extra layer of security controls in their technology so they are less reliant on OS security for protection, given the flaws that frequently crop up, Whaley observed.\u201cOur experience shows that this is not happening enough, potentially leaving banking and other customers vulnerable,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u00a0HacksMobile SecurityNewsVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "VMware and experts alike are urging users to patch multiple products affected by a critical authentication bypass vulnerability that can allow an attacker to gain administrative access to a system as well as exploit other flaws.The bug\u2014tracked as CVE-2022-31656\u2014earned a rating of 9.8 on the CVSS and is one of a number of fixes the company made in various products in an update released on Tuesday for flaws that could easily become an exploit chain, researchers said.CVE-2022-31656 also certainly the most dangerous of these vulnerabilities, and likely will become more so as the researcher who discovered it\u2013Petrus Viet of VNG Security\u2013has promised in a tweet that a proof-of-concept exploit for the bug is \u201csoon to follow,\u201d experts said.This adds urgency to the need for organizations affected by the flaw to patch now, researchers said.\u201cGiven the prevalence of attacks targeting VMware vulnerabilities and a forthcoming proof-of-concept, organizations need to make patching CVE-2022-31656 a priority,\u201d Claire Tills,\u00a0 senior research engineer with Tenable\u2019s Security Response Team, said in an email to Threatpost. \u201cAs an authentication bypass, exploitation of this flaw opens up the possibility that attackers could create very troubling exploit chains.\u201dPotential for Attack ChainSpecifically, CVE-2022-31656 is an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation.The bug affects local domain users and requires that a remote attacker must have network access to a vulnerable user interface, according to a blog post by Tills published Tuesday. Once an attacker achieves this, he or she can use the flaw to bypass authentication and gain administrative access, she said.Moreover, the vulnerability is the gateway to exploiting other remote code execution (RCE) flaws addressed by VMWare\u2019s release this week\u2014CVE-2022-31658 and CVE-2022-31659\u2014to form an attack chain, Tills observed.CVE-2022-31658 is a JDBC injection RCE vulnerability that affect VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager and vRealize Automation that\u2019s earned an \u201cimportant\u201d score on the CVSS\u20148.0. The flaw allows a malicious actor with administrator and network access to trigger RCE.CVE-2022-31659 is an SQL injection RCE vulnerability that affects VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager and also earned a rating of 8.0 with a similar attack vector to CVE-2022-31658. Viet is credited with discovering both of these flaws.The other six bugs patched in the update include another RCE bug (CVE-2022-31665) rated as important; two privilege escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-31660 and CVE-2022-31661) rated as important; a local privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2022-31664) rated as important; a URL Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-31657) rated as moderate; and a path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2022-31662) rated as moderate.Patch Early, Patch EverythingVMware is no stranger to having to rush out patches for critical bugs found in its products, and has suffered its share of security woes due to the ubiquity of its platform across enterprise networks.In late June, for example, federal agencies warned of attackers pummeling VMware Horizon and Unified Access Gateway (UAG) servers to exploit the now-infamous Log4Shell RCE vulnerability, an easy-to-exploit flaw discovered in the Apache logging library Log4J late last year and continuously targeted on VMware and other platforms since then.Indeed, sometimes even patching has still not been enough for VMware, with attackers targeting existing flaws after the company does its due diligence to release a fix.This scenario occurred in December 2020, when the feds warned the adversaries were actively exploiting a weeks-old bug in Workspace One Access and Identity Manager products three days after the vendor patched the vulnerability.Though all signs point to the urgency of patching the latest threat to VMware\u2019s platform, it\u2019s highly likely that even if the advice is heeded, the danger will persist for the foreseeable future, observed one security professional.Though enterprises tend to initially move quickly to patch the most imminent threats to their network, they often miss other places attackers can exploit a flaw, observed Greg Fitzgerald, co-founder of Sevco Security, in an email to Threatpost. This is what leads to persistent and ongoing attacks, he said.\u201cThe most significant risk for enterprises isn\u2019t the speed at which they are applying critical patches; it comes from not applying the patches on every asset,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cThe simple fact is that most organizations fail to maintain an up-to-date and accurate IT asset inventory, and the most fastidious approach to patch management cannot ensure that all enterprise assets are accounted for.\u201dVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "A Windows 11 vulnerability, part of Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday roundup of fixes, is being exploited in the wild, prompting the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to advise patching of the elevation of privileges flaw by August 2.The recommendation is directed at federal agencies and concerns CVE-2022-22047, a vulnerability that carries a CVSS score of high (7.8) and exposes Windows Client Server Runtime Subsystem (CSRSS) used in Windows 11 (and earlier versions dating back to 7) and also Windows Server 2022 (and earlier versions 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019) to attack.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office. WATCH HERE.]The CSRSS bug is an elevation of privileges vulnerability that allows adversaries with a pre-established foothold on a targeted system to execute code as an unprivileged user. When the bug was first reported by Microsoft\u2019s own security team earlier this month it was classified as a zero-day, or a known bug with no patch. That patch was made available on Tuesday July 5.Researchers at FortiGuard Labs, a division of Fortinet, said the threat the bug poses to business is \u201cmedium\u201d. In a bulletin, researchers explain the downgraded rating because an adversary needs advanced \u201clocal\u201d or physical access to the targeted system to exploit the bug and a patch is available.That said, an attacker who has previously gained remote access to a computer system (via malware infection) could exploit the vulnerability remotely.\u201cAlthough there is no further information on exploitation released by Microsoft, it can be surmised that an unknown remote code execution allowed for an attacker to perform lateral movement and escalate privileges on machines vulnerable to CVE-2022-22047, ultimately allowing for SYSTEM privileges,\u201d FortiGuard Labs wrote.Office and Adobe Documents Entry PointsWhile the vulnerability is being actively exploited, there are no known public proof of concept exploits in the wild that can be used to help mitigate or sometimes fuel attacks, according to a report by The Record.\u201cThe vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code as SYSTEM, provided they can execute other code on the target,\u201d wrote Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) in its Patch Tuesday roundup last week.\u201cBugs of this type are typically paired with a code execution bug, usually a specially crafted Office or Adobe document, to take over a system. These attacks often rely on macros, which is why so many were disheartened to hear Microsoft\u2019s delay in blocking all Office macros by default,\u201d wrote ZDI author Dustin Childs.Microsoft recently said it would block the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros by default in some of its Office apps, however set no timeline enforce the policy.CISA added the Microsoft bug to its running list of known exploited vulnerabilities on July 7 (search \u201cCVE-2022-22047\u201d to find the entry) and recommends simply, \u201capply updates per vendor instructions\u201d.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office.

        "raw text": "Microsoft is alerting customers that its May Patch Tuesday update is causing authentications errors and failures tied to Windows Active Directory Domain Services. In a Friday update, Microsoft said it was investigating the issue.The warning comes amid shared reports of multiple services and policies failing after installing the security update. \u201cAuthentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing account or the password was incorrect.\u201d \u00a0posted an admin to a Reddit thread on the topic.According to Microsoft, the issue has been caused after installing the updates released on May 10, 2022.\u201cAfter installing updates released May 10, 2022 on your domain controllers, you might see authentication failures on the server or client for services such as Network Policy Server (NPS), Routing and Remote access Service (RRAS), Radius, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP),\u201d Microsoft reported.\u201cAn issue has been found related to how the mapping of certificates to machine accounts is being handled by the domain controller,\u201d Microsoft added.The domain controller is a server that is responsible for responding to authentication requests as well as verifying the user on a computer network, and the active directory is a type of directory service that stores the information about objects on a network and makes this information readily available for the users.Microsoft added a note that the update will not affect the client\u2019s Windows devices and non-domain controller windows servers, and will only cause issues for the server acting as a domain controller.\u201cInstallation of updates released May 10, 2022, on client Windows devices and non-domain controller Windows Servers will not cause this issue. This issue only affects installation of May 10, 2022, updates installed on servers used as domain controllers.\u201d Microsoft explains.Authentication Failure Caused by Security UpdateMicrosoft releases another document, explaining further details related to the authentication problem caused by the security update addressing the privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Windows Kerbose and its Active Directory Domain Service.The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2022-26931 in Windows Kerberos with a high severity CVSS rating of 7.5 and CVE-2022-26923 (discovered by security researcher Oliver Lyak) in Microsoft\u2019s Active Directory Domain Services. It has a CVSS score of 8.8 and is rated as high. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability if left unpatched and escalate the privilege to that of the domain admin.WorkaroundsThe Domain administrators are advised by Microsoft to manually map the certificates to a user in Active Directory until the official updates are available.\u201cDomain administrators can manually map certificates to a user in Active Directory using the altSecurityIdentities attribute of the user\u2019s Object,\u201d Microsoft added.\u201cIf the preferred mitigation will not work in your environment, please see \u2018KB5014754\u2014Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers\u2019 for other possible mitigations in the SChannel registry key section,\u201d reported by Microsoft.As per Microsoft any other mitigation method might not provide adequate security hardening.According to Microsoft, the May 2022 update is allowing all authentication attempts unless the certificate is older than the user, this is because the updates automatically set the StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement registry key, \u201cwhich changes the enforcement mode of the KDC to Disabled Mode, Compatibility Mode, or Full Enforcement Mode\u201d Microsoft explains.One Window Admin that spoke to Bleepingcomputer said that the only way they were able to get some of the users log in with the following installation of the patch was to disable the\u00a0 StrongCertificateBindingEnforcement key by settings its value to 0.By changing the REG_DWORD DataType value to 0, the admin can disable the strong certificate mapping check and can create the key from the scratch. This method is not recommended by Microsoft, but it\u2019s the only way to allow all users to log in.The issues are properly investigated by Microsoft and a proper fix should be available soon.Microsoft also recently releases the 73 new patches of May\u2019s monthly update of security fixes.Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "North Korean threat actors exploited a remote code execution (RCE) zero-day vulnerability in Google\u2019s Chrome web browser weeks before the bug was discovered and patched, according to researchers.Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered the flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-0609, on Feb. 10, reporting and patching it four days later as part of an update. Researchers said at the time that an exploit for the flaw\u2013a use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome\u2019s animation component\u2013already existed in the wild.Google TAG now revealed it believes two threat groups\u2014the activity of which has been publicly tracked as Operation Dream Job and Operation AppleJeus, respectively\u2014exploited the flaw as early as Jan. 4 in \u201ccampaigns targeting U.S. based organizations spanning news media, IT, cryptocurrency and fintech industries,\u201d according to a blog post published Thursday by Google TAG\u2019s Adam Weidemann. Other organizations and countries also may have been targeted, he said.\u201cOne of the campaigns has direct infrastructure overlap with a campaign targeting security researchers which we reported on last year,\u201d he wrote. In that campaign, hackers linked to North Korea used an elaborate social-engineering campaign to set up trusted relationships with security researchers with the ultimate goal of infecting their organizations\u2019 systems with custom backdoor malware.The two groups, though separate, used the same exploit kit in their campaigns, which signals that they may work for the same entity with a shared supply chain. However, \u201ceach operate with a different mission set and deploy different techniques,\u201d Weidemann said. It\u2019s also possible that other North Korean government-backed attackers have access to the same kit, he added.Two Campaigns, One ExploitResearchers revealed specific details about both Operation Dream Job and Operation AppleJeus in the post. The former targeted more than 250 individuals working for 10 different news media, domain registrars, web hosting providers and software vendors.\u201cThe targets received emails claiming to come from recruiters at Disney, Google and Oracle with fake potential job opportunities,\u201d Weidemann explained. \u201cThe emails contained links spoofing legitimate job-hunting websites like Indeed and ZipRecruiter.\u201dIf victims clicked on the link, they would be served a hidden browser iframe that would trigger the exploit kit, he wrote. Fake job domains owned by attackers that were used in the campaign included: disneycareers[.]net, find-dreamjob[.]com, indeedus[.]org, varietyjob[.]com, and ziprecruiters[.]org.Exploitation URLs associated with Operation Dream Job used in the campaign included: https[:]//colasprint[.]com/about/about.asp, a legitimate but compromised website; and https[:]//varietyjob[.]com/sitemap/sitemap.asp.Operation AppleJeus, the work of a separate North Korean threat group, targeted more than 85 users in cryptocurrency and fintech industries leveraging the same exploit kit.Attackers compromised at least two legitimate fintech company websites to host hidden iframes that served the exploit kit to visitors to the site, researchers revealed. Google TAG also observed fake websites\u2013already set up to distribute trojanized cryptocurrency applications\u2014that hosted malicious iframes pointing their visitors to the exploit kit, Weidemann wrote.Attacker-owned websites observed in Operation AppleJeus included one dozen sites including: blockchainnews[.]vip, financialtimes365[.]com and giantblock[.]org, according to the post.Exploit Kit Revealed (Partially)Researchers managed to recover key aspects of the functionality of the exploit kit used in both campaigns, which employed multiple stages and components to target users. Links to the exploit were placed in hidden iframes on websites that attackers either owned or had previously compromised, Weidemann wrote.\u201cThe kit initially serves some heavily obfuscated javascript used to fingerprint the target system,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis script collected all available client information such as the user-agent, resolution, etc. and then sent it back to the exploitation server.\u201dIf the data sent to the server met a set of unknown requirements, the client would be served a Chrome RCE exploit and some additional javascript. If the RCE was successful, the javascript would request the next stage referenced within the script as \u201cSBX,\u201d which is a common acronym for Sandbox Escape.Researchers were unable to recover the stages of exploit that followed the initial RCE because attackers took care to protect their exploits, deploying various safeguards, Weidemann said.Those tactics included only serving the iframe at specific times\u2013presumably when attackers knew an intended target would be visiting the site, he said. In some email campaigns, attackers also sent targets links with unique IDs that potentially were used to enforce a one-time-click policy for each link. This would allow the exploit kit to only be served once, Weidemann said.Attackers also used Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption for each stage, including the clients\u2019 responses using a session-specific key. Finally, additional stages of the exploit were only served if the previous one was successful; if not, the next stage was not served, researchers found.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Microsoft has addressed 71 security vulnerabilities in its scheduled March Patch Tuesday update \u2013 only three of which are rated critical in severity. The other 68 are all rated \u201cimportant.\u201dThree of the bugs are listed as publicly known zero-days, but none of them are listed as having been exploited in the wild (thus far).The issues affect the gamut of the computing giant\u2019s portfolio, including Microsoft Windows and Windows Components, Azure Site Recovery, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and IoT, Intune, Edge (Chromium-based), Windows HTML Platforms, Office and Office Components, Skype, .NET and Visual Studio, Windows RDP, SMB Server.Notably, the tranche also contains the first-ever patch for the Xbox gaming console.It\u2019s worth noting that the update marks the second month in a row with a surprisingly low number of critical patches; in fact, February\u2019s Patch Tuesday update didn\u2019t list any.\u201cThe number of critical-rated patches is again strangely low for this number of bugs,\u201d Trend Micro Zero-Day Initiative researcher Dustin Childs noted in an email. \u201cIt\u2019s unclear if this low percentage of bugs is just a coincidence, or if Microsoft might be evaluating the severity using different calculus than in the past.\u201dCritical-Rated Microsoft Security BugsThe three critical bugs, all of which could lead to remote code execution, are:CVE-2022-22006: HEVC Video Extensions (CVSS rating of 7.8)CVE-2022-24501: VP9 Video Extensions (CVSS rating of 7.8)CVE-2022-23277: Microsoft Exchange Server (CVSS rating of 8.8)Both video extensions bugs, in HEVC and VP9, require social engineering; an attacker would need to convince a victim to download and open a specially crafted file, which could lead to a crash, according to Microsoft\u2019s advisory.The video extensions are coding standards for video compression that Windows is able to run so that users can watch high-fidelity videos. Paul Laudanski, head of threat intelligence at Tessian, noted that the likelihood of compromise is low, thanks to the user-interaction requirement.That said, the VP9 bug is more crucial for patching, he said: \u201cVP9 is supported by modern day browsers except for Internet Explorer, so it is critical for users to ensure they are updating them. While VP9 is open and royalty free, the other file code affected, HEVC, is one that users have to purchase a license for.\u201dThe vulnerability in Exchange Server meanwhile would allow an authenticated attacker to target server accounts with the aim of executing code with elevated privileges, through a network call. Laudanski added that the vulnerability arises from the server not correctly handling objects in memory, which can lead to code execution.Here, the attacker must be authenticated. Even so, \u201cthis is also listed as low complexity with exploitation more likely, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see this bug exploited in the wild soon,\u201d Childs noted. \u201cTest and deploy this to your Exchange servers quickly.\u201dKevin Breen, director of cyber-threat research at Immersive Labs, agreed. \u201cWhile requiring authentication, this vulnerability affecting on-prem Exchange servers could potentially be used during lateral movement into a part of the environment which presents the opportunity for business email compromise or data theft from email,\u201d he said via email.Claire Tills, senior research engineer at Tenable, meanwhile told Threatpost: \u201d Given the prevalence of attacks against Microsoft Exchange flaws in the past, organizations should apply the available updates immediately.\u201dPublicly Known BugsMeanwhile, the three zero-day issues are:CVE-2022-21990 \u2013 Remote Desktop Client (CVSS rating of 8.8, allows RCE)CVE-2022-24512 \u2013 .NET and Visual Studio (CVSS rating of 6.3, allows RCE)CVE-2022-24459 \u2013 Windows Fax and Scan Service (CVSS rating of 7.8, allows elevation of privilege)The RDP client issue deserves to be treated as though it was designated critical, Childs said.\u201cThis client-side bug doesn\u2019t have the same punch as server-side-related RDP, but since it\u2019s listed as publicly known, it makes sense to treat this as a critical-rated bug,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t as severe as BlueKeep or some of the other RDP server bugs, but it definitely shouldn\u2019t be overlooked.\u201dWith regards to attack vector, a threat actor would need to lure an affected RDP client to connect to a malicious RDP server, which would allow the person to trigger code execution on the targeted client, Childs explained.Breen pointed out that the bug is one of three RCE bugs affecting RDP included in the advisory; the other two are CVE-2022-23285 (CVSS 8.8) and CVE-2022-24503 (CVSS 5.4).\u201cWith the increase in remote working driving the expansion of the attack surface presented by RDP, a trio of RCE vulnerabilities affecting this protocol should be on security teams\u2019 radar,\u201d Breen said via email. \u201c[They] are a potential concern especially as this infection vector is commonly used by ransomware actors. While exploitation is not trivial, requiring an attacker to set up bespoke infrastructure, it still presents enough of a risk to be a priority.\u201dThe second known RCE bug is much less of a concern, according to Microsoft\u2019s advisory.\u201cWhile we cannot rule out the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability, the ability to exploit this vulnerability by itself is limited,\u201d according to the company. \u201cAn attacker would need to combine this with other vulnerabilities to perform an attack.\u201dPlus, a targeted user would need to be lured to trigger a payload within the application.Microsoft offered no technical details about the third publicly known bug.Other March Vulnerabilities of InterestResearchers flagged a handful of other issues to patch quickly, including CVE-2022-24508, which exists in the Windows SMBv3 client and server, and which could lead to RCE on Windows 10 version 2004 and newer systems.\u201cAuthentication is required here, but since this affected both clients and servers, an attacker could use this for lateral movement within a network,\u201d Childs explained. \u201cThis is another one I would treat as critical and mitigate quickly.\u201dBreen again agreed, and noted that Microsoft offered additional mitigations.\u201cAnother potential component of lateral movement, remotely executable CVE-2022-24508 in Windows SMB v3, seems to be one to watch out for,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile successful exploitation requires valid credentials, Microsoft provides advice on limiting SMB traffic in lateral and external connections. While this is a strong step in providing defense in depth, blocking such connections can also have an adverse effect on other tools using these connections, something to be considered in mitigation attempts.\u201dHe also flagged three privilege-escalation vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-23286 in the Windows Cloud Files Mini Filter Driver; CVE-2022-24507 in the Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock; and CVE-2022-23299 in Windows PDEV) as ones to prioritize, since they \u201ccould form the connective tissue in any multi-stage attack, are marked as more likely to be exploited and also therefore warrant interest. Addressing these will stop a potentially limited incursion becoming more serious.\u201dAnd finally, the Xbox bug (CVE-2022-21967) exists in the Xbox Live authentication manager for Windows, and can allow elevation of privilege. It\u2019s notable for its uniqueness.\u201cThis appears to be the first security patch impacting Xbox specifically,\u201d Childs said. \u201cThere was an advisory for an inadvertently disclosed Xbox Live certificate back in 2015, but this seems to be the first security-specific update for the device itself.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Some of the world\u2019s most popular communication apps are using an open-source library riddled with newfound security holes.One thing this open-source, flawed library shares with the Apache Log4J logging library fiasco that started in December: It\u2019s ubiquitous.The library, PJSIP \u2013 an open-source multimedia communication library \u2013 is used by Asterisk. Asterisk is an enterprise-class, open-source PBX (private branch exchange) toolkit that\u2019s used in voice-over-IP (VoIP) services in a massive number of implementations.According to the Asterisk site, the software is downloaded 2M times annually and runs on 1M servers in 170 countries. Asterisk powers IP PBX systems, VoIP gateways and conference servers, and it\u2019s used by SMBs, enterprises, call centers, carriers and governments.On Monday, devops platform provider JFrog Security disclosed five memory-corruption vulnerabilities in PJSIP, which supplies an API that can be used by IP telephony applications such as VoIP phones and conference apps.An attacker who successfully triggers the vulnerabilities can flip the switch on remote code execution (RCE) in an application that uses the PJSIP library, JFrog researchers explained.Following JFrog\u2019s disclosure, PJSIP\u2019s maintainers have fixed the five CVEs, depicted below.The disclosed PJSIP security vulnerabilities. Source: JFrog Security.What Went WrongIn its technical breakdown, JFrog researchers explained that the PJSIP framework offers a library named PJSUA that supplies an API for SIP applications.\u201cThe basic PJSUA APIs are also wrapped by object-oriented APIs. PJSUA offers a rich Media Manipulation API, where we have spotted the [five] vulnerabilities,\u201d they said.Three of the flaws are stack overflow vulnerabilities that can lead to RCE and which are rated 8.1 on the CVSS severity-rating scale.The remaining two include a read out-of-bounds vulnerability and a buffer overflow weakness in the PJSUA API, both of which can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) and both of which are rated at CVSS 5.9.Vulnerable ProjectsJFrog said that projects that use the PJSIP library before version 2.12 and which pass attacker-controlled arguments to any of the following APIs are vulnerable:pjsua_player_create \u2013 filename argument must be attacker-controlledpjsua_recorder_create \u2013 filename argument must be attacker-controlledpjsua_playlist_create \u2013 file_names argument must be (partially) attacker-controlledpjsua_call_dump \u2013 buffer argument capacity must be smaller than 128 bytesJFrog recommended upgrading PJSIP to version 2.12 to address the vulnerabilities.Not the First TimePockmarks in PJSIP and other common videoconferencing architecture implementations are nothing new. In August 2018, Google Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich disclosed critical vulnerabilities in most of the common ones, including WebRTC (used by Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Facebook Messenger, Signal and others), PJSIP (which, again, is used in millions of implementations of Asterisk) and Apple\u2019s proprietary library for FaceTime.\u201cIf exploited, such vulnerabilities would have let attackers crash apps using the implementation, by merely placing a video call,\u201d noted Ronen Slavin, then head of research at Reason Cybersecurity and currently the co-founder and CTO at the source code control, detection, and response platform Cycode, back in 2019. \u201cThis would have then triggered a memory heap overflow which could allow the attacker to take over the victim\u2019s video calling account.\u201dApps such as Skype, Google Hangouts and WhatsApp \u201chave made it easy to have meaningful face-to-face interactions across between two points anywhere on the globe,\u201d he wrote.It was true then. But since, the pandemic has been gas on the fire when it comes to virtual connections: all the more reason to heed JFrog\u2019s advice and patch ASAP.030222 08:25 UPDATE: A WhatsApp representative told Threatpost that the app doesn\u2019t use the PJSIP library, contrary to original reporting.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Google on Monday issued 11 security fixes for its Chrome browser, including a high-severity zero-day bug that\u2019s actively being jumped on by attackers in the wild.In a brief update, Google described the weakness, tracked as CVE-2022-0609, as a use-after-free vulnerability in Chrome\u2019s Animation component. This kind of flaw can lead to all sorts of misery, ranging from the corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. Such flaws can also be used to escape the browser\u2019s security sandbox.\u201cGoogle is aware of reports that an exploit for CVE-2022-0609 exists in the wild,\u201d according to its security update.\nTo fix the Animation problem, along with 10 other security issues, Google released Chrome 98.0.4758.102 for Windows, Mac, and Linux, due to roll out over coming days or weeks.Chrome users can fix it straight away, though, by going into the Chrome menu > Help > About Google Chrome.Given that the zero day is under active attack, updating Chrome should be done ASAP.Chrome security updates.

        "raw text": "Oh, blessed day: Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday is a featherweight in comparison to some of its not-atypical, 10-ton security updates, with just 51 patches \u2014 none of them rated critical.For February, Microsoft\u2019s releases address CVEs in Windows and Windows Components, Azure Data Explorer, Kestrel Web Server, Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), Windows Codecs Library, Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Dynamics GP, Microsoft Office and Office Components, Windows Hyper-V Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Teams.Among these, Microsoft addressed one zero-day: CVE-2022-21989, a Windows Kernel elevation-of-privilege vulnerability. And, one of the updates is for a CVE first published in 2013.This crop is in addition to the 19 CVEs patched by Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) earlier this month, which brings the February total to 70 CVEs.Whaaa? No Critical CVEs?!Of course, it\u2019s not size that matters. But February\u2019s patch-a-palooza is light not just in number of CVEs, but also in that it comes with nary a single patch that\u2019s labeled critical.Has that ever happened?As of Monday afternoon, Dustin Childs, a researcher with Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), was scratching his head on that one.\u201cIt may have happened before, but I can\u2019t find an example of a monthly release from Microsoft that doesn\u2019t include at least one critical-rated patch,\u201d Childs wrote in ZDI\u2019s Patch Tuesday analysis. \u201cIt certainly hasn\u2019t happened in recent memory.\u201dChilds noted that this February\u2019s volume \u201cis in line with February releases from previous years, which (apart from 2020) tend to be around 50 CVEs.\u201dIt follows the big batch that Microsoft baked for its January 2022 Patch Tuesday, when it addressed a total of 97 security vulnerabilities, including nine critical CVEs \u2013 one of which is a self-propagator with a 9.8 CVSS score, and six of which were listed as publicly known zero-days.To add indigestion to overwork, the January patches immediately blew up. Since their release on Jan. 11, the updates started breaking Windows, causing spontaneous boot loops on Windows domain controller servers, breaking Hyper-V and making ReFS volume systems unavailable.\u201cUnfortunate that the Jan 11 updates have a number of serious flaws that mean they are un-deployable,\u201d lamented one Threatpost reader. \u201cThat means our servers are unpatched and vulnerable to other security risks due to other bugs, until the next set of patches come out.\u201dOf the patches released today \u2013 that awaited \u201cnext set of patches\u201d \u2014 50 are rated important and one is rated moderate in severity.No Active Exploits (Yet)Microsoft listed none of the February bugs as being under exploit, though one is listed as publicly known as the time of release. But as ZDI\u2019s Childs pointed out, the same was true of last month\u2019s release \u2013 for two days, at any rate, after which the company revised CVE-2022-21882 to indicate that \u201cMicrosoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.\u201dIf Microsoft learns otherwise, or changes its corporate mind, Childs promised that ZDI will update its analysis.As for the zero-day elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Kernel, Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, noted via email: \u201cWhile Microsoft rates the vulnerability as \u2018exploitation more likely,\u2019 the complexity to exploit the vulnerability is high, because of the added legwork required to prepare the target.\u201dHe added, \u201cThis type of vulnerability is often leveraged by an attacker once they\u2019ve already compromised the target, either through the use of a separate vulnerability or malware.\u201dFull List of CVEsAs it does, ZDI has put up the full list of CVEs released by Microsoft for this month.Childs also delved into four of the more interesting bugs. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\nCVE-2022-21984 \u2013 Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:\u00a0This patch fixes a remote code-execution bug in the Microsoft DNS server. The server is only affected if dynamic updates are enabled, but this is a relatively common configuration. If you have this setup in your environment, an attacker could completely take over your DNS and execute code with elevated privileges. Since dynamic updates aren\u2019t enabled by default, this doesn\u2019t get a critical rating. However, if your DNS servers do use dynamic updates, you should treat this bug as critical.\nCVE-2022-23280 \u2013 Microsoft Outlook for Mac Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability:\u00a0\u201cThis Outlook bug could allow images to appear in the Preview Pane automatically, even if this option is disabled. On its own, exploiting this will only expose the target\u2019s IP information. However, it\u2019s possible a second bug affecting image rendering could be paired with this bug to allow remote code execution. If you are using Outlook for Mac, you should double-check to ensure your version has been updated to an unaffected version.\u201d\nCVE-2022-21995 \u2013 Windows Hyper-V Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:\u00a0\u201cThis patch fixes a guest-to-host escape in Hyper-V server. Microsoft marks the CVSS exploit complexity as high here, stating an attacker, \u2018must prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability.\u2019 Since this is the case for most exploits, it\u2019s not clear how this vulnerability is different. If you rely on Hyper-V servers in your enterprise, it\u2019s recommended to treat this as a critical update.\u201d\nCVE-2022-22005 \u2013 Microsoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:\u00a0\u201cThis patch fixes a bug in SharePoint Server that could allow an authenticated user to execute any arbitrary .NET code on the server under the context and permissions of the service account of SharePoint Web Application. An attacker would need \u2018Manage Lists\u2019 permissions to exploit this, by default, authenticated users are able to create their own sites and, in this case, the user will be the owner of this site and will have all necessary permissions.\u201d\n\nCVE-2022-21984 \u2013 Windows DNS Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:\u00a0This patch fixes a remote code-execution bug in the Microsoft DNS server. The server is only affected if dynamic updates are enabled, but this is a relatively common configuration. If you have this setup in your environment, an attacker could completely take over your DNS and execute code with elevated privileges. Since dynamic updates aren\u2019t enabled by default, this doesn\u2019t get a critical rating.

On its own, exploiting this will only expose the target\u2019s IP information. However, it\u2019s possible a second bug affecting image rendering could be paired with this bug to allow remote code execution. If you are using Outlook for Mac, you should double-check to ensure your version has been updated to an unaffected version.\u201dCVE-2022-21995 \u2013 Windows Hyper-V Remote Code Execution Vulnerability:\u00a0\u201cThis patch fixes a guest-to-host escape in Hyper-V server. Microsoft marks the CVSS exploit complexity as high here, stating an attacker, \u2018must prepare the target environment to improve exploit reliability.\u2019 Since this is the case for most exploits, it\u2019s not clear how this vulnerability is different.

An attacker would need \u2018Manage Lists\u2019 permissions to exploit this, by default, authenticated users are able to create their own sites and, in this case, the user will be the owner of this site and will have all necessary permissions.\u201dTenable\u2019s Narang also pointed out that Microsoft also patched four elevation-of-privilege vulnerabilities in its Windows Print Spooler, including two rated \u201cexploitation more likely.\u201d\u201cOne of these two flaws, CVE-2022-21999, is credited to researchers at Sangfor, who were responsible for disclosing some of the PrintNightmare vulnerabilities last summer,\u201d Narang observed. \u201cBecause of the ubiquity of Print Spooler, vulnerabilities like this have been leveraged by ransomware groups.\u201dAlso of Note: A Dusty Old-TimerDanny Kim, principal architect at Virsec, noted that he found it interesting that Microsoft republished a CVE from 2013 to notify customers that an update to Windows 10/11 is available that addresses the original CVE.\u201cThe CVE allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a signed application without invalidating the file\u2019s original signature,\u201d he explained in an email to Threatpost on Tuesday. \u201cIn Windows, signatures are used to verify that a file has not been modified since it was released by the original vendor. With the ability to inject malicious code into \u2018verified\u2019 applications, the attacker can gain complete control over a system especially if the user who runs the application has administrative privileges.\u201d He said that the attacker can go as far as creating new user accounts with full access, allowing the attacker to login to the machine at will.Though the CVE is originally from 2013, it highlights two concerning facts, he said: \u201cPatching is a slow-moving solution, and applications need to be monitored at all times. Patching is a post-attack solution that moves too slowly to keep up with today\u2019s attacks. Applications, even verified ones, cannot just be checked when they start execution \u2013 their behavior throughout the lifetime of the application needs to be monitored and verified against expected behavior.\u201dApply Patches ASAPIn spite of the fact that there were no critical CVEs nor active exploits called out in the February Patch Tuesday release, security pros recommended, as they always do, that the patches should be applied as soon as possible.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "No, you\u2019re not seeing triple: On Friday, Apache released yet another patch \u2013 version 2.17 \u2013 for yet another flaw in the ubiquitous log4j logging library, this time for a DoS bug.Trouble comes in threes, and this is the third one for log4j. The latest bug isn\u2019t a variant of the Log4Shell remote-code execution (RCE) bug that\u2019s plagued IT teams since Dec. 10, coming under active attack worldwide within hours of its public disclosure, spawning even nastier mutations and leading to the potential for denial-of-service (DoS) in Apache\u2019s initial patch.It does have similarities, though: The new bug affects the same component as the Log4Shell bug. Both the Log4Shell, tracked as CVE-2021-44228 (criticality rating of CVSS 10.0) and the new bug, tracked as CVE-2021-45105 (CVSS score: 7.5) abuse attacker-controlled lookups in logged data.The difference: The lookups in the new bug, CVE-2021-45105, are Context Map lookups instead of the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) lookups to an LDAP server that allow attackers to execute any code that\u2019s returned in the Log4Shell vulnerability.ContextMapLookup allows applications to store data in the Log4j ThreadContext Map and then retrieve the values in the Log4j configuration: For example, an app would store the current user\u2019s login id in the ThreadContext Map with the key \u201cloginId\u201d.The weakness has to do with improper input validation and uncontrolled recursion that can lead to DoS.As explained by Guy Lederfein of the Trend Micro Research Team, \u201cthe Apache Log4j API supports variable substitution in lookups. However, a crafted variable can cause the application to crash due to uncontrolled recursive substitutions. An attacker with control over lookup commands (e.g., via the Thread Context Map) can craft a malicious lookup variable, which results in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack.\u201dThe new vulnerability affects all versions of the tool from 2.0-beta9 to 2.16, which Apache shipped last week to remediate the second flaw in the trio. That second bug was the RCE flaw CVE-2021-45046, which, in turn, stemmed from Apache\u2019s incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228, aka the Log4Shell vulnerability.Lederfein continued: \u201cWhen a nested variable is substituted by the StrSubstitutor class, it recursively calls the substitute() class. However, when the nested variable references the variable being replaced, the recursion is called with the same string. This leads to an infinite recursion and a DoS condition on the server. As an example, if the Pattern Layout contains a Context Lookup of ${ctx.apiversion}, and its assigned value is ${${ctx.apiversion}}, the variable will be recursively substituted with itself.\u201dThe vulnerability has been tested and confirmed on Log4j versions up to and including 2.16, he said.Apache has listed mitigating factors, but ZDI recommends upgrading to the latest version to ensure that the bug is completely addressed.The latest bug and Apache\u2019s new round of fixes are just the latest news in the ongoing, ever-shifting log4j situation. As exploits flood in, new vulnerabilities emerge and patches turn out to need patching, huge tech players such as SAP have been hurrying to hunt down the logging library and to release product patches.CISA Mandates Immediate PatchingOn Thursday, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency directive mandating federal civilian departments and agencies to immediately patch their internet-facing systems for the Log4j vulnerabilities by Thursday, Dec. 23.The risk presented by the library\u2019s vulnerabilities is sky-high, as multiple threat actors have jumped on the opportunities to exploit vulnerable systems. As Check Point Research (CPR) highlighted last week, real-life attacks have included a crypto-mining group that launched attacks in five countries.Last week, Microsoft reported that nation-state groups Phosphorus (Iran) and Hafnium (China), as well as unnamed APTs from North Korea and Turkey, are actively exploiting Log4Shell in targeted attacks. Hafnium is known for targeting Exchange servers with the ProxyLogon zero-days back in March, while Phosphorus \u2013 aka Charming Kitten, APT35, Ajax Security Team, NewsBeef and Newscaster \u2013 made headlines for targeting global summits and conferences in 2020.CPR said that Charming Kitten had gone after seven Israeli targets as of Wednesday.Conti Ransomware Gang Is Among the AttackersThe Conti ransomware gang is in on it too: AdvIntel researchers said last week that they\u2019re seen Conti operators going after VMware vCenter.\u201cThe current exploitation led to multiple use cases through which the Conti group tested the possibilities of utilizing the Log4j 2 exploit,\u201d the researchers said last week. \u201cThe criminals pursued targeting specific vulnerable Log4j 2 VMware vCenter [servers] for lateral movement directly from the compromised network resulting in vCenter access affecting U.S. and European victim networks from the pre-existent Cobalt Strike sessions.\u201dLast week, a ransomware attack that some suspect may be attributable to the Conti gang forced a family-run chain of restaurants, hotels and breweries, McMenamins, to shut down some operations.The bugs are also being leveraged by botnets, remote access trojans (RATs), initial access brokers, and a new ransomware strain called Khonsari. As of Monday, CPR said that it\u2019s seen more than 4.3 million attempted exploits, more than 46 percent of which were made by \u201cknown malicious groups.\u201dYet More Sleepless NightsTrend Micro\u2019s Lederfein noted that the log4j component has had quite a run in the vulnerability spotlight, having received \u201cquite a bit of attention\u201d since the Log4Shell vulnerability was revealed 10 days ago. Expect more of the same, he predicted, as \u201cit would not be a surprise to see further bugs disclosed \u2013 with or without a patch.\u201dTom Garrubba, CISO with Shared Assessments, concurred: \u201cThis vulnerability has been keeping a lot of security professionals up at night,\u201d he told Threatpost. This Javageddon has even percolated up to the C-suite, he said, with the vulnerability \u201ckeeping a lot of security professionals up at night.\u201d\u201cExecutives and board members are also gaining interest as to how this will affect them as well,\u201d he said via email. \u201cLog4j is used all throughout the Internet and [affects] multiple applications and systems with deep roots.\u201d\u201cThe best path you can take right now it\u2019s a stay alert of all patches that are coming out to address this vulnerability and put them into place immediately,\u201d Garrubba advised. \u201cSadly, it appears this is going to affect organization\u2019s continuously into the future as they identify more items that are affected by this vulnerability.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Microsoft reported a total of 55 vulnerabilities, six of which are rated critical, with the remaining 49 being rated important. The flaws are found in Microsoft Windows and Windows Components, Azure, Azure RTOS, Azure Sphere, Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based), Exchange Server, Microsoft Office and Office Components, Windows Hyper-V, Windows Defender, and Visual Studio.All in all, it\u2019s a pretty light month, according to the Zero Day Initiative\u2019s (ZDI\u2019s) Dustin Childs. \u201cHistorically speaking, 55 patches in November is a relatively low number,\u201d he commentd. \u201cEven going back to 2018 when there were only 691 CVEs fixed all year, there were more November CVEs.\u201dStill, as always, this Patch Tuesday delivers high-priority fixes, the most urgent of which being the duo that are under attack.High-Priority, Actively Exploited Pair of BugsCVE-2021-42321: Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.This is a critical remote code execution (RCE) weakness in Exchange Server caused by issues with the validation of command-let (cmdlet) arguments \u2013 i.e., lightweight commands used in the PowerShell environment. They\u2019re invoked by PowerShell runtime within the context of automation scripts that are provided at the command line or invoked programmatically by the PowerShell runtime through APIs. Microsoft said that the vulnerability, rated 8.8 in criticality, has low attack complexity.In order to exploit this flaw, an attacker would need to be authenticated, which limits some of the impact, as noted by Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable. Microsoft says they are aware of \u201climited targeted attacks\u201d using this vulnerability in the wild.Microsoft has a blog post describing the vulnerability and how it\u2019s exploited.Microsoft Exchange Server has been the subject of several notable vulnerabilities throughout 2021, including ProxyLogon and associated vulnerabilities as well as ProxyShell, Narang pointed out.Click to register for our LIVE event!\u201cThough unconfirmed, this may be similar to an Exchange Server vulnerability that was discovered at the Tianfu Cup hacking competition last month,\u201d Narang suggested.Kevin Breen, director of cyber threat research at Immersive Labs, told Threatpost on Tuesday that federal or government bodies in the United States may be bound by the recent CISA directive 22-01 that puts an emphasis on faster patching of exploits that are actively being used by attackers. \u201cThis vulnerability \u2013 along with CVE-2021-42292 \u2013 would likely fall into that category,\u201d he noted in an email on Tuesday.In spite of playing a starring role at the Tianfu Cup, this flaw was actually discovered by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC). Microsoft said that it\u2019s been actively used in attacks.CVE-2021-42292: Microsoft Excel Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability.This patch fixes a security feature bypass vulnerability \u200b\u200bin Microsoft Excel for both Windows and MacOS computers that could allow code execution when opening a specially crafted file. It too was discovered by MSTIC, which said that it\u2019s also been exploited in the wild as a zero day.According to Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) November Security Update, \u201cThis is likely due to loading code that should be behind a prompt, but for whatever reason, that prompt does not appear, thus bypassing that security feature.\u201dMicrosoft doesn\u2019t suggest what effect the vulnerability might have, but its CVSS score of 7.8 gives it a severity rating of high. Immersive Labs\u2019 Breen said that the lack of detail \u201ccan make it hard to prioritize, but anything that is being exploited in the wild should be at the very top of your list to patch.\u201dMicrosoft said that the Outlook Preview Pane isn\u2019t an attack vector for this weakness, so a target would need to open the file in order for exploitation to occur.Updates are available for Windows systems, but updates for Office for Mac aren\u2019t out yet.Breen suggested that given the lack of description and a lack of updates for a vulnerability being exploited in the wild, \u201cit may be worth telling anyone in your organization using Office for Mac to be more cautious until patches are made available.\u201dOther Bugs of NoteCVE-2021-42298: Microsoft Defender Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.Defender is designed to scan every file and run with some of the highest levels or privileges in the operating system. This means an attacker could trigger the exploit by simply sending a file \u2013 the victim wouldn\u2019t even need to open or run anything, explained Kevin Breen, director of cyber threat research at Immersive Labs.Breen told Threatpost on Tuesday that this is the reason that CVE-2021-42298 is marked as \u201cexploitation more likely.\u201d\u201cAs it\u2019s not being exploited in the wild, it should get updated without any manual intervention from administrators,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThat being said, it\u2019s definitely worth checking to make sure your Defender installations are getting their updates set correctly.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s advisory includes steps to verify that users have the latest versions installed.CVE-2021-38666: Remote Desktop Client Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.Microsoft said that in the case of a Remote Desktop connection, an attacker with control of a Remote Desktop Server could trigger an RCE on the RDP client machine when a victim connects to the attacking server with the vulnerable Remote Desktop Client.That\u2019s not the clearest description, Breen noted, but the attack vector suggests that the remote desktop client installed on all supported versions of Windows contains a vulnerability.\u201cTo exploit it, an attacker would have to create their own server and convince a user to connect to the attacker,\u201d Breen explained. \u201cThere are several ways an attacker could do this, one of which could be to send the target an RDP shortcut file, either via email or a download. If the target opens this file, which in itself is not malicious, they could be giving the attacker access to their system.\u201dBreen said in an email that in addition to patching this flaw, a sensible step would be to add detections for RDP files being shared in emails or downloads.CVE-2021-38631 & CVE-2021-41371: Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).These flaws were previously publicly disclosed by security researchers. Successful exploitation of would allow an attacker to see RDP passwords for the vulnerable system.The issue affects RDP running on Windows 7 \u2013 11 and Windows Server 2008 \u2013 2019. They\u2019re rated \u201cImportant\u201d by Microsoft. Given the interest that cybercriminals (especially ransomware initial access brokers) have in RDP, \u201cit is likely that it will be exploited at some point,\u201d said Allan Liska, senior security architect at Recorded Future.Continuous Exchange VulnerabilitiesExchange vulnerabilities have been of particular concern this year, Liska noted, pointing to both Chinese nation state actors and the cybercriminals behind the DearCry ransomware (also believed to be operating out of China) as having exploited earlier vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange (CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065).\u201cWhile Microsoft only rates the vulnerability as \u2018Important\u2019 because an attacker has to be authenticated to exploit it, Recorded Future has noted that gaining legitimate credential access to Windows systems has become trivial for both nation state and cybercriminal actors,\u201d Liska said via email. Hence, he recommended prioritizing this flaw for patching.Prioritize CVE-2021-42292, TooMicrosoft wasn\u2019t clear about which security feature is bypassed by this security feature bypass vulnerability for Microsoft Excel for both Windows and MacOS computers, which affects versions 2013 \u2013 2021. But the fact that it\u2019s being exploited in the wild \u201cis concerning,\u201d Liska said and \u201cmeans it should be prioritized for patching.\u201dMicrosoft Excel is a frequent target of both nation-state attackers and cybercriminals, he noted.110921 17:21 UPDATE: Corrected misattribution of input from Kevin Breen.Want to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

It\u2019s rated with a tip-top CVSS severity score of 10 and should be considered an emergency fix.Discourse is widely used and wildly popular, being known for topping competing forum software platforms in terms of usability. It offers features that have been popularized by social-media networks, such as infinite scrolling, live updates, drag-and-drop attachments and more.According to market-share and web-usage statistics, the top website using Discourse is sellercentral.amazon.com, which sees a flood of 30 million monthly users. Discourse is also used to run the community forum for the popular radio show Car Talk.Top websites using Discourse. Source: SimilarTech.Given Discourse\u2019s widespread use, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) on Sunday urged developers to either update to patched versions 2.7.9 or later to fix the bug or to apply the necessary workarounds.The exploit can be triggered by an attacker who sends a maliciously crafted request that can lead to RCE due to a lack of validation in subscribe_url values.Update or Apply the WorkaroundThe issue has been patched in the latest beta, stable and tests-passed versions of Discourse.For those admins who can\u2019t update to 2.7.9 or later, the workaround is to block requests that start with \u201c/webhooks/aws path\u201d at an upstream proxy.The flaw is still undergoing technical analysis, but the researcher who discovered the vulnerability has published a technical analysis about it.The details in his analysis \u2013 which he released just a day after the fix was issued \u2013 could be enough for attackers to exploit it. The researcher, \u201cjoernchen,\u201d told BleepingComputer that he reported the issue to the Discourse team immediately upon finding it on Oct. 10 and that the patch itself made it easy to figure out how an exploit would work.Although the software-as-a-service (SaaS) versions of Discourse were fixed as of Wednesday, there might still be many vulnerable deployments. A Shodan search pulled up 8,640 Discourse deployments on Monday morning.Can\u2019t Fix It If You Don\u2019t Know About ItGreg Fitzgerald, co-founder of Sevco Security, told Threatpost on Monday that this RCE vulnerability points to how tricky it\u2019s getting for organizations to assess their attack surfaces.\u201cThere is more data flowing around organizations than ever before,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThere are more solutions installed than ever before. The diversity of devices, users and applications being used by the business is more complex than ever before.\u201dIt\u2019s therefore more important than ever to get asset inventory right, he continued. \u201cAll these \u2018ever befores\u2019 have made the task of creating an accurate IT asset inventory \u2013 and therefore understanding what your real attack surface looks like \u2013 incredibly challenging for companies,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cEnterprises tend to do a really good job of patching the vulnerabilities that they know about quickly, but the real threats lurking under the surface for most organization are the IT assets they\u2019ve forgotten about, which often create an easy path to data for attackers.\u201dThreatpost has reached out to Discourse for more details and to ask whether or not the team has seen any signs that the RCE has been exploited in the wild. We\u2019ll update the story when we hear back.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Today is Microsoft\u2019s October 2021 Patch Tuesday, and it delivers fixes for four zero-day vulnerabilities, one of which is being exploited in a far-reaching espionage campaign that delivers the new MysterySnail RAT malware to Windows servers.Microsoft reported a total of 74 vulnerabilities, three of which are rated critical.MysterySnail Exploits Win32K BugSecurity researchers pointed to CVE-2021-40449, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Win32k, as standing out from the crowd of patches, given that It\u2019s been exploited in the wild as a zero-day.This summer, Kaspersky researchers discovered that the exploit was being used to elevate privileges and take over Windows servers as part of a Chinese-speaking advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign from the APT IronHusky.The exploit chain ended with a freshly discovered remote access trojan (RAT) dubbed MysterySnail being installed on compromised servers, with the goal of stealing data.Bharat Jogi, Qualsys senior manager of vulnerability and threat research, told Threatpost on Tuesday that if left unpatched, \u201cMysterySnail has the potential to collect and exfiltrate system information from compromised hosts, in addition to other malicious users having the ability to gain complete control of the affected system and launch further attacks.\u201dJay Goodman, Automox director of product marketing, told Threatpost via email that these kinds of privilege elevation attacks \u201ccan be used to access beyond what the current user context of the device would allow, enabling attackers to perform unauthorized action, delete or move data, view private information, or install malicious software.\u201dThis bug, rated Important, is found in all supported versions of Windows.Greg Wiseman, Rapid7 senior security researcher, told Threatpost that this vulnerability is \u201clikely being used alongside Remote Code Execution (RCE) and/or social engineering attacks to gain more complete control of targeted systems.\u201dSatnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, noted that elevation of privilege flaws \u201care most valuable in post-compromise scenarios once an attacker has gained access to a target system through other means, in order to execute code with elevated privileges.\u201dImmersive Labs\u2019 Kevin Breen, director of cyber threat research, said that this all points to prioritizing this patch, particularly given how common these vulnerabilities are in ransomware attack chains: \u201cGaining this level of access on a compromised host is the first step towards becoming a domain admin \u2013 and securing full access to a network,\u201d he told Threastpost. \u201cAlmost every ransomware attack reported this year has included the use of one or more privilege escalation vulnerabilities as part of the attacker\u2019s workflow, so this is serious stuff indeed.\u201dA PrintNightmare Fix to Fix the Other PrintNightmare FixOther fixes released in the October Patch Tuesday batch include those that address what was a summer\u2019s full of Print Spooler-related patches. There\u2019s been a steady stream of these patches for flaws in Windows Print Spooler following June\u2019s disclosure of the PrintNightmare vulnerability \u2013 a bug that allowed threat actors to conduct remote code execution (RCE) and to gain local system privileges.This month\u2019s release includes a fix for CVE-2021-36970, a spoofing vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Windows Print Spooler that has a CVSSv3 score of 8.8.Chris Morgan, senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows, said that the spoofing vulnerability fix Microsoft put out today is meant to fix the problems that previous patches have introduced.\u201cWhile Microsoft provided a fix in their September 2021 update, the patch resulted in a number of management problems,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cCertain printers required users to repeatedly input their administrator credentials every time an application attempted to print or had a client connect to a print server.\u201cOther problems included event logs recording error messages and denying users the ability to perform basic prints\u201d he continued. \u201cAs a result, many may have likely skipped the update due to its operational impact, ultimately leaving the risk posed by PrintNightmare in place.\u201dThis vulnerability was discovered by researchers XueFeng Li and Zhiniang Peng of Sangfor, who were also credited with the discovery of CVE-2021-1675, one of two vulnerabilities known as PrintNightmare.Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable noted that \u201cWhile no details have been shared publicly about the flaw, this is definitely one to watch for, as we saw a constant stream of Print Spooler-related vulnerabilities patched over the summer while ransomware groups began incorporating PrintNightmare into their affiliate playbook. We strongly encourage organizations to apply these patches as soon as possible.\u201dRCE Affects Microsoft Word, Office, SharePointAnother vulnerability worth noting is CVE-2021-40486, a critical RCE affecting Microsoft Word, Microsoft Office and some versions of SharePoint Server that can be exploited via the Preview Pane.Gina Geisel, Automox product and partner marketing professional, noted that this vulnerability isn\u2019t new to Microsoft, with several other similar CVEs documented this year. In this case, the RCE vulnerability exists in some Microsoft apps when they fail to properly handle objects in memory.With a low attack complexity, this vulnerability requires a user opening a specially crafted file either by email or via a website, either hosted by the attacker or through a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content.\u201cAn attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can use this file to perform actions in the context of the current user,\u201d Geisel explained. \u201cFor example, the file could take actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current user.\u201dMicrosoft SharePoint Server RCEImmersive Labs\u2019 Breen told Threatpost that this RCE vulnerability \u2013 tracked as CVE-2021-40487 rated as 8.1 out of 10 CVSS score and marked as \u201cexploitation more likely\u201d \u2013 will be more difficult for an attacker to exploit, given that it requires an authenticated user on the domain.But gaining RCE on a SharePoint server \u201copens up a lot of avenues for further exploitation,\u201d he noted via email.\u201cInternal SharePoint servers are often used to host company-sensitive documents and provide an intranet for staff to interact with,\u201d Breen explained. \u201cIf an attacker could manipulate the content of these articles or replace valid documents with malicious ones, they could steal credentials or trick targeted users into installing additional malware.\u201dHighest CVSS Award Goes to Microsoft Exchange Server RCECVE-2021-26427, the latest in Exchange Server RCEs, takes the severity cake this month, with a CVSS score of 9.0 out of 10. In spite of this hgh severity rating, Microsoft has marked it as being \u201cexploitation less likely,\u201d perhaps due to the what Breen called the \u201cnetwork adjacent vector.\u201dIn other words, he explained, \u201can attacker would already need access to your network in order to exploit this vulnerability. Email servers will always be prime targets, simply due to the amount of data contained in emails and the range of possible ways attackers could use them for malicious purposes.\u201dWhile it\u2019s not \u201cright at the top\u201d of Breen\u2019s list of priorities to patch, \u201cit\u2019s certainly one to be wary of.\u201dRapid7\u2019s Wiseman concurs: This is a notable vulnerability, though it\u2019s mitigated \u201cby the fact that attacks are limited to a \u2018logically adjacent topology,'\u201d meaning, in other words, that it can\u2019t be exploited directly over the public Internet.Windows Hyper-VWiseman called on virtualization administrators to take heed of two RCEs affecting Windows Hyper-V: CVE-2021-40461 and CVE-2021-38672, both of which affect relatively new versions of Windows and which are considered critical.Windows Hyper-V is a native hypervisor that can create and run virtual machines (VMs) on x86-64 systems running Windows. These two flaws both allow a VM to escape from guest to host by triggering a memory allocation error, allowing it to read kernel memory in the host.Christopher Hass, Autmox director of information security and research, said that exploitation of these bugs \u201ccould allow a malicious guest VM to read kernel memory in the host.\u201dNeither vulnerability has been exploited publicly, and exploitation is less likely, however organizations using Hyper-V should patch these vulnerabilities as soon as possible, Hass recommended.One Step Away From Domain AdminThere\u2019s one bug that swings above its weight range: the DNS server remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability that\u2019s tracked as CVE-2021-40469.Jake Williams, Co-Founder and CTO at BreachQuest,\u00a0calls this one \u201cinteresting,\u201d as in, that curse about living in interesting times.Its base score severity rating is 7.2, but its attack complexity is low, and an attack can be launched remotely. Exploitation does, however, require what VulDB calls \u201can enhanced level of successful authentication.\u201dEven if that makes it tough to weaponize, this bug is still potentially uber nasty, given that, for one thing, it\u2019s been publicly disclosed in a proof of concept, and also that DNS servers sit in such a crucial spot.\u201cWhile it will likely be difficult to weaponize, DNS servers are typically run on domain controllers, making this extremely serious,\u201d Williams noted. \u201cA threat actor that gains remote code execution on a domain controller is likely to gain immediate domain administrator permissions. In the best case scenario, they are a mere step away from taking domain administrator.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time that Microsoft has had to stomp on an RCE vulnerability in DNS server this year, including in March\u2019s Patch Tuesday updates. This time around, the vulnerability affects various versions of Windows 7, 8.1 and 10, as well as Windows Server.Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege FlawCVE-2021-41335, an elevation of privilege vulnerability that exists when the Windows kernel fails to properly handle objects in memory, is rated high severity, and it\u2019s been publicly disclosed in a proof-of-concept (POC) showing how successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.Exploitation would enable an attacker to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application to take control of the system.Justin Knapp, Automox senior product marketing manager, explained that \u201cElevation of privilege vulnerabilities like this are often an important step in the cyber kill chain and should be immediately prioritized and patched.\u201dWindows AppContainer Firewall Rules Security Feature BypassTracked as CVE-2021-41338, this vulnerability is, again, high severity \u2013 it allows an attacker to bypass the security rules of Windows AppContainer Firewall \u2013 as well as publicly disclosed.AppContainers are designed to protect against infiltration from third-party apps. They essentially isolate the runtime environment of applications with the goal of blocking malicious code.This vulnerability results in loss of confidentiality and can be exploited without any user interaction.Maarten Buis, Automox product marketing manager, noted that a successful attacker that exploits this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on the endpoint, but they need to have administrative privileges before they can meaningfully exploit it.\u201cHowever, there is still a significant risk because no user interaction is required, and no special endpoint conditions are required for an attack to succeed,\u201d Buis explained to Threatpost via email .There are no reports of the vulnerability having been actively exploited \u2013 yet. Still, Automox recommends a rapid patch rollout \u2013 as in, within 72 hours of the patch being made available \u2013 given that it\u2019s been publicly disclosed in a proof of concept by James Forshaw of Google\u2019s Project Zero.Aleks Haugom, Automox product marketing manager, noted that, given the sheer number of apps users download, \u201cmaking sure that AppContianers cannot be compromised is important to every company\u2019s security hygiene.\u201dHow to Prioritize?Williams said that he doesn\u2019t want to sound like a broken record, but he\u2019s still going to say what security experts say every Patch Tuesday. To wit, \u201cPatch now.\u201dThat\u2019s particularly true for the MysterySnail campaign, he said: \u201cSeriously, this is not a patch Tuesday to delay on,\u201d he advised. \u201cThreat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerability for CVE-2021-40449 to elevate from user to administrator permissions on compromised systems. While CVE-2021-40449 doesn\u2019t allow for remote exploitation, that doesn\u2019t mean it can be taken lightly. Threat actors regularly gain access to target machines using phishing attacks and vulnerabilities such as CVE-2021-40449 allow them to evade more effectively bypass endpoint controls and evade detection.\u201dBesides which, MysterySnail\u2019s success in weaponizing this flaw means that other APTs will soon follow, Williams said: \u201cBecause the code for this has already been weaponized by one threat actor, we should expect to see it weaponized by others more quickly because there is already sample exploit code in the wild to work with.\u201dDanny Kim, Principle Architect at Virsec, who spent time at Microsoft during his graduate work on the OS security development team, voted for prioritizing the three critical remote code execution vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-40469, CVE-2021-26427 and CVE-2021-40487, which affect a wide range of Windows versions.\u201cThese vulnerabilities not only have a high to critical CVSS rating, but two of the three attacks (CVE-2021-40487, CVE-2021-40469) can be executed remotely,\u201d he stressed. \u201cRemote Code Execution (RCE) attacks are especially devastating because once the exploit is executed, [the attackers] can launch any kind of cyberattack, including ransomware.He noted that RCE vulnerabilities were also the root cause of the Hafnium and Kaseya attacks. \u201cTrying to mitigate the attacker\u2019s actions after they have gained access is significantly harder than stopping the actions that led to the successful exploit,\u201d Kim pointed out. \u201cThis is why runtime monitoring of enterprises\u2019 server workloads is becoming a key part of today\u2019s cybersecurity. Stopping the exploitation of these vulnerabilities has to start with equipping the servers themselves with constant, deterministic runtime protection, not just detection.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.HacksMalwareNewsVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Apple on Monday rushed out a security update for iOS 15.0.2 and iPadOS 15.0.2 to fix a remote code-execution (RCE) zero-day vulnerability that\u2019s being actively exploited.Within hours, a security researcher had picked the bug apart and published both proof-of-concept code and an explanation of the vulnerability, meaning that now\u2019s a really good time to update your iOS device.A week and a half ago, Apple released iOS 15.0.1 to fix a slew of performance glitches, but iOS 15.0.2 is the first security update for the new OS.Monday\u2019s patch addresses a memory-corruption zero day \u2013 tracked as CVE-2021-30883 \u2013 in IOMobileFrameBuffer, which is a kernel extension that acts as a screen framebuffer, allowing developers to control how the memory in a device uses the screen display.\u201cAn application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited,\u201d the company said.Attackers who get access to kernel privileges gain full control of an iOS device.Apple typically doesn\u2019t choose to hand weapons to attackers. True to form, the company kept potential attack blueprints close to its vest: It didn\u2019t release technical details for either the vulnerability nor the attack(s) that have exploited it.Not all are as cautious. Shortly after the patch was released, a security researcher named Saar Amar published both a\u00a0technical explanation and proof-of-concept exploit code. He said that he thought that the bug is \u201chighly interesting because it\u2019s accessible from the app sandbox (so it\u2019s great for jailbreaks)\u201dJailbreaking \u2013 exploiting flaws in a locked-down device in order to install software other than what the manufacturer had in mind or makes available \u2013 gives a device owner the ability to gain full access to the root of the operating system and to access all the features.A \u2018Great\u2019 BugBesides being \u201cgreat\u201d for jailbreaks, the researcher also said that the vulnerability is \u201ca good candidate for [local privilege escalation, or LPE] exploits in chains (WebContent, etc.).\u201d\u201cTherefore, I decided to take a quick look, bindiff the patch, and identify the root cause of the bug,\u201d the researcher explained. They were referring to BinDiff, a comparison tool for binary files that helps to quickly find differences and similarities in disassembled code. It\u2019s used by security researchers and engineers to identify and isolate fixes for vulnerabilities in vendor-supplied patches and to analyze multiple versions of the same binary.\u201cAfter bindiffing and reversing, I saw that the bug is great, and I decided to write this short blogpost, which I hope you\u2019ll find helpful,\u201d the security researcher wrote. \u201cI really want to publish my bindiff findings as close to the patch release as possible, so there will be no full exploit here; However, I did manage to build a really nice and stable POC that results in a great panic at the end,\u201d they said, adding a smiley.Monday\u2019s zero-day is a kissing cousin to a critical memory-corruption flaw that Apple patched in July. That bug, CVE-2021-30807, was also actively exploited, also found in the IOMobileFrameBuffer extension in both iOS and macOS, and likewise used to take over systems.Monday\u2019s update, iOS 15.0.2, is available for iPhone 6s and later, iPad Pro (all models), iPad Air 2 and later, iPad 5th generation and later, iPad mini 4 and later, and iPod touch (7th generation).Apple credited an anonymous researcher with the find.The fix comes just weeks after Apple\u2019s September release of iOS 15, replete with its much-ballyhooed new security defenses. Specifically, the new operating system comes with a built-in two-factor authentication (2FA) code generator, on-device speech recognition, and multiple anti-tracking security and privacy features. The speech recognition is meant to skirt the privacy concerns that have arisen around iPhone biometrics being sent off to the cloud to be processed (and sometimes eavesdropped on by humans).iOS 15 also included patches for at least 22 security vulnerabilities, including some that exposed iPhone and iPad users to remote denial-of-service (DoS) and remote execution of arbitrary code with kernel privileges.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Mobile SecurityVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Two legacy IBM System x server models, retired in 2019, are open to attack and will not receive security patches, according to hardware maker Lenovo. However, the company is offering workaround mitigation.The two models, IBM System x 3550 M3 and IBM System x 3650 M3, are both vulnerable to command injection attacks. The bug allows an adversary to execute arbitrary commands on either server model\u2019s operating system via a vulnerable application called Integrated Management Module (IMM).IMM is used for systems-management functions. On the back panel of System x models, serial and Ethernet connectors use the IMM for device management. The flaw, according to a Lenovo advisory posted Tuesday, is in the IMM firmware code and \u201ccould allow the execution of operating system commands over an authenticated SSH or Telnet session.\u201dSSH or Secure Shell is a cryptographic network communication protocol allowing two computers to communicate or share data. Telnet is another network protocol that allows remote users to log into another computer on the same network. Telnet, by default, does not encrypt data sent over its connection.The bug, tracked as CVE-2021-3723, was disclosed on Wednesday and bug hunter Denver Abrey is credited for finding it.Eight vulnerabilities in a later version of IMM \u2013 called IMM2 \u2013 were identified in June 2020, three high-severity. These bugs were tied to flaws in client-side code responsible for implementing the SSH2 protocol, called libssh2.Both the System x 3550 M3 and System x 3650 M3 were introduced April 5, 2011 (PDF) as midsized businesses solutions. On June 30, 2015, Lenovo announced systems were both discontinued, but would receive security updates for five additional years.According to the Lenovo security bulletin, software and security support for System x 3550 and 3650 ended December 31, 2019.\u201cLenovo has historically provided service and support for at least five years following a product\u2019s withdrawal from marketing. This is subject to change at Lenovo\u2019s sole discretion without notice. Lenovo will announce a product\u2019s EOS date at least 90 days before the actual EOS date and in most cases longer,\u201d wrote Lenovo.On Wednesday Lenovo said it \u201crecommends discontinuation of use\u201d of both servers, but offered a \u201cmitigation strategy\u201d.\u201cIf it is not feasible to discontinue use of these systems,\u201d Lenovo recommended:Disable SSH and Telnet (This can be done in the\u00a0Security\u00a0and\u00a0Network Protocol\u00a0sections of the navigation pane after logging into the IMM web interface)Change the default Administrator password during initial configurationEnforce strong passwordsOnly grant access to trusted administratorsLenovo did not indicate if it was aware of any active campaigns targeting the vulnerability.It\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

        "raw text": "Microsoft has patched 51 security vulnerabilities in its scheduled August Patch Tuesday update, including seven critical bugs, two issues that were publicly disclosed but unpatched until now, and one that\u2019s listed as a zero-day that has been exploited in the wild.Of note, there are 17 elevation-of-privilege (EoP) vulnerabilities, 13 remote code-execution (RCE) issues, eight information-disclosure flaws and two denial-of-service (DoS) bugs.The update also includes patches for three more Print Spooler bugs, familiar from the PrintNightmare saga.\u201cFortunately, it was a lighter month than usual,\u201d said Eric Feldman, senior product marketing manager at Automox, in a Patch Tuesday analysis from the vendor. \u201cThis represents a 56 percent reduction in overall vulnerabilities from July, and 33 percent fewer vulnerabilities on average for each month so far this year. We have also seen a similar reduction in critical vulnerabilities this month, with 30 percent less compared to the monthly average.\u201dWindows Critical Security VulnerabilitiesThe seven critical bugs addressed in August are as follows:CVE-2021-26424 \u2013 Windows TCP/IP RCE VulnerabilityCVE-2021-26432 \u2013 Windows Services for NFS ONCRPC XDR Driver RCE VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34480 \u2013 Scripting Engine Memory Corruption VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34530 \u2013 Windows Graphics Component RCE VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34534 \u2013 Windows MSHTML Platform RCE VulnerabilityCVE-2021-34535 \u2013 Remote Desktop Client RCE VulnerabilityCVE-2021-36936 \u2013 Windows Print Spooler RCE VulnerabilityThe bug tracked as CVE-2021-26424 exists in the TCP/IP protocol stack identified in Windows 7 and newer Microsoft operating systems, including servers.\u201cDespite its CVSS rating of 9.9, this may prove to be a trivial bug, but it\u2019s still fascinating,\u201d said Dustin Childs of Trend Micro\u2019s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) in his Tuesday analysis. \u201cAn attacker on a guest Hyper-V OS could execute code on the host Hyper-V server by sending a specially crafted IPv6 ping. This keeps it out of the wormable category. Still, a successful attack would allow the guest OS to completely take over the Hyper-V host. While not wormable, it\u2019s still cool to see new bugs in new scenarios being found in protocols that have been around for years.\u201dThe next bug, CVE-2021-26432 in Windows Services, is more likely to be exploited given its low complexity status, according to Microsoft\u2019s advisory; it doesn\u2019t require privileges or user interaction to exploit, but Microsoft offered no further details.\u201cThis may fall into the \u2018wormable\u2019 category, at least between servers with NFS installed, especially since the open network computing remote procedure call (ONCRPC) consists of an External Data Representation (XDR) runtime built on the Winsock Kernel (WSK) interface,\u201d Childs said. \u201cThat certainly sounds like elevated code on a listening network service. Don\u2019t ignore this patch.\u201dAleks Haugom, product marketing manager at Automox, added, \u201cExploitation results in total loss of confidentiality across all devices managed by the same security authority. Furthermore, attackers can utilize it for denial-of-service attacks or to maliciously modify files. So far, no further details have been divulged by Microsoft or the security researcher (Liubenjin from Codesafe Team of Legendsec at Qi\u2019anxin Group) that discovered this vulnerability. Given the broad potential impact, its label \u2018Exploitation More Likely\u2019 and apparent secrecy, patching should be completed ASAP.\u201dMeanwhile, the memory-corruption bug (CVE-2021-34480) arises from how the scripting engine handles objects in memory, and it also allows RCE. Using a web-based attack or a malicious file, such as a malicious landing page or phishing email, attackers can use this vulnerability to take control of an affected system, install programs, view or change data, or create new user accounts with full user rights.\u201cCVE-2021-34480 should also be a priority,\u201d Kevin Breen, director of cyber-threat research at Immersive Labs, told Threatpost. \u201cIt is a low score in terms of CVSS, coming in at 6.8, but has been marked by Microsoft as \u2018Exploitation More Likely\u2019 because it is the type of attack commonly used to increase the success rate of spear phishing attacks to gain network access.\u00a0 Simple, but effective.\u201dThe Windows Graphic Component bug (CVE-2021-34530) allows attackers to remotely execute malicious code in the context of the current user, according to Microsoft \u2013 if they can social-engineer a target into opening a specially crafted file.Another bug exists in the Windows MSHTML platform, also known as Trident (CVE-2021-34534). Trident is the rendering engine (mshtml.dll) used by Internet Explorer. The bug affects many Windows 10 versions (1607, 1809,1909, 2004, 20H2, 21H1) as well as Windows Server 2016 and 2019.But while it potentially affects a large number of users, exploitation is not trivial.\u201cTo exploit, a threat actor would need to pull off a highly complex attack with user interaction \u2013 still entirely possible with the sophisticated attackers of today,\u201d said Peter Pflaster, technical product marketing manager at Automox.The bug tracked as CVE-2021-34535 impacts the Microsoft Remote Desktop Client, Microsoft\u2019s nearly ubiquitous utility for connecting to remote PCs.\u201cWith today\u2019s highly dispersed workforce, CVE-2021-34535, an RCE vulnerability in Remote Desktop Clients, should be a priority patch,\u201d said Breen. \u201cAttackers increasingly use RDP access as the tip of the spear to gain network access, often combining it with privilege escalation to move laterally.\u00a0 These can be powerful as, depending on the method, it may allow the attacker to authenticate in the network in the same way a user would, making detection difficult.\u201dIt\u2019s not as dangerous of a bug as BlueKeep,\u00a0according to Childs, which also affected RDP.\u201cBefore you start having flashbacks to BlueKeep, this bug affects the RDP client and not the RDP server,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the CVSS 9.9 bug is nothing to ignore. An attacker can take over a system if they can convince an affected RDP client to connect to an RDP server they control. On Hyper-V servers, a malicious program running in a guest VM could trigger guest-to-host RCE by exploiting this vulnerability in the Hyper-V Viewer. This is the more likely scenario and the reason you should test and deploy this patch quickly.\u201dWindows Print Spooler Bugs \u2013 AgainThe final critical bug is CVE-2021-36936, a Windows Print Spooler RCE bug that\u2019s listed as publicly known.Print Spooler made headlines last month, when Microsoft patched what it thought was a minor elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the service (CVE-2021-1675). But the listing was updated later in the week, after researchers from Tencent and NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab figured out it could be used for RCE \u2013 requiring a new patch.It also disclosed a second bug, similar to PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527); and a third, an EoP issue (CVE-2021-34481).\u201cAnother month, another remote code-execution bug in the Print Spooler,\u201d said ZDI\u2019s Childs. \u201cThis bug is listed as publicly known, but it\u2019s not clear if this bug is a variant of PrintNightmare or a unique vulnerability all on its own. There are quite a few print-spooler bugs to keep track of. Either way, attackers can use this to execute code on affected systems. Microsoft does state low privileges are required, so that should put this in the non-wormable category, but you should still prioritize testing and deployment of this critical-rated bug.\u201dThe critical vulnerability is just one of three Print Spooler issues in the August Patch Tuesday release.\u201cThe specter of the PrintNightmare continues to haunt this patch Tuesday with three more print spooler vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-36947, CVE-2021-36936 and CVE-2021-34481,\u201d said Breen. \u201cAll three are listed as RCE over the network, requiring a low level of access, similar to PrintNightmare. Microsoft has marked these as \u2018Exploitation More Likely\u2019 which, if the previous speed of POC code being published is anything to go by, is certainly true.\u201dRCE Zero-Day in Windows Update Medic Service The actively exploited bug is tracked as CVE-2021-36948 and is rated as important; it could pave the way for RCE via the Windows Update Medic Service in Windows 10 and Server 2019 and newer operating systems.\u201cUpdate Medic is a new service that allows users to repair Windows Update components from a damaged state such that the device can continue to receive updates,\u201d Automox\u2019 Jay Goodman explained. \u201cThe exploit is both low complexity and can be exploited without user interaction, making this an easy vulnerability to include in an adversary\u2019s toolbox.\u201dImmersive\u2019s Breen added, \u201cCVE-2021-36948 is a privilege-escalation vulnerability \u2013 the cornerstone of modern intrusions as they allow attackers the level of access to do things like hide their tracks and create user accounts.\u00a0 In the case of ransomware attacks, they have also been used to ensure maximum damage.\u201dThough the bug is being reported as being exploited in the wild by Microsoft, activity appears to remain limited or targeted: \u201cWe have seen no evidence of it at Kenna Security at this time,\u201d Jerry Gamblin, director of security research at Kenna Security (now part of Cisco) told Threatpost.Publicly Known Windows LSA Spoofing BugThe second publicly known bug (after the Print Spooler issue covered earlier) is tracked as CVE-2021-36942, and it\u2019s an important-rated Windows LSA (Local Security Authority) spoofing vulnerability.\u201cIt fixes a flaw that could be used to steal NTLM hashes from a domain controller or other vulnerable host,\u201d Immersive\u2019s Breen said. \u201cThese types of attacks are well known for lateral movement and privilege escalation, as has been demonstrated recently by a new exploit called PetitPotam. It is a post-intrusion exploit \u2013 further down the attack chain \u2013 but still a useful tool for attackers.\u201dChilds offered a bit of context around the bug.\u201cMicrosoft released this patch to further protect against NTLM relay attacks by issuing this update to block the LSARPC interface,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will impact some systems, notably Windows Server 2008 SP2, that use the EFS API OpenEncryptedFileRawA function. You should apply this to your Domain Controllers first and follow the additional guidance in ADV210003 and KB5005413. This has been an ongoing issue since 2009, and, likely, this isn\u2019t the last we\u2019ll hear of this persistent issue.\u201dMicrosoft\u2019s next Patch Tuesday will fall on September 14.Worried about where the next attack is coming from? We\u2019ve got your back.

        "raw text": "Microsoft has released an emergency patch for the PrintNightmare, a set of two critical remote code-execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler service that hackers can use to take over an infected system. However, more fixes are necessary before all Windows systems affected by the bug are completely protected, according to the federal government.Microsoft on Tuesday released an out-of-band update for several versions of Windows to address CVE-2021-34527, the second of two bugs that were initially thought to be one flaw and which have been dubbed PrintNightmare by security researchers.However, the latest fix only appears to address the RCE variants of PrintNightmare, and not the local privilege escalation (LPE) variant, according to an advisory by the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Administration (CISA), citing a VulNote published by the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC).\u00a0Moreover, the updates do not include Windows 10 version 1607, Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2016, which will be patched at a later date, according to CERT/CC.A Tale of Two VulnerabilitiesThe PrintNightmare saga began last Tuesday when a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit for the vulnerability \u2014 at that time tracked as CVE-2021-1675 \u2014 was dropped on GitHub showing how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to take control of an affected system. While it was taken back down within a few hours, the code was copied and remains in circulation on the platform.The response to the situation soon turned into confusion. Though Microsoft released an patch for CVE-2021-1675 in it its usual raft of monthly Patch Tuesday updates, addressing what it thought was a minor EoP vulnerability, the listing was updated later in the week after researchers from Tencent and NSFOCUS TIANJI Lab figured out it could be used for RCE.However, it soon became clear to many experts that Microsoft\u2019s initial patch didn\u2019t fix the entire problem. CERT/CC on Thursday offered its own workaround for PrintNightmare, advising system administrators to disable the Windows Print Spooler service in Domain Controllers and systems that do not print.To further complicate matters, Microsoft also last Thursday dropped a notice for a bug called \u201cWindows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\u201d that appeared to be the same vulnerability, but with a different CVE number\u2014in this case, CVE-2021-34527.\u201cThis vulnerability is similar but distinct from the vulnerability that is assigned CVE-2021-1675, which addresses a different vulnerability in RpcAddPrinterDriverEx(),\u201d the company wrote in the advisory at the time. \u201cThe attack vector is different as well. CVE-2021-1675 was addressed by the June 2021 security update.\u201dMicrosoft Issues Incomplete PatchThe fix released this week addresses CVE-2021-34527, and includes protections for CVE-2021-1675, according to the CISA, which is encouraging users and administrators to review the Microsoft Security Updates as well as CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU #383432 and apply the necessary updates or workarounds.But as noted, it won\u2019t fix all systems.So, in cases where a system is not protected by the patch, Microsoft is offering several workarounds for PrintNightmare. One is very similar to the federal government\u2019s solution from last week: To stop and disable the Print Spooler service \u2014 and thus the ability to print both locally and remotely \u2014 by using the following PowerShell commands: Stop-Service -Name Spooler -Force and Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled.The second workaround is to disable inbound remote printing through Group Policy by disabling the \u201cAllow Print Spooler to accept client connections\u201d policy to block remote attacks, and then restarting the system. In this case, the system will no longer function as a print server, but local printing to a directly attached device will still be possible.Another potential option to prevent remote exploitation of the bug that has worked in \u201climited testing\u201d is to block both the RPC Endpoint Mapper (135/tcp) and SMB (139/tcp and 445/tcp) at the firewall level, according to CERT/CC. However, \u201cblocking these ports on a Windows system may prevent expected capabilities from functioning properly, especially on a system that functions as a server,\u201d the center advised.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "UPDATEAn October patch for a critical remote code execution (RCE) bug in a SonicWall VPN appliance turned out to be insufficient. While the patch closed the RCE attack vector,\u00a0 more than 800,000 devices were still vulnerable to an additional memory-leak flaw for months, according to researchers.SonicWall originally patched the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SonicWall Network Security Appliance (NSA), tracked as CVE-2020-5135, back in October.However, Craig Young, a computer security researcher with Tripwire\u2019s Vulnerability and Exposures Research Team (VERT), said the initial patch for the vulnerability was \u201cbotched,\u201d needing a \u201cone- or two-line fix\u201d to be complete, he wrote in a report published Tuesday, which details the specifics of where the fix went wrong.The vulnerability (CVE-2021-20019), not addressed by the initial October patch, is described in a security bulletin published Tuesday as, \u201cA vulnerability in SonicOS where the HTTP server response leaks partial memory by sending a crafted unauthenticated HTTP request. This can potentially lead to an internal sensitive data disclosure vulnerability.\u201dIn a statement from SonicWall sent to Threatpost it stated:\u201cSonicWall is active in collaborating with third-party researchers, security vendors and forensic analysis firms to ensure its products meet or exceed expected security standards. Through the course of this practice, SonicWall was made aware of, verified, tested and patched a non-critical buffer overflow vulnerability that impacted versions of SonicOS. SonicWall is not aware of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild. As always, SonicWall strongly encourages organizations maintain patch diligence for all security products.\u201d The initial bug, with a CVSS severity rating of 9.4. The vulnerability highlighted by Tripwire has a medium CVSS severity rating of 5.3.Though SonicWall was aware of the problem soon after the fix was released, it only released a complete patch this week, Young wrote.\u201cI had expected that a patch would probably come out quickly but, fast-forward to March and I still had not heard back,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI reconnected with their PSIRT [Product Security Incident Response Team] on March 1, 2021, for an update, but ultimately it took until well into June before an advisory could be released.\u201dWhere It Went WrongYoung and Nikita Abramov, application analysis specialist at Positive Technologies (PT), were credited back in October with finding the flaw, which exists within the HTTP/HTTPS service used for product management and SSL VPN remote access.The vulnerability could allow an unskilled attacker to trigger a persistent denial-of-service (DoS) condition using an unauthenticated HTTP request involving a custom protocol handler, as well as spread further damage, Young wrote in his analysis at the time.Abramov and Young both reported the bug to SonicWall around the same time in late September, and the company gave Young a date of Oct. 5 for a patch to resolve the problem. That date later was pushed up to Oct. 14, he said, which is when SonicWall also acknowledged to Threatpost that it had indeed issued a patch for the flaw.However, after the patch was released, Young tested a SonicWall VPN on Microsoft Azure to confirm how it responded to a proof-of-concept exploit he\u2019d devised for the flaw and found that it was still vulnerable. However, though it did not crash the system, the exploit payload did trigger a flood of binary data in response, he wrote, providing a screenshot of the result in his analysis.\u201cAs you can see from the screenshot, there are values in the binary data which certainly look like they could be memory addresses,\u201d Young wrote. \u201cAlthough I never observed recognizable text in the leaked memory, I believe this output could vary based on how the target system is used. I also suspect that the values in my output are in fact memory addresses which could be a useful information leak for exploiting an RCE bug.\u201dYoung\u2019s final assessment of his test was that the fix was incomplete, he said. \u201cThe unbounded string copy was replaced with an appropriate memory safe function, but the return value was not properly considered,\u201d he wrote.Delayed Security AdvisoryYoung reported his findings to SonicWall PSIRT on Oct. 6 and followed up several times before receiving a response on Oct. 9 that \u201cconfirmed my expectation that this was the result of an improper fix for CVE-2020-5135, and told me that the patched firmware versions had already started to become available on mysonicwall.com as well as via Azure,\u201d he wrote.Six days later, Young said he received a response from the company that he would be informed when the memory-dump issue he identified was resolved and ready for release. He followed up again in March when he still had not heard back, he said.Ultimately, it would take until this Wednesday, June 22, before SonicWall would publicly post the advisory for the updated patch to the vulnerability, Young wrote.The security advisory also patches a number of other bugs in SonicWall platforms, a complete list of which is available in both the company\u2019s post and Young\u2019s analysis.(This article was updated on 6/23 at 12:30 p.m. ET to reflect additional reporting on a portion of a vulnerability not addressed by SonicWall\u2019s October patch. A clarification was also made to more clearly indicate that SonicWall\u2019s initial patch did mitigate the RCE bug.

Microsoft reported that six of the bugs are currently under active attack, while three are publicly known at the time of release.The number might seem light \u2013 it represents six fewer patches than Microsoft released in May \u2013 but the number of critical vulnerabilities ticked up to five month-over-month.Those actively exploited vulnerabilities can enable an attacker to hijack a system. They have no workarounds, so some security experts are recommending that they be patched as the highest priority.The six CVEs under active attack in the wild include four elevation of privilege vulnerabilities, one information disclosure vulnerability and one remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability.Critical Bugs of NoteCVE-2021-31985 is a critical RCE vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Defender antimalware software that should grab attention. A similar, critical bug in Defender was patched in January.

Jay Goodman, director of product marketing at Automox, said in a blog post that an attacker exploiting this vulnerability \u201ccould take control of a system where they would be free to install programs, view or change data, or create new accounts on the target system with full user rights.\u201d\nWhile Microsoft reports that this vulnerability is less likely to be exploited,Goodman suggested that organizations don\u2019t let it slide: \u201cPatching critical vulnerabilities in the 72-hour window before attackers can weaponize is an important first step to maintaining a safe and secure infrastructure,\u201d he observed.A year-to-date summary of 2021 Microsoft vulnerability releases as of June. Source: SophosBugs Exploited in the WildMicrosoft fixed a total of seven zero-day vulnerabilities. One was CVE-2021-31968, Windows Remote Desktop Services Denial of Service Vulnerability that was publicly disclosed but hasn\u2019t been seen in attacks. It was issued a CVSS score of 7.5.These are the six flaws that MIcrosoft said are under active attack, all of them also zero days.CVE-2021-31955 \u2013 Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability. Rating: Important. CVSS 5.5CVE-2021-31956 \u2013 Windows NTFS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. Rating: Important. CVSS 7.8CVE-2021-33739 \u2013 Microsoft DWM Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. Rating: Important. CVSS 8.4CVE-2021-33742 \u2013 Windows MSHTML Platform Remote Code Execution Vulnerability. Rating: Critical. CVSS 7.5CVE-2021-31199 \u2013 Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. Rating: Important. CVSS 5.2CVE-2021-31201 \u2013 Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability. Rating: Important. CVSS 5.2CVE-2021-33742This RCE vulnerability exploits MSHTML, a component used by the Internet Explorer engine to read and display content from websites.The bug could allow an attacker to execute code on a target system if a user views specially crafted web content. The Zero Day Initiative\u2018s (ZDI\u2019s) Dustin Childs noted in his Patch Tuesday analysis that since the vulnerability is in the Trident (MSHTML) engine itself, many different applications are affected, not just Internet Explorer. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear how widespread the active attacks are, but considering the vulnerability impacts all supported Windows versions, this should be at the top of your test and deploy list,\u201d he recommended.The vulnerability doesn\u2019t require special privilege to exploit, though the attack complexity is high, if that\u2019s any consolation. An attacker would need to do some extra legwork to pull it off, noted Satnam Narang, staff research engineer at Tenable, in an email to Threatpost on Tuesday.Immersive Labs\u2019 Kevin Breen, director of cyber threat research, noted that visiting a website in a vulnerable browser is \u201ca simple way for attackers to deliver this exploit.\u201d He told Threatpost via email on Tuesday that since the library is used by other services and applications, \u201cemailing HTML files as part of a phishing campaign is also a viable method of delivery.\u201dSophos decreed this one to be the top concern of this month\u2019s crop, given that it\u2019s already being actively exploited by malicious actors.CVE-2021-31955, CVE-2021-31956: Used in PuzzleMaker Targeted MalwareCVE-2021-31955 is an information disclosure vulnerability in the Windows Kernel, while CVE-2021-31956 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows NTFS. The ZDI\u2019s Childs noted that CVE-2021-31956 was reported by the same researcher who found CVE-2021-31955, an information disclosure bug also listed as under active attack. They could be linked, he suggested: \u201cIt\u2019s possible these bugs were used in conjunction, as that is a common technique \u2013 use a memory leak to get the address needed to escalate privileges. These bugs are important on their own and could be even worse when combined. Definitely prioritize the testing and deployment of these patches.\u201dHe was spot-on. On Tuesday, Kaspersky announced that its researchers had discovered a highly targeted malware campaign launched in April against multiple companies, in which a previously unknown threat actor used a chain of Chrome and Windows zero-day exploits: Namely, these two.In a press release, Kaspersky said that one of the exploits was used for RCE in the Google Chrome web browser, while the other was an elevation of privilege exploit fine-tuned to target \u201cthe latest and most prominent builds\u201d of Windows 10.\u201cRecent months have seen a wave of advanced threat activity exploiting zero-days in the wild,\u201d according to the release. \u201cIn mid-April, Kaspersky experts discovered yet a new series of highly targeted exploit attacks against multiple companies that allowed the attackers to stealthily compromise the targeted networks.\u201dKaspersky hasn\u2019t yet found a connection between these attacks and any known threat actors, so it\u2019s gone ahead and dubbed the actor PuzzleMaker. It said that all the attacks were conducted through Chrome and used an exploit that allowed for RCE. Kaspersky researchers weren\u2019t able to retrieve the code for the exploit, but the timeline and availability suggests the attackers were using the now-patched CVE-2021-21224 vulnerability in Chrome and Chromium browsers that allows attackers to exploit the Chrome renderer process (the processes that are responsible for what happens inside users\u2019 tabs).Kaspersky experts did find and analyze the second exploit, however: An elevation of privilege exploit that exploits two distinct vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows OS kernel: CVE-2021-31955 and CVE-2021-31956. The CVE-2021-31955 bug \u201cis affiliated with SuperFetch, a feature first introduced in Windows Vista that aims to reduce software loading times by pre-loading commonly used applications into memory,\u201d they explained.The second flaw, CVE-2021-31956, is an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability and heap-based buffer overflow. Kaspersky said that attackers used this vulnerability alongside Windows Notification Facility (WNF) \u201cto create arbitrary memory read/write primitives and execute malware modules with system privileges.\u201d\u201cOnce the attackers have used both the Chrome and Windows exploits to gain a foothold in the targeted system, the stager module downloads and executes a more complex malware dropper from a remote server,\u201d they continued. \u201cThis dropper then installs two executables, which pretend to be legitimate files belonging to Microsoft Windows OS. The second of these two executables is a remote shell module, which is able to download and upload files, create processes, sleep for certain periods of time, and delete itself from the infected system.\u201dBoris Larin, senior security researcher with Kaspersky\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT), said that the team hasn\u2019t been able to link these highly targeted attacks to any known threat actor: Hence the name PuzzleMaker and the determination to closely monitor the security landscape \u201cfor future activity or new insights about this group,\u201d he was quoted as saying in the press release.If the current trend is any indication, expect to see more of the same, Larin said. \u201cOverall, of late, we\u2019ve been seeing several waves of high-profile threat activity being driven by zero-day exploits,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that zero days continue to be the most effective method for infecting targets. Now that these vulnerabilities have been made publicly known, it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see an increase of their usage in attacks by this and other threat actors. That means it\u2019s very important for users to download the latest patch from Microsoft as soon as possible.\u201dCVE-2021-31199/CVE-2021-31201The two Enhanced Cryptographic Provider Elevation of Privilege vulnerabilities are linked to the Adobe Reader bug that came under active attack last month (CVE-2021-28550), ZDI explained. \u201cIt\u2019s common to see privilege escalation paired with code execution bugs, and it seems these two vulnerabilities were the privilege escalation part of those exploits,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is a bit unusual to see a delay between patch availability between the different parts of an active attack, but good to see these holes now getting closed.\u201dCVE-2021-33739Breen noted that privilege escalation vulnerabilities such as this one in the Microsoft DWM Core Library are just as valuable to attackers as RCEs. \u201cOnce they have gained an initial foothold, they can move laterally across the network and uncover further ways to escalate to system or domain-level access,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can be hugely damaging in the event of ransomware attacks, where high privileges can enable the attackers to stop or destroy backups and other security tools.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "T-Mobile confirmed that the extortion group Lapsus$ gains access to their system \u201cseveral weeks ago\u201d.The telecom giant responded to a report by a journalist Brian Krebs, who accessed the internal chats from the private Telegram channel of the core Lapsus$ gang members. The company added that it has mitigated the breach by terminating the hacker\u2019s group access to its network and disabled the stolen credentials that were used in the breach.Lapsus$ is a cybergang that came into prominence when it waged a ransomware attack against the Brazilian Ministry of Health in Feb 2021, compromising the data of COVID 19 vaccination data of millions. More recently, in March,\u00a0the City of London Police arrested\u00a0seven people suspected of being connected to the gang.\nPrivate chats uncovered by Krebs revealed that the Lapsus$ hacking group get hold of the T-Mobile VPN credentials on illicit platforms like the Russian Market. Using these credentials Lapsus$ members can get access to the company\u2019s internal tools like \u2013 Atlas an internal T-Mobile tool for managing customer accounts. It would help them to conduct a \u201cSim-Swapping\u201d Attack \u2013 In this attack, the hacker hijacks the victim\u2019s number by transferring it to the device owned by the attacker, this enables the hackers to obtain sensitive information such as phone number or any message sent for multi-factor authentication.After gaining access to ATLAS, Lapsus$ hackers also attempted to compromise the T-Mobile accounts associated with the FBI and Department of Defense but were unsuccessful as an additional verification method was linked to those accounts.\u201cSeveral weeks ago, our monitoring tools detected a bad actor using stolen credentials to access internal systems that house operational tools software,\u201d said a spokesperson from T-Mobile.T-Mobile said that despite the access attempts to the internal system \u2018Atlas\u2019 no sensitive information was leaked. \u201cThe systems accessed contained no customer or government information or other similarly sensitive information, and we have no evidence that the intruder was able to obtain anything of value,\u201d T-Mobile added.\u201cOur systems and processes worked as designed, the intrusion was rapidly shut down and closed off, and the compromised credentials used were rendered obsolete.\u201dRecently Lapsus$ attack increased and they primarily target the source code of big technology companies like Microsoft, Samsung, Okta, and Nvidia.The attacks carried out by Lapsus$ are not sophisticated, usually initiated by the stolen credentials from underground marketplaces, such as the Russian Market, and then an attempt to bypass the multi-factor authentication using social-engineering schemes.\u201cFrom a security pro who fought LAPSUS$: It forces us to shift thinking about insider access. Nation states want longer, strategic access; ransomware groups want lateral movement. LAPSUS$ asks: What can this account get me in the next 6 hours? We haven\u2019t optimized to defend that.\u201d said Brian Krebs in a tweet on Mar 24, 2022.From a security pro who fought LAPSUS$: It forces us to shift thinking about insider access.

A leaky API caused a data breach for 2.3 million customers in 2018. One year later in 2019 1.26 million prepaid were affected by a breach.In Aug 2021 T-Mobile suffered another data breach, where more than 40 million customer data were stolen. The account belongs to the former or prospective customer who has applied for credit with the company.The records of the customer were up for the sale in the same year, the breached data include Personal Identifiable Information such as \u2013 Social Security Numbers, Phone Numbers and Security PINs.\u00a0Reported By: Sagar Tiwari, an independent security researcher and technical writer.Breach",

        "raw text": "The number of cyberattacks launched against mobile users was down last year, researchers have found \u2014 but don\u2019t pop the champagne just yet. The decline was offset by jacked-up, more sophisticated, more nimble mobile nastiness.In a Monday report, Kaspersky said that its researchers have observed a downward trend in the number of attacks on mobile users, as shown in the chart below. However, \u201cattacks are becoming more sophisticated in terms of both malware functionality and vectors,\u201d according to Kaspersky experts Tatyana Shiskova and Anton Kivva.Number of attacks on mobile users, 2019\u20132021. Source: Kaspersky.Click to Register for FREE\u201cIn the reporting period, after a surge in H2 2020, cybercriminal activity gradually abated: There were no global newsbreaks or major campaigns, and the COVID-19 topic began to fade,\u201d according to Monday\u2019s report. \u201cAt the same time, new players continue to emerge on the cyberthreat market as malware becomes more sophisticated; thus, the fall in the overall number of attacks is \u2018compensated\u2019 by the greater impact of a successful attack. Most dangerous of all in this regard are banking malware and spyware.\u201dThe company\u2019s mobile products and technologies detected 97,661 new mobile banking trojans, along with 3,464,756 malicious installation packages and 17,372 new mobile ransomware trojans.The number of malicious installation packages observed in 2021 actually dropped substantially, down 2,218,938 from 2020 and slightly down from the 3,503,952 packages discovered in 2019.New Tricks for Mobile Banking MalwareLast year, banking trojans learned a number of new tricks. For example, the Fakecalls banker, which targets Korean mobile users, is now \u201c[dropping] outgoing calls to the victim\u2019s bank and plays pre-recorded operator responses stored in the trojan\u2019s body,\u201d according to the report.Other old dogs learning new tricks include the Sova banker, which steals cookies, \u201cenabling attackers to access the user\u2019s current session and personal mobile banking account without knowing the login credentials.\u201dIn 2021, cybercriminals also went after mobile gaming credentials \u2013 which are often sold later on the darknet or used to steal in-game goods from users. Last year, for example, marked the first time that researchers spotted what they called a \u201cGamethief-type mobile trojan,\u201d aimed at stealing account credentials for the mobile version of PlayerUnknown\u2019s Battlegrounds (PUBG).As well, the Vultur backdoor \u2013 found packed into a malicious, fully functional two-factor authentication (2FA) app discovered last month on Google Play \u2013 picked up the capability of using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) to snoop on targets by recording smartphone screens: \u201cWhen the user opens an app that is of interest to attackers, they can monitor the on-screen events,\u201d researchers said.Other trends spotted in 2021: fewer pandemic/COVID-19 topics used as bait, and more pop-culture lures, such as Squid Game. Kaspersky pointed to the Joker trojan on Google Play, which was found masquerading \u201cas an app with a background wallpaper in the style of Squid Game.\u201dGoogle Play Still InfestedSpeaking of the malware-ridden Play Store, regardless of Google\u2019s attempts to scrub its app store clean, it\u2019s still a bit of a roach motel. ThreatFabric researchers recently sniffed out 300,000 banking trojan infections in Google Play during a four-month period.Kaspersky also called out what it said were \u201crepeat incidents of malicious code injection into popular apps through advertising SDKs,\u201d as in the \u201csensational\u201d case of CamScanner: a malicious app spotted in the Google Play store in August 2019 that tallied 100 million downloads.Researchers noted that they also found malicious code inside ad libraries in the official client for the third-party marketplace known as APKpure, as well as in a modified WhatsApp build.One example was particularly alarming, from a security hygiene perspective: the malicious, fully functional 2FA app that hung out in Google Play for more than two weeks, managing to cling to 10,000 downloads. It came loaded with the Vultur stealer malware that targets and swoops down on financial data.Among all of last year\u2019s many banking-trojans moves, researchers found the resurgence of Joker especially notable. The malware, which zaps victims with premium SMS charges, popped up yet again on Google Play, in a mobile app called Color Message, after which it snuck into more than a half-million downloads before the store collared it.Kaspersky researchers also called out the Facestealer trojan: a family of Android trojans that uses social engineering to rip off victims\u2019 Facebook credentials.These trojans most commonly sneak into Google Play by masquerading as a legitimate app, such as a photo editor or VPN service, to which they add a small code snippet to decrypt and launch their payload, the researchers explained. To confound analysis, such malware often uses a command-and-control (C2) server to send unpacking commands that get carried out in multiple steps: \u201cEach decrypted module contains the address of the next one, plus instructions for decrypting it,\u201d they said.Most of It\u2019s Still AdwareAt 42 percent, adware was yet again the biggest slice of the mobile malware pie, even though it fell 14.83 percentage points over the prior year. In 2020, adware was also the No. 1 mobile menace, at 57 percent.Next in prevalence were potentially unwanted riskware apps at 35 percent: a share increase of 14 percentage points, after a sharp decline in 2019\u20132020. As defined by Kaspersky, riskware are legitimate programs \u201cthat pose potential risks due to security vulnerability, software incompatibility or legal violations.\u201dIn third place were trojan threats at 9 percent: a share that rose by 4 percentage points year-over-year.Join Threatpost on Wed.

        "raw text": "According to a recent survey from Ivanti, nearly three-quarters (74 percent) of IT professionals reported that their organizations have fallen victim to a phishing attack \u2013 and 40 percent of those happened in the last month alone. Increasingly, mobile phishing is the culprit.What\u2019s more, nearly half of these professionals cited a lack of the necessary IT talent as one of the core reasons for the increased risk of phishing attacks.So how can organizations overcome the sudden increase in security threats and regain the upper hand against bad actors with fewer resources than ever before? Increasingly, it looks like zero-trust will become the ideal approach for doing more with less, because ultimately, it\u2019s the users and their cyber-hygiene that\u2019s the first line in phishing defense.Let\u2019s take a look at the latest phishing trends.Where Big Phish Lurk in the Everywhere PondAs organizations across all industries have shifted to distributed work environments, it\u2019s no longer the task of security teams to manage access to data and systems from a specific location. Rather, employees are accessing work-related information on their personal devices from locations all over the globe, making it significantly more challenging for IT personnel to track and verify each and every connected device. Because of this shift, bad actors have evolved their phishing attacks and are now focusing their efforts on employees\u2019 personal mobile devices \u2013 and as our survey results showed, are finding great success with this approach. Hackers have also been leveraging botnet infections to harvest legitimate emails to create more convincing phishing attacks that are highly effective. This is concerning, as phishing attacks often evolve into ransomware attacks.\u00a0\nThe annualized risk of a data breach resulting from phishing attacks has a median value of about $1.7 million, and a long-tail value of about $90 million \u2013 and this high risk for your organization proves a high reward for bad actors. Recent research from Aberdeen further emphasizes this risk, finding that attackers have a higher success rate on mobile endpoints than on servers. As anyone, no matter how technically savvy, is at risk of falling victim to phishing attacks, it\u2019s vital that organizations rethink their approach to security as a whole to combat these threats.Checklist for a Zero-Trust ApproachYour company\u2019s security lies first and foremost in the cyber-hygiene of employees \u2013 and that\u2019s why the user experience should be a core focus of any security strategy. As remote work establishes itself as the new normal, ensuring that best practices are as simple as possible to complete will make or break your security efforts. And a zero-trust approach can provide organizations with the best of both worlds.Zero-trust security requires organizations to continually verify any and all devices that are connected to its network every single time, with zero exceptions. As part of a zero-trust strategy, organizations should look to the following strategies:Leverage machine learning to conduct continuous device posture assessment, role-based user access control and location awareness before granting access to data. Automate routine security updates \u2013 thus eliminating the risk of employees delaying necessary security patches and other updates.Invest in mobile threat-detection software that can detect and thwart issues in real time.\u00a0Eliminate passwords from the business landscape entirely and replace these security processes with multifactor authentication (MFA) that utilizes biometrics or other information to verify users and eliminate the overall \u201cphishability\u201d of routine login processes. Through these tactics, organizations can streamline key security processes and continually secure all endpoints to minimize threat risk faster than ever before.\u00a0Plenty of Phish in the SeaThe modern threat landscape has transformed entirely \u2013 and as new avenues and opportunities for phishing scams arise, bad actors will continue inventing new attack tactics, hoping to outsmart your organization\u2019s employees and make them take the bait. As a result, organizations can no longer rely on traditional security protocols to protect themselves in the work-from-anywhere environment, especially since users continue to be a weak link.After all, the Ivanti survey found that one third (34 percent) of those surveyed blame the increase on phishing attacks on a lack of employee understanding, and even fewer (30 percent) said 80-90 percent of their organizations had completed security trainings offered by their companies. Luckily, by implementing a zero-trust security strategy \u2013 including implementing multifactor authentication, automating security updates and more \u2014 organizations will be better equipped to mitigate these threats as they arise and protect their business-critical systems and information.\u00a0Neither your employees nor bad actors intend to go back to the way they used to work. It\u2019s time your security strategy adapts to the modern business landscape, too.Daniel Spicer is Chief Security Officer at Ivanti.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our microsite.\u00a0\u00a0InfoSec InsiderNewsVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The North Korea-linked ScarCruft advanced persistent threat (APT) group has developed a fresh, multiplatform malware family for attacking North Korean defectors, journalists and government organizations involved in Korean Peninsula affairs.Since 2019, ScarCruft (aka APT37 or Temp.Reaper) has been using spyware dubbed Chinotto to target victims for espionage purposes, according to an analysis from Kaspersky, although the code only recently came to the attention of researchers.Chinotto is triple-pronged, with the ultimate double-pronged goal of surveilling victims across mobile and desktop.\u201cThe actor utilized three types of malware with similar functionalities: Versions implemented in PowerShell, Windows executables and Android applications,\u201d researchers noted in a Monday blog posting. \u201cAlthough intended for different platforms, they share a similar command-and-control scheme based on HTTP communication. Therefore, the malware operators can control the whole malware family through one set of command-and-control scripts.\u201dScarCruft specifically controls the malware using a PHP script on a compromised web server, directing the binaries based on HTTP parameters.Inside the Chinotto BackdoorChinotto has various tricks up its sleeve, researchers said, including detection evasion (i.e., employing garbage code to impede analysis) and establishing persistence via the registry key. And as far as the actual spyware functionality goes, it \u201cshows fully fledged capabilities to control and exfiltrate sensitive information from the victims,\u201d according to Kaspersky, across three types of variants: a Windows executable, a PowerShell version and an Android application.\u201cThe actor targeted victims with a probable spear-phishing attack for Windows systems and smishing for Android systems,\u201d according to Kaspersky. \u201cThe actor leverages Windows executable versions and PowerShell versions to control Windows systems. We may presume that if a victim\u2019s host and mobile are infected at the same time, the malware operator is able to overcome two-factor authentication by stealing SMS messages from the mobile phone.\u201dWhen it comes to the Windows executable, the backdoor continuously queries its command-and-control (C2) server, awaiting commands from the malware operator. The commands include beaconing, executing Windows commands, downloading and uploading specific files, uploading log files, archiving and uploading whole directories, collecting and uploading all files with specific extensions, taking screenshots, and updating the malware.Meanwhile, a different Chinotto variant contains an embedded PowerShell script, according to the analysis.\u201cIt contains additional backdoor commands, such as uploading and downloading capabilities,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cBased on the build timestamp of the malware, we assess that the malware author used the PowerShell embedded version from mid-2019 to mid-2020 and started to use the malicious, PowerShell-less Windows executable from the end of 2020 onward.\u201dAnd finally, there\u2019s also an Android application version of Chinotto, Kaspersky found. It comes in the form of a malicious APK that requests excessive permissions, which allows the app to collect sensitive information. This includes SMS messages, messaging app messages, contact lists, stored account information, call logs, device information and audio recordings of phone calls.\u201cEach sample has a different package name, with the analyzed sample bearing \u2018com.secure.protect\u2019 as a package name,\u201d researchers explained.Chinotto enables the operator to steal any information across desktop and mobile, which can then be used in follow-on attacks, researchers noted: \u201cFor example, the group attempts to infect additional valuable hosts and contact potential victims using stolen social-media accounts or email accounts.\u201dSpear-Phishing SpycraftKaspersky discovered the malware while conducting a forensic investigation on one victim that runs a business related to North Korea. The attack had started on social media when a ScarCruft representative contacted an acquaintance of the victim using the victim\u2019s stolen Facebook account.\u201cAfter a conversation on social media, the actor sent a spear-phishing email to the potential victim using a stolen email account,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe actor leveraged their attacks using stolen login credentials, such as Facebook and personal email accounts, and thereby showed a high level of sophistication.\u201dThe spear-phishing email contained a password-protected .RAR archive with the password shown in the email body; the RAR file in turn contained a malicious Word document entitled, \u201cNorth Korea\u2019s latest situation and our national security.\u201dThis document contained a malicious macro that kicked off a multi-stage infection process.\u201cWe suspect this host was compromised on March 22,\u201d researchers said. \u201cAfter the initial infection, the actor attempted to implant additional malware, but an error occurred that led to the crash of the malware. The malware operator later delivered the Chinotto malware in August 2021 and probably started to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim.\u201dAs for attribution, Kaspersky researchers discovered several code overlaps with an older known ScarCruft malware named POORWEB as well as a document-stealer malware the APT is known to use. This, combined with the victimology (South Korean journalists, diplomats and government employees), pointed to ScarCruft, according to the analysis.\u201cMany journalists, defectors and human rights activists are targets of sophisticated cyberattacks,\u201d the firm concluded. \u201cWhile hunting for related activity, we uncovered an older set of activity dating back to mid-2020, possibly indicating that ScarCruft operations against this set of individuals have been operating for a longer period of time.\u201dThere\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "Most users who install applications through legitimate channels such as the Google Play Store or the Apple Store do so with complete trust that their information is safe from malicious attacks. This makes sense, because they\u2019re the official app stores for across the globe.However, despite tight security measures by Google and Apple, cybercriminals still find ways to bypass these checks. They do this through app impersonation.For instance, since Android lets users side-load and install apps downloaded from non-store sources, cyberattackers take advantage by creating clone apps that mimic legitimate ones. They then use the fake apps to collect data or credentials for malicious use.An example was when India banned TikTok. A clone called TikTok Pro came up immediately with malicious intentions to steal data from users\u2019 devices. Attackers also took advantage of COVID-19 fears to collect user data through fake tracking apps.Cybercriminals are capitalizing on the remote-work trend as more companies allow employees to access business applications through mobile devices. Additionally, personal internet networks rarely have the kind of security measures available within an office environment, such as firewalls, which creates ample room for attackers to scrape business data.Below we look at ways to identify app impersonation, tools to defend yourself from attacks and measures to put in place for better security.2 Types of App ImpersonationIn addition to the examples given above, app impersonation occurs in many other ways. Remember, the sole nefarious intent of a cybercriminal is to access user data, backend APIs and business information. Below are the two primary app impersonation methods identified in 2021:Hackers have found an opportunity through cloning applications by creating similar-looking applications that impersonate legitimate ones. Hackers collect sensitive information such as banking details, credit-card information and biometric information through the cloned applications.As much as Google Play has implemented more robust security measures, they sometimes prove ineffective because this is purely a cat-and-mouse game; as soon as the rogue mobile apps get pulled out of the store, they come in again in another guise. Moreover, side-loading of apps is inadvisable but still happens, creating another attack vector.Cybercriminals use the information they steal for malicious purposes like account takeover, to redirect payments or to syphon off rewards points. Or, the objective may be as simple as selling personal information on the Dark Web.API manipulation is a mechanism aimed at stealing business or personal data, or gaming a company\u2019s business for commercial gain.\u00a0 It\u2019s carried out by exploiting vulnerabilities or bugs in the APIs themselves, or by using valid credentials which have been stolen from other businesses \u2013 or bought on the Dark Web \u2013 in order to access back-end systems. Both attack vectors are based on scripts and use API keys which have been extracted from the mobile apps. Gartner\u2019s research estimates that APIs will be the leading attack surface by 2022.How to Defend against App ImpersonationThese are three main methods that have proven effective defenses against mobile app impersonation:Many people believe that protecting mobile apps protects the APIs that they consume. Unfortunately, this is false logic. In reality, a genuine mobile app is a hacking toolbox for bad actors since they can use it to architect and implement fake versions of the app.Further, they can study the API requests/responses and quickly build a script which generates API sequences which are indistinguishable from genuine mobile app traffic.It is therefore important to consider API security separately from mobile app security. An effective API-protection tool must be able to verify that incoming API requests are coming from genuine mobile app instances which are operating in uncompromised runtime environments.Attackers know that if they can get a fake app installed on your mobile device, they can manipulate your intentions as well as extracting valuable business and personal data. Preventing fake apps from entering the official app stores is probably impossible, as is stopping users from side-loading apps from other sources, but what can be done is to ensure that none of these bad apps can communicate with your backend systems.Mobile app attestation is a highly cryptographically secure method through which an app can be proved to be a genuine instance of the original app which was uploaded into the app stores. If this proof can be passed to the backend system along with each API call, it is possible to shut out all fake apps, regardless of if they came from the app stores or through side-loading.Penetration testing regularly exposes vulnerabilities by simulating potential attacks on your application to identify loopholes before hackers gain access to them. The best practice is to work with an external pentester, because they\u2019re less familiar with your systems and can independently identify flaws more effectively.There are two pentesting methods:Internal pentesting: Where testing occurs behind an app\u2019s firewall to simulate an inside attack such as someone using stolen credentials.External pentesting: An external pentest simulates attacks on public company assets such as a website and mobile applications, to identify potential loopholes that attackers might use to attack the company or its customers.Best Practices Against App ImpersonationThe best defensive tool against app impersonation will protect user information as well as your APIs, so you can focus on building better features and growing your platform.These tools should integrate into your iOS or Android mobile app by installing an SDK that interacts with a cloud service which can verify the app\u2019s authenticity. A short (~5 minute) lifetime token could be passed to your API backend for instance, to prove that the API request is from a genuine source and meets all the runtime requirements.Every transaction should also be checked against a security policy that you define, providing an end-to-end security process for your app and your APIs.Dave Stewart is CEO at Approov.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our micrositeCloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderMalwareMobile SecurityPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Over the last several years, as the Android ecosystem matured, widely-distributed malware with rooting capabilities has become rare. But its rarity doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not still a threat.By definition, rooting malware is extremely dangerous because it can gain privileged access to the Android operating system. This enables the malware to grant itself further permissions, change system settings and install additional malware, steps that usually require user interaction. Armed with these invasive controls, threat actors can then conduct targeted phishing attacks, steal sensitive data needed to compromise user accounts or conduct surveillance.Register now for our LIVE event!Recently, the Lookout Threat Lab uncovered the first widespread rooting malware campaign in five years. Dubbed AbstractEmu due to its use of code extraction and anti-emulation checks to avoid detection, the malware was found on Google Play and other prominent third-party app stores such as Amazon Appstore and the Samsung Galaxy Store. Lookout notified Google and the apps were promptly removed.Using AbstractEmu as an example. Here are things you should look for to ensure you don\u2019t fall victim to rooting malware.There Are Plenty of Vulnerabilities to Go AroundAbstractEmu is a great example of how threat actors can leverage rooting exploits to indiscriminately target the general population. Most vulnerabilities, once discovered, are patched over with updates. But users are protected only if they take the time to update their devices.There are numerous vulnerabilities within the Android ecosystem that are ripe to be exploited. This campaign targets very contemporary vulnerabilities from 2019 and 2020, including CVE-2020-0041, a vulnerability not previously seen used in the wild. AbstractEmu also targeted CVE-2020-0069, a vulnerability found in MediaTek chips used by dozens of smartphone manufacturers. Collectively, there are millions of devices that are affected by this vulnerability.Things Are Not Always What They Seem: Trojanized AppsSomething that is not unique to rooting malware, but has aided the distribution of the AbstractEmu campaign, is trojanizing apps. By disguising its malicious intent behind seemingly innocuous apps, the threat actor is able to lure unsuspecting users into downloading the malware.Lookout researchers found a total of 19 apps related to the malware, seven of which contained rooting functionalities. One app that was found on Google Play was confirmed to have been downloaded more than 10,000 times. AbstractEmu disguised itself as a number of different apps, including utility apps, such as password managers, and system tools like app launchers or data savers.AbstractEmu does not have sophisticated zero-click remote exploit functionality used in advanced APT-style threats like Pegasus. But it doesn\u2019t need this capability, since the malware will be activated when the user opens the trojanized app shortly after downloading it.Rare or Not, Always Use Cybersecurity Best PracticesProtecting yourself against AbstractEmu highlights a couple of the cybersecurity best practices that we should all keep in mind, whether you\u2019re an IT professional or just an individual. Tablets and smartphones are how most of us stay connected to work and manage personal responsibilities, which means they hold an immense amount of data. These devices are also very sophisticated and have countless functionalities that bad actors can leverage.To protect yourself and your organization, you should always keep your device\u2019s operating system up to date. I also recommend using official app stores only, and even then, exercise caution when downloading something unknown to you.Hank Schless is senior manager of security solutions at Lookout.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.InfoSec InsiderMalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "There are two essential elements driving progress in today\u2019s digital-first economy: Mobile applications and the application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow\u00a0 those applications to communicate and exchange data with each other.The growth in these two technologies has exposed users and their data to significant security threats, namely:Hackers can easily access devices through mobile apps.Unsecured APIs expose personal identifiable information (PII) to potential attackers.Mobile app security threats have arisen over the years. Below are some alarming statistics:In 2019, 93 percent of mobile transactions in up to 20 markets were found to be fraudulent and blocked.According to Microsoft, 60 percent of an organization\u2019s endpoints are mobile and unprotected. The pandemic has led to more teams working remotely and using their mobile devices for work. Research by IBM has established that remote teams increase the average costs of a data breach by $137,000.19 million dollars is the average cost of a data breach.Read on for the top attack routes the bad guys use and the best defenses organizations can deploy against them.How Bad Actors Exploit Mobile Attack Surfaces To Hack Your DeviceMobile applications work with the assumption that legitimate users use your app without malicious intentions. As a result, hackers will use attack surfaces to extract confidential information they can use to penetrate your device. There are five attack surfaces that bad actors target to gain access to your data:User CredentialsApp IntegrityDevice IntegrityAPI Channel IntegrityAPI and Service VulnerabilitiesThe Process of Targeting Your ApplicationsA cybercriminal can launch an attack across the surfaces above through the detailed process we outline below:There are four ways of preparing an attack:Acquire user credentials through phishing, spoofing and data acquired through the Dark Web. This data is typically gained through data breaches and sold to shady web intermediaries.Attack the app\u2019s integrity to extract the API\u2019s information and abuse the app\u2019s business function.Abuse the device\u2019s integrity to acquire client information for malicious reasons.Tamper with channel integrity to intercept secrets and gain access to the app\u2019s logic.After preparing the paths to gain access and collect information, these are the methods hackers use to execute their attack strategy:Use acquired information to construct valid queries and set up automated tools that target the API.Harvest data using new or commonly known loopholes such as fake application forms, links and attachments containing malware.Abuse the API business logic to request more money from users or to push users to make false purchases.Interfere with the operation of the service to slow down or divert user requests.Use harvested information to tamper with the app and deploy a modified version to divert financial transactions, advertising revenue or steal data.7 Ways To Protect Mobile Apps and APIs from AttackersBelow are the best strategies to protect your mobile applications from hackers:Approve secure connections only after authenticating the identity of the server request. To authenticate user identities, implement Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocols on the app\u2019s transport channels that scan sensitive data such as credentials and tokens.You should also use certificate pinning and industry-approved certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authority providers to prevent self-signed certificates.Input validation checks if credentials and login information is structured appropriately to prevent harmful code from accessing your app.Validation takes place before a mobile application accepts the user\u2019s personal information. This process protects the app from attackers injecting destructive code into your app.Input validation should also apply to your third-party vendors and partners. Attackers might try to hack your app by pretending to be your service provider or a trusted regulator.Your mobile app\u2019s data storage is another avenue that attackers can target. Vulnerabilities occur in storage places such as SQL databases, cookies, configuration files and binary data stores. Additionally, dangerous actors circumvent poorly implemented security features by bypassing encryption libraries. A common avenue that attackers target is jail-broken or rooted devices. When the owner jail-breaks/roots their device, they undermine the gadget\u2019s in-built security, making it easier for hackers to gain access.To protect your data stores from attackers, encrypt local files that contain sensitive information using your device\u2019s security library. You can also reduce the number of app requests and permissions to prevent apps from gaining access.To reduce insecure and low-quality code instances, apply secure coding practices such as the OWASP Secure Coding Guidelines and use status analysis tools such as MobSF to check the security of your work during the development process.Maintain consistent, secure coding principles that do not result in vulnerable code.Once your code is ready to deploy, don\u2019t forget to apply an obfuscation tool such as ProGuard to place a cloak around your labors and keep prying eyes off it.There are multiple ways to ensure proper authorization and authentication to protect mobile apps from attacks:Always authenticate requests from the server end. Authentication prevents malformed and harmful data from being loaded into the mobile application.Use encryption to safely protect the client\u2019s and your data, especially if the app requires access to the client\u2019s storage.Always verify permissions of authenticated users by only using backend data. Verification prevents attackers from using similar-looking credentials to gain access to your backend information and APIs.Use two-factor authentication to validate a user\u2019s credentials and identity.Reverse engineering is one way that hackers apply to attack an app\u2019s integrity. To prevent such scenarios, limit the client\u2019s capabilities and retain most of the app\u2019s functionality to the server\u2019s side. For example, reduce user functionality and client-side permissions to prevent hackers from gaining access to your codebase. API keys are a security risk on their own and are difficult to hide in a mobile app. So protect their illegitimate use by ensuring that a second, independent factor is required by the backend server alongside the API key to mitigate the risk.7. API Threat ProtectionAPI Threat Protection technology offers organizations a run-time shielding solution that is easy to deploy and protects your mobile apps, APIs, and the channel between them from any automated attack. This technology effectively blocks the execution of attacks, irrespective of the already known vulnerabilities or those uncovered through testing. In addition, and can verifies your app\u2019s run-time safety and authenticity for optimum device protection.David Stewart is CEO at Approov.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.\u00a0HacksInfoSec InsiderMobile Security",

        "raw text": "On Thursday, a 21-year-old US citizen claiming to be the attacker who stole data on more than 50 million T-Mobile customers called the telecom\u2019s security \u201cawful.\u201dOn Friday, a \u201chumbled\u201d T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert wiped the egg from his face and apologized for the debacle, the repercussions of which have affected a total of more than 50 million customers at this point. As of Aug. 18, T-Mobile had estimated the total number of ripped-off records to be ~40 million: a number that rose to ~50 million on Aug. 20 and could double if the purported thief is true to his word.When the breach was widely reported 11 days ago, the purported thief was offering to sell 30 million records for ~1 penny each on an underground forum: what he claimed was a subset of 100 million customer records. He alleged that he was going to sell the other 50 million privately. As of Thursday, he hadn\u2019t acknowledged having sold any of the records.The Wall Street Journal has been chatting with the purported attacker via Telegram for a while. The news outlet has confirmed that his name is John Binns: a 21-year-old US citizen of Turkish descent who moved to Turkey a few years ago. Binns reportedly discussed details about the breach before they were widely known.The WSJ noted that T-Mobile was initially notified of the breach by a cybersecurity company called Unit221B LLC, which said that the telecom\u2019s customer data was being peddled on the dark web.Who is John Binns?Binns told the WSJ that he conducted the attack from his home in Izmir, Turkey, where he lives with his mother. His father, who died when he was two, was American, while his mother is Turkish. They moved back to Turkey when Binns was 18.If the name rings a bell, it\u2019s because the seller told Alon Gal, CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, that this sucker-punch to US infrastructure was done in retaliation against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Binns at the hands of CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019, as Gal tweeted at the time (from an account that has since been suspended).This breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019. We did it to harm US infrastructure. \u2014Attacker\u2019s alleged statement to GalIt\u2019s not clear who \u201cwe\u201d refers to, but Binns said he needed help. In his conversation with the WSJ, Binns described the attack as a \u201ccollaborative effort to find the login credentials needed to crack T-Mobile\u2019s internal databases,\u201d and that another online actor offered, in online forums, to sell some of the stolen T-Mobile data.Binns sued the FBI, CIA and Department of Justice in 2020, alleging that he was tortured and harassed by the US and Turkish governments and is seeking to compel the US to release documents regarding these activities under the Freedom of Information Act. He told the WSJ that the kidnapping story is legitimate \u2013 why would he lie?:I have no reason to make up a fake kidnapping story and I\u2019m hoping that someone within the FBI leaks information about that. \u2014John Binns, as quoted by the WSJBinns reportedly uses the online handles IRDev and v0rtex, among others. He\u2019s apparently got a track record that includes \u201cperipheral involvement\u201d in the creation of a massive botnet of compromised devices that was used for online attacks four years ago, having been in cahoots with the gamers who infected devices around the world.These botnets are often used by gamers to knock people and websites offline in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The pandemic caused a surge in such attacks: As of September 2020, more people were online during lockdowns and work-from-home shifts, making for lucrative pickings for DDoS-ers.T-Mobile\u2019s \u2018Awful\u2019 SecurityBinns told the WSJ that he penetrated T-Mobile\u2019s defenses in July after scanning the company\u2019s known internet addresses, looking for weak spots and using what the publication called \u201ca simple tool available to the public.\u201d (That tool well might have been Shodan: a search engine used to uncover servers connected to the internet that\u2019s often used by threat actors and researchers to find vulnerabilities.)He found an unprotected, exposed router last month, he told the Journal. From there, Binns said he managed to break into T-Mobile\u2019s data center outside East Wenatchee, Wash., where he reportedly accessed more than 100 servers that contained the personal data of millions. By Aug. 4, he had stolen millions of files thanks to what he told the Journal was the mobile phone seller\u2019s pathetic security:I was panicking because I had access to something big. Their security is awful. \u2014John Binns, as quoted by the WSJBinns shared this screenshot of internal T-Mobile servers that displayed warnings against unauthorized access.Source: WSJ.\u00a0Tables of personal information that Binns told the WSJ that he found in T-Mobile\u2019s internal systems. Source: WSJ.Cybersecurity experts have been nodding vigorously, albeit in more diplomatic terms than \u201cawful.\u201d The Journal spoke with Glenn Gerstell, a former general counsel for the National Security Agency, who said that the fact that the theft included records stolen from prospective clients or former, long-gone customers shows that somebody or somebodies at T-Mobile isn\u2019t practicing good data management hygiene: \u201cThat to me does not sound like good data management practices,\u201d he was quoted as saying.Granted, that work gets harder all the time. Randy Watkins, chief technology officer at cybersecurity consulting and managed detection and response (MDR) services company CRITICALSTART, told Threatpost on Friday that the attack shows how difficult it is to secure growing perimeters and how tough it is to monitor attack surfaces.Watkins warned that alerts set off by an intruder\u2019s activity \u2013 including initial compromise, subsequent lateral movement and data exfiltration\u2013 are dismissed at an organization\u2019s peril: \u201cEven if this generated alerts, they would likely be low-priority, and something that would be disregarded as a likely false-positive,\u201d he said via email. \u201cAs attackers take advantage of these less-obvious tactics, it is becoming more critical to resolve every alert generated by detection toolsets.\u201dSomething\u2019s Wrong in Magenta LandBy some accounts, this is the sixth time that T-Mobile has been attacked in recent years.The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said last week that it\u2019s investigating this most recent breach. T-Mobile is also facing at least two class-action lawsuits accusing the company, the second-largest US wireless carrier, of failing to protect customer data.T-Mobile was attacked twice last year, and in 2018, about 2.5 million customers had their data exposed in a network breach. That attack also became part of a federal class-action lawsuit.The most recent theft involved the records of more than 13 million current customers, more than 40 million prospective customers who had applied for credit with the company, and 667,000 former customers, T-Mobile said last week. An additional 902,000 prepaid customers also had some data exposed.Some records contained Social Security numbers, phone numbers, names, security PINs, physical addresses, unique IMEI numbers, IMSI numbers, driver license numbers and dates of birth: in short, all the ingredients necessary for identity theft.A source familiar with the investigation told the WSJ that the Seattle office of the FBI is investigating.The Latest From T-MobileOn Friday, T-Mobile\u2019s CEO, Mike Sievert, announced that the company has sought help on the cybersecurity front. He said in a statement that the company has entered into long-term partnerships with Mandiant and with consulting firm KPMG LLP.\u201cWe know we need additional expertise to take our cybersecurity efforts to the next level \u2013 and we\u2019ve brought in the help,\u201d Sievert said. \u201cThese arrangements are part of a substantial multi-year investment to adopt best-in-class practices and transform our approach. This is all about assembling the firepower we need to improve our ability to fight back against criminals and building a future-forward strategy to protect T-Mobile and our customers.\u201dWith regards to details behind the attack, Sievert painted this as the work of an erudite threat actor. \u201cWhat we can share is that, in simplest terms, the bad actor leveraged their knowledge of technical systems, along with specialized tools and capabilities, to gain access to our testing environments and then used brute force attacks and other methods to make their way into other IT servers that included customer data,\u201d he was quoted as saying in Friday\u2019s statement.Security experts weren\u2019t too sure about T-Mobile\u2019s characterization of this as a fancy attack.Well, Good Luck With All ThatSome security experts said that the move to pull in the security big guns is a good step, but T-Mobile\u2019s got a lot of gunk to scrape out, and it won\u2019t happen overnight. Ian McShane, Field CTO of security firm Arctic Wolf and former Gartner analyst, told Threatpost that, given how many breaches T-Mobile has suffered over the last few years, he\u2019s already skeptical about the company\u2019s claims that the breach was a \u201chighly sophisticated\u201d attack. \u201cI\u2019m sure many others in our industry will be just as keen as I am to understand the cause and the lessons learned, especially as it seems the internal investigation was only sparked by posts from a Twitter account with what appeared to be inside knowledge,\u201d he said.Mark Manglicmot, vice president of security services at Arctic Wolf, told Threatpost that one of the poor practices brought to light by the breach is storing Social Security numbers in plain text. \u201cEncryption of this data is a mandatory part of the security equation,\u201d he pointed out.Moreover, since this is T-Mobile\u2019s sixth such breach in a few years, it\u2019s apparent \u201cthey haven\u2019t taken security seriously enough,\u201d Manglicmot continued. \u201cTheir IT asset management and patching of systems is poor. The combination of poor defenses and a lack of capable real-time detection and response is a recipe for this type of data theft disaster. Once a data rich company like T-Mobile experiences a breach, the flood-gates open to other attackers to find additional cracks. Reports are stating their security is a mess. It\u2019s a good step that they are bringing in reputable help to investigate and bolster defenses, but it\u2019s going to take T-Mobile years to fully get their security program on par with their responsibility to customers.\u201dThen too, there\u2019s that throbbing sore thumb: namely, the exposed router. Agio founder and CEO Bart McDonough pointed out to Threatpost that the unsecured router that Binns claimed to have exploited \u201cappears to have had a different configuration than other routers. The hacker exploited the weakness in this non-standard configuration.\u201d T-Mobile should have had an AI-based anomaly detection system in place, he said: one that might have caught the aberrant login and resulting data exfiltration, \u201callowing T-Mobile to perhaps minimize the damage from this attack.\u201dMany businesses aren\u2019t as complex as T-Mobile; nor do they get targeted with such intensity. Still, there are lessons to be learned for other businesses, McDonough observed. \u201cAll businesses could benefit from enhancing their cybersecurity fundamentals. Specifically, deploying device configuration management, access management, and AI-based detection of anomalous and suspicious network activity.\u201dAs it is, many, if not most, organizations only have a static awareness of their \u201csurface\u201d, e.g. internal systems exposed to the Internet, he continued. \u201cWhen an administrator makes a change (or mistake) the new exposure point should set off alarms and someone should be asking the question \u2018is that system, router, etc. presenting what we are intending?'\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.BreachHacksMobile SecurityNewsWeb Security",

        "raw text": "What\u2019s the opposite of a resilient operation?It\u2019s when your wireless carrier gets breached for the sixth time in a few years, you try to change your PIN online, and the site tells you \u201cNo can do.\u201dAs of Wednesday, T-Mobile had confirmed its sixth breach over the last three years. The purported thief/thieves posted a list of 30 million customer records for sale on the underground over the weekend and claimed they were keeping another ~70 million to sell privately, for a total of 100 million purportedly stolen records. (T-Mobile, for its part, has only discovered ~40 million leaked records, but its investigation is ongoing, so take that number with a few tens of millions of salt grains.)I\u2019m a T-Mobile customer. I went online to change my T-Mobile PIN when the news broke. I got some kind of 404-like message, telling me the operation couldn\u2019t be performed at the time (sorry, I didn\u2019t think to screengrab it).Jennifer Bisceglie is the founder and CEO of Interos \u2013 a company that offers a SaaS platform that uses artificial intelligence to model business ecosystems into a living, global map, down to any single supplier. She defines the opposite of corporate resilience as when things fall apart following a security incident or, for that matter, any type of disaster, be it the choking of the Suez Canal that led to a supply-chain crisis and Apple subsequently missing its earnings. It\u2019s COVID. It\u2019s business paralysis that could potentially be avoided with proper insight into operations and bounce-back capabilities.\u201cReally, it\u2019s just making sure that operations can continue,\u201d she said when she visited Threatpost podcast this week. \u201cAnd we talk about prioritizing. Too late it\u2019s things like this, right. It\u2019s things like what we saw at the pandemic where Apple came out, very public and missed their earnings. It\u2019s when the Suez Canal, the ship got stuck and people didn\u2019t know if they had alternative sources for the demand, it\u2019s the semiconductor industry that doesn\u2019t have enough to go around or it\u2019s, you know, potentially, the experience that you had, where you went to change your password and you couldn\u2019t access your account, right? That\u2019s not a resilient operation.\u201c[It\u2019s] prioritizing resilience and doing more \u201cWhat if\u201d or tabletop exercises as they\u2019re sometimes called, so that you don\u2019t have a negative impact on brand and reputation, customer loyalty or revenue streams, is really a big focus for the folks that we work with. \u2014Interos CEO Jennifer BisceglieTo hear her thoughts on how to build corporate resilience, along with what\u2019s next for T-Mobile and its customers, you can download the podcast here, listen to the episode below, or scroll down to read a lightly edited transcript.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Lightly Edited Transcript(Editor\u2019s note: Here\u2019s a link to the cost of phishing report mentioned in the podcast.)Lisa Vaas: My guest today is Jennifer Bisceglie, founder and CEO of Interos, a company that offers a SaaS platform that uses artificial intelligence to model business ecosystems into a living global map down to any single supplier, thus, hopefully helping them to avoid situations like the one T-Mobile found itself in this weekend.Jennifer, welcome to the Threatpost podcast.Jennifer Bisceglie: Thanks for having me, Lisa.Lisa Vaas: Absolutely. So Jennifer, let me just jump right into the T-Mobile situation. I mean, as TechCrunch has pointed out, they enumerated how many cybersecurity blunders that T-Mobile has gotten: into: blunders or unfortunate incidents.What does it say about T-Mobile\u2019s security profile and incidents response that this would be the fifth breach over the last three years?Jennifer Bisceglie: I can\u2019t speak specifically on T-Mobile\u2019s security profile.I think that a couple things one, if you read the paper, as I\u2019m sure your listeners do, this is, you know, cyber attacks are simply on the rise and that major telecommunication providers are definitely one of the areas that the bad guys focus on as are other areas of the critical infrastructure. And so I think there\u2019s an opportunity for improvement, but it\u2019s definitely an area that I think that the world\u2019s getting used to. We are so hyper-connected digitally that we really have to understand who we\u2019re connected to at any point in time. And that\u2019s really understanding your business partners and their business partners, which is a different cultural shift than most people have thought about in the past.Lisa Vaas: Well, when you talk about business suppliers I assume we\u2019re talking about things like insider risks or even just an inadvertent misconfiguration, somewhere along the supply chain, when it comes to suppliers, do you want to expound on that?Jennifer Bisceglie: Sure. So we look at business partners through three lenses. If you will. We look at, you know, kind of the physical supply chains. So those business partners or suppliers or customers that you\u2019re trading physical widgets with, you look at digital. So those that you have electronic connections to, and then you look at services or the people.And so, you know, if you think about insider threats, that would kind of be the third around services or the people. So who has access to my stuff. And is that a good or a bad thing from a hands-on? Versus just folks that have digital connections, like cloud providers for point of sale systems or any sort of electronic connection.To the point of what I said a minute ago in your question, because we are also digitally connected or electronically connected this world of cybersecurity. The conversation has expanded from simply the companies that, you know, you\u2019re doing business with to all of the companies that those companies are doing business with.And so on. So the, the unknown risk and the unknown connections are often where the problems and the vulnerabilities are.Lisa Vaas: Right. Well I know you guys provide as I said, a global map to kind of suss out, down to the individual supplier, who those are. But what do you think about T-Mobile? What is next for the company and its customers?Jennifer Bisceglie: Well, I think the first thing is just locking down exactly what was stolen and, and and if there\u2019s a continued vulnerability that\u2019s exposed right now or where the potential next one is. And so I think you\u2019re going to see what we normally see in this situation is a heightened sense of security.And you know, another fresh look at patching to make sure that there isn\u2019t, you know, as little porous of a situation as there can be. This isn\u2019t just T-Mobile. I think you\u2019re going to see it across the telecom industry because, you know, it\u2019s a very, very small world that we live in.Nobody wants to be the next one. So I think you\u2019re going to see a heightened sense of security across the industry.Lisa Vaas: Well, that would be good, but the breaches keep coming. So I don\u2019t know what exactly that\u2019s going to mean. I mean, people are gonna suddenly start paying attention to patching, like they weren\u2019t before, or something?.Jennifer Bisceglie: I don\u2019t know that they weren\u2019t paying attention to it. I think they\u2019re going to, it\u2019s more of an expanse approach to it. I also think that unfortunately, we live in a world and as I mentioned that we are digitally connected to each other, and it\u2019s hard for anyone to be at 100 percent constantly.Trying to figure out how to preempt or be proactive with some of these things so that it\u2019s not if you get breached, but when you get breached, there are protections and fences that you can put in place is going to be really important. Segmentation of data that\u2019s housed in-house is also going to be important.So making sure that the crown jewels are just not in one single location. So if that location is breached, you can suck it all out is, is another way. So like containerizing data would be another way to kind of patch something. So I think there\u2019s going to be, my expectation, having not spoken with any of them, is there\u2019s going to be a hard look at how we\u2019re housing, you know PII or personal data.That\u2019s valuable to make sure that if the next third, when the next breach happens, that they can\u2019t be hit all of once.Lisa Vaas: Even T-Mobile, multiple servers were involved in this breach according to the seller who\u2019s trying to offload the 30 million customer subset of the 100 million uber set.They\u2019ve got the Oracle customer relationship database. I know that there were multiple other servers, but that seemed like the crown jewels right there, the customer relationship management database. And how do you segment a database like that?Jennifer Bisceglie: To me, I think to your point, is it different servers, different containers? There\u2019s lots of different technologies that, you know, can separate these things. I know we do the same thing here at Interos, making sure that, you know, it\u2019s very difficult.And again, it\u2019s, it\u2019s we always look at this as, when, not if, we all get there. And it\u2019s very difficult to take everything all at once. You know, we did a survey, Lisa, that talked about, you know, the physical disruption of these types of reaches could be anywhere from $184 million a year. If you actually look at it from a loss, from a profitability, as well as just the brand and reputational harm.And so, you know, as far as the technology solutions, there, there are several out there. But you know, if you look at should the money and the time be spent to protect yourselves, I think that the dollars speak for themselves.Lisa Vaas: Yeah. Proofpoint just came out with a report about the true costs of phishing, which will often lead to business email compromise and ransomware, of course.And it was interesting to hear them say that, when you think about ransomware, for example, the actual extortion payment itself only accounts for in, in general, on average, 20% of the entire costs, and productivity loss was just a huge part of the pie. So yeah, I definitely hear you on that, never mind the whole mopping up, fixing issues, investigations, all that jazz. Well, let\u2019s talk about how this breach I mean, we don\u2019t even know yet. I guess as of yesterday, we didn\u2019t know, they hadn\u2019t verified. T-Mobile had not verified these are actual customer records that were involved.I would not be surprised if they were, but probably nobody would be. But if, if this breach, does turned out to be the worst possible case, which is the loss of all of that personally identifiable information along with even the security PINs and Social Security numbers and on and on and on, how is that going to affect T-Mobile? How is it going to affect their customer base and their reputation?Jennifer Bisceglie: Yeah, I think it really, it really depends on what they choose to do from here. And so I think it\u2019s been proven over the years that a breach isn\u2019t always the end of the world, especially if the company can demonstrate a good-faith effort to protect and potentially, you know, monitor the affected consumers as best they can and take measures to increase the operational resilience and cybersecurity.I think that over the last year and a half to two years, based on world events, Lisa, that this, this world of interconnectivity became very, very personal. And so I always tell people like for the first time ever, my mother understands what we do for a living because they couldn\u2019t read, they couldn\u2019t get access to paper towels or cleaning supplies with the pandemic.And most recently, I couldn\u2019t drive for two days because of the breach of the gas line on the east coast. So I think that whether the breach turns out to be significant or not, so much of this is happening at the brand and reputational level, and it\u2019s being played out in the court of public opinion.And at the same time, these breaches are happening so rapidly that there is some level of desensitization that\u2019s happening with the general public as well. And so, you know, I think again, I think a lot of it\u2019s what T-Mobile, or the whole industry, does from here, you know, as they go forward. But I, I do think that, you know, Joe public really understands that this is part of life and it really just depends on how they operate and you know, how their leadership comes out from, from what next steps are.Lisa Vaas: As a T-Mobile customer myself, I would like to hear what you think a good-faith effort would be. I know it\u2019s premature for them to reach out, to affected customers if they don\u2019t even know that customers have been affected. But yeah, I was really scurrying when I heard this news, to change my password. And fortunately, I already had multifactor authentication enabled, et cetera, et cetera. But at one point I was trying to change my password online and I wasn\u2019t able to. I don\u2019t remember what the error message was. Something like a 404, can\u2019t complete your request at this time.Maybe it was just my connection, but I don\u2019t know, boy, I wasn\u2019t reassured.Jennifer Bisceglie: The great news with what you just said, though, Lisa, to look at the bright side is, you know, there\u2019s been statistics, something around 60 to 70 percent of cybersecurity is around what they call hygiene, which is exactly what you just talked about.It\u2019s updating your password. It\u2019s multiple factor authentication. It\u2019s these things that five years ago, I don\u2019t know that we would have used in a sentence. So how powerful was what you just said versus saying I wanted to change and go to Verizon. Right. And I think that that\u2019s really, when I talk about the desensitizing of kind of the Joe public it\u2019s that we realized that we all have a role in cybersecurity and understanding that there are certain things that are within our power.Changing our passwords, like multifactor identification sign-up that actually helped to protect us on our own data that actually helps the companies that we put our trust into. And I think that\u2019s really a great news story.Lisa Vaas: Yeah, that is a very good point. But you know, as somebody who gets completely ignored by loved ones when I try to preach the benefits of multifactor authentication, I don\u2019t know what to do with that insight. The onus is on individuals, but they don\u2019t seem particularly eager to adopt these practices.Well, anyway, you said earlier, In our discussions over email, that T-Mobile should prioritize corporate resilience before it\u2019s too late. Cybersecurity writers love the phrase \u201ctoo late.\u201d I was like, oh, what does that look like? What would too late look like? And while you\u2019re at it, maybe we can define corporate resilience.Jennifer Bisceglie: Yeah, so corporate or what we call operational resilience is, literally, we consider that the ability for the organization to continue operations or service in the face of a variety of shocks, which includes everything from cyber attacks like we\u2019re talking to, or, you know, we work with customers dealing with natural disasters to pandemics.And so really it\u2019s just making sure that operations can continue. And we talk about prioritizing. Too late it\u2019s things like this, right. It\u2019s things like what we saw at the pandemic where Apple came out, very public and missed their earnings. It\u2019s when the Suez Canal, the ship got stuck and people didn\u2019t know if they had alternative sources for the demand, it\u2019s the semiconductor industry that doesn\u2019t have enough to go around or it\u2019s, you know, potentially, the experience that you had, where you went to change your password and you couldn\u2019t access your account, right? That\u2019s not a resilient operation. [It\u2019s] prioritizing resilience and doing more \u201cWhat if\u201d or tabletop exercises as they\u2019re sometimes called, so that you don\u2019t have a negative impact on brand and reputation, customer loyalty or revenue streams, is really a big focus for the folks that we work with.Lisa Vaas: Okay, fair enough. We\u2019re coming up against our time limit here. So Jen, can I ask you for any parting thoughts for T-Mobile or for other companies that might be, wisely, fearing a similar situation?Jennifer Bisceglie: The first thing is, as I shared in the very beginning, it\u2019s not an if, it\u2019s a when. And so really focusing on the future of having solid corporate or operational resilience and having that visibility into your internal and external ecosystem before the disruption begins is really a powerful place to be so that when you do get hit, because most of us will in some level, you actually have an answer.You didn\u2019t go out to the public and say, you can continue to partner with us to trust in us because we\u2019re investing in ourselves and investing in your safety and your education. And I think that\u2019s, you know, if we were to wish anybody that, you know, leading today, it\u2019s really having proactive, operational resilience, we believe wins the day.Lisa Vaas: Yeah, totally. I I love it. That\u2019s a great final thought. And you know, it certainly expands the whole, \u201cWe take seriously your security\u201d clich\u00e9 that we often hear. There\u2019s got to be some more nuance to it than that. Well, Jen, thank you so much. It\u2019s been a real pleasure to have you. Thank you.BreachCloud SecurityMobile SecurityPodcasts",

        "raw text": "T-Mobile has confirmed much of what a threat actor bragged about over the weekend: Personal details for tens of millions of current, former or prospective T-Mobile customers were stolen in a huge breach of its servers.On Tuesday, it disclosed further details on the data breach in a post on its website, saying that the breach affects as many as 7.8 million postpaid subscribers, 850,000 prepaid customers and \u201cjust over\u201d 40 million past or prospective customers who\u2019ve applied for credit with T-Mobile.Its investigation is ongoing, but so far, it doesn\u2019t look like financial data, credit card information, debit or other payment information was in the stolen files, T-Mobile said. The wireless carrier said that it located and \u201cimmediately\u201d closed the access point in its servers that it believes granted access to the attacker(s).Forrester Analyst Allie Mellen told Threatpost on Wednesday that this attack wasn\u2019t exactly rocket science.\u00a0 \u201cAccording to the attackers, this was a configuration issue on an access point T-Mobile used for testing,\u201d she said via email. \u201cThe configuration issue made this access point publicly available on the Internet. This was not a sophisticated attack; this was not a zero day. T-Mobile left a gate left wide open for attackers \u2013 and attackers just had to find the gate.\u201dAt least according to what the purported thief told cybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble, the threat actor made off with a collection of databases that total about 106GB of data, including T-Mobile\u2019s Oracle customer relationship management (CRM) database.Compromised payment data may not have shown up in T-Mobile\u2019s investigation, but personal information did: As of 01:54 Wednesday morning, T-Mobile had ascertained that the ripped-off data included customers\u2019 first and last names, date of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver\u2019s license/ID information \u201cfor a subset of current and former postpay customers and prospective T-Mobile customers.\u201dThe telecommunications bigwig said that it first learned late last week about claims, posted to an underground forum, that threat actor(s) had stolen over 100 million customer records and were offering 30 million for sale for the surprisingly cheap cost of 6 bitcoin (~$270,000), or about 1 cent per record.According to preliminary analysis, about 7.8 million current T-Mobile postpaid customer accounts\u2019 information were in the stolen files, plus over 40 million records of former or prospective customers who had previously applied for credit with T-Mobile.Either the purported thief was lying about also getting at phone numbers, account numbers, security PINs, and passwords, or T-Mobile\u2019s preliminary investigations haven\u2019t yet revealed proof that they were. At any rate, the company said that none of those, nor financial information, were compromised in any of the purloined files of customers or prospective customers.Over the weekend, the threat actor who was offering to sell the records on an underground forum told BleepingComputer and Motherboard that they\u2019d also stolen physical addresses, unique IMEI numbers and IMSI numbers. The attacker told BleepingComputer that T-Mobile\u2019s \u201centire IMEI history database going back to 2004 was stolen.\u201d IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique 15-digit code that precisely identifies a mobile device with the SIM card input, and an IMSI (International mobile subscriber identity) is a unique number that identifies every user of a cellular network.No phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were compromised in any of the stolen records pertaining to customers or prospective customers, Not so for prepaid customers, though: There were, in fact, security PINs for 850,000 prepaid customers involved, T-Mobile said in its update: \u201cAt this time, we have also been able to confirm approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customer names, phone numbers and account PINs were also exposed.\u201dIt\u2019s reset all the PINs on the prepaid accounts and plans to notify customers \u201cright away,\u201d the company said. No Metro by T-Mobile, former Sprint prepaid, or Boost customers had their names or PINs exposed.Finally, information from inactive prepaid accounts was compromised through prepaid billing files. There were no customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information or Social Security numbers contained in the inactive file.Free Two Years Identity ProtectionT-Mobile plans to contact customers \u201cshortly\u201d to let them know that it\u2019s immediately offering two years of free identity protection services with McAfee\u2019s ID Theft Protection Service. What else it plans to outline:Recommending all T-Mobile postpaid customers proactively change their PIN by going online into their T-Mobile account or calling our Customer Care team by dialing 611 on your phone. This precaution is despite the fact that we have no knowledge that any postpaid account PINs were compromised.Offering an extra step to protect your mobile account with our Account Takeover Protection capabilities for postpaid customers, which makes it harder for customer accounts to be fraudulently ported out and stolen.Publishing a unique web page later on Wednesday for one stop information and solutions to help customers take steps to further protect themselvesStay tuned, the company said: The investigation continues, and T-Mobile \u201cmay learn additional facts through our investigation that cause the details above to change or evolve.\u201dSome observers aren\u2019t exactly impressed by the standard-issue \u201csecurity is super important to us\u201d messaging and the offloading of responsibility to customers.\u00a0\u201cT-Mobile is offering two free years of identity protection for affected customers, but ultimately this is pushing the responsibility for the safety of the data onto the user,\u201d Mellen told Threatpost. \u201cInstead of addressing the security gaps that have plagued T-Mobile for years, they are offering their customers temporary identity protection when breaches happen, as if to say, \u2018This is the best we can do.'\u201dSomebody\u2019s Flunking at HistoryIf this is the best T-Mobile can do, that\u2019s a sad statement. This is at least the fifth time that T-Mobile has been attacked in recent years.The roster of breaches:January 2021: The wireless carrier disclosed that it detected and shut down \u201cmalicious, unauthorized access to some information\u201d related to T-Mobile accounts. Specifically, that data consisted of customer proprietary network information (CPNI) \u2013 a data set that the FCC calls \u201csome of the most sensitive personal information that carriers and providers have about their customers.\u201dCPNI includes records of which phone numbers users called; the frequency, duration, and timing of such calls; and any services purchased by the consumer, such as call waiting. T-Mobile said that the thieves in this case lifted phone numbers, number of lines subscribed to on accounts, \u201cand, in some cases, call-related information.\u201d2018: 2.3 million subscribers\u2019 data were exposed, including names, billing ZIP codes, phone numbers, email addresses, account numbers and account types (prepaid or postpaid).2019: about 1.26 million of T-Mobile\u2019s prepaid were affected by a breach that included names, billing addresses (if provided), phone numbers, account numbers and CPNI.2020: An undetermined number of employees and customers were affected when attackers accessed employee email accounts, some of which contained account information for T-Mobile customers, including names and addresses, phone numbers, account numbers and more.While this is the fifth breach since 2018, it\u2019s \u201cby far\u201d the biggest and the baddest, Mellen observed, meaning that somebody isn\u2019t learning their cybersecurity lessons. \u201cThis is the fifth public data breach of T-Mobile in three or four years, and by far leaks the most sensitive data and exposes the most customers,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems T-Mobile has not learned from these previous breaches, especially considering they didn\u2019t know about the attack until the attackers posted about it in an online forum.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.BreachNewsWeb Security",

The collection is a subset of the purported 100 million records contained in stolen databases.The seller told Motherboard \u2013 which first reported the news \u2013 that for now, they\u2019re privately selling the rest.The seller also told Alon Gal, CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, that this sucker-punch to US infrastructure was done in retaliation, as Gal tweeted on Sunday: \u201cThis breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019,\u201d the threat actor told Gal. \u201cWe did it to harm US infrastructure.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1426923538099970050Binns is a US citizen who lives in Turkey and who sued the FBI, CIA and Department of Justice in 2020, alleging that he was tortured and harassed by the US and Turkish governments and is seeking to compel the USA to release documents regarding these activities under the Freedom of Information Act.The seller\u2019s offer doesn\u2019t mention T-Mobile, but the seller told Motherboard and BleepingComputer that the source is in fact the telecommunication kingpin\u2019s servers. Specifically, they claim to have penetrated T-Mobile\u2019s production, staging, and development servers two weeks ago, including an Oracle database server that held the customer data, according to what they told BleepingComputer.As proof of the theft, the threat actor shared with BleepingComputer a screenshot of an SSH connection to a production server running Oracle.081621 13:50 UPDATE: On Monday morning, T-Mobile told news outlets that it\u2019s investigating the alleged data breach, which first came to light on an underground forum over the weekend. On Monday afternoon, the company confirmed to Threatpost that it has determined that there\u2019s been unauthorized access to \u201csome T-Mobile data,\u201d though it didn\u2019t answer questions about the scope of the breach.T-Mobile hasn\u2019t\u00a0 yet determined whether personal customer data was involved but said that it was \u201cconfident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed,\u201d confirming the threat actor\u2019s claim that the telecom giant had closed down whatever backdoor they\u2019d crawled through. T-Mobile also said that a \u201cdeep technical review of the situation\u201d across its systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed is currently ongoing.\u201cThis investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cUntil we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.\u201dThe company said that it\u2019s working with law enforcement on the incident. Its full statement is included below.Even if T-Mobile hasn\u2019t yet confirmed that their personal data was involved in the breach, T-Mobile customers would be well-advised to change their security PINs, given the laundry list of details that were purportedly exposed. The seller told BleepingComputer that the records contain:Social Security numbersPhone numbersNamesSecurity PINsPhysical addressesUnique IMEI numbersIMSI numbersDriver license numbersDates of birthThe attacker told BleepingComputer that T-Mobile\u2019s \u201centire IMEI history database going back to 2004 was stolen.\u201d IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) is a unique 15-digit code that precisely identifies a mobile device with the SIM card input, and an IMSI (International mobile subscriber identity) is a unique number that identifies every user of a cellular network.Fresh Baked, and Such a BargainThe asking price for the 30m records is six bitcoin, which was worth about $280,000 as of Monday morning East Coast time.BleepingComputer posted a screenshot of the forum post, which claimed that the records are \u201cFreshly dumped and NEVER sold before!\u201d It added that \u201cSERIOUS BUYERS ONLY!\u201d should inquire.Forum post. Source: BleepingComputer.Motherboard\u2019s Joseph Cox has seen samples of the data and confirmed that it\u2019s accurate information belonging to T-Mobile customers. In short, the records contain \u201cFull customer info\u201d for T-Mobile USA customers, the threat actor told Motherboard in an online chat.T-Mobile has apparently responded by turning off the leaky faucet(s): The seller told Motherboard that they\u2019ve \u201clost access to the backdoored servers.\u201dNo matter, the purported thief said: They already made backups \u201cin multiple places.\u201dCybersecurity intelligence firm Cyble told BleepingComputer that the threat actor claims that they obtained several databases, totaling approximately 106GB of data, including T-Mobile\u2019s customer relationship management (CRM) database.A Penny Per PersonThe asking price is crazy cheap, one expert told Threatpost: It comes out to about a penny per purported victim. That\u2019s quite a bargain for cybercrooks, given that the records are rich in data that can be used to conduct \u201d targeted mobile attacks, social engineering, sophisticated phishing campaigns or financial fraud.\u201dIlia Kolochenko, founder of the Swiss app sec firm ImmuniWeb and a member of the Europol Data Protection Experts Network, told Threatpost that what\u2019s even worse is that the records reportedly encompass data from 2004 to 2021 and \u201ccan cause extreme invasion of privacy or be used for blackmailing of wealthy victims.\u201cGiven that the offer seems to be new and unique, the price is very cheap: just 1 cent per victim. The records, which allegedly contain such extremely sensitive data as social security numbers and full histories of mobile phone usage, can be exploited to conduct targeted mobile attacks, social engineering, sophisticated phishing campaigns or financial fraud,\u201d Kolochenko said via email.Kolochenko thinks it\u2019s \u201cpretty likely\u201d that one of T-Mobile\u2019s suppliers could have unwittingly facilitated or caused the data breach, \u201cBased on the available technical information.\u201d\u201cIf so, it will be another grim reminder about the importance of Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) programs and risk-based vendor vetting,\u201d he noted.T-Mobile could be in for a world of legal hurt if the breach is confirmed, Kolochenko predicted. \u201cT-Mobile may face an avalanche of individual and class action lawsuits from the victims, as well as protracted investigations and serious monetary penalties from the states where the victims are based.Nonetheless, it\u2019s too early to freak out, Kolochenko advised: \u201cIt would be premature to make conclusions before T-Mobile makes an official statement on the quantity and nature of the stolen data. The potential victims should refrain from panic and contact T-Mobile asking what type of intermediary support and compensation may be provided while the investigation is in progress. Some remediate actions, such as changing your driving license, may be time-consuming and costly, and I\u2019d not precipitate here unless T-Mobile undertakes to cover the costs or confirm that the information was actually stolen.\u201dOne of the Year\u2019s Biggest BreachesIf T-Mobile was in fact breached, and if 100 million customers\u2019 data was in fact involved, it won\u2019t be the biggest breach so far this year. It\u2019s outdone by the LinkedIn breach in June, in which 700 million users\u2019 data was posted for sale on the underground.Still, it\u2019s up there.Jack Chapman, vice president of threat intelligence at Egress, told Threatpost on Monday that the threat to T-Mobile is high. \u201cThe data leaked in this breach is reported as being already accessible to cybercriminals, who could now weaponize it to formulate sophisticated phishing attacks targeting the victims,\u201d Chapman said in an email.He advised affected customers to be wary of \u201cany unexpected communications they might now receive, whether that\u2019s over email, text messages or phone calls. Follow-up attacks may utilize the information accessed through this data breach to trick people into sharing more personal data that can be used for identity and financial fraud.\u201dChapman added that the incident \u201chighlights the need for organizations such as T-Mobile to put in place the right technology to secure their sensitive data and defend their employees and their company from targeted attacks by cybercriminals. It\u2019s time for organizations to take responsibility and ensure they\u2019re keeping their customers\u2019 data out of the hands of cybercriminals.\u201dUPDATE: Breach Confirmed, T-Mobile Works \u2018Around the Clock\u2019 on Investigation081621 15:48 UPDATE: T-Mobile provided the following statement to Threatpost:\u201cWe have been working around the clock to investigate claims being made that T-Mobile data may have been illegally accessed. We take the protection of our customers very seriously and we are conducting an extensive analysis alongside digital forensic experts to understand the validity of these claims, and we are coordinating with law enforcement.\u201cWe have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data occurred, however we have not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved. We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed. This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.\u201cWe understand that customers will have questions and concerns, and resolving those is critically important to us. Once we have a more complete and verified understanding of what occurred, we will proactively communicate with our customers and other stakeholders.\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "As 5G private networks roll out in the coming years, security may be a key issue for enterprises. A survey released at Mobile World Congress on Monday shows that major gaps persist in security capabilities among mobile operators.Some 68 percent of operators already sell private wireless networks to enterprise customers, with the rest planning to do so by 2025, according to the study, from the GSMA and Trend Micro. However, from a security perspective, these may not be ready for prime time: 41 percent of surveyed operators said they face challenges when it comes to solving vulnerabilities related to 5G\u2019s network virtualization, for instance.Also, 48 percent of them said they don\u2019t have enough internal knowledge or tools to discover and solve security vulnerabilities at all. A contributing factor to the problem is a limited pool of mobile-network security experts for 39 percent of surveyed operators.5G Networks: Different Architecture, Different Risks5G networks represent a sea change from prior wireless networks in that they are largely software-defined and virtualized. Network functions, historically defined in hardware, become virtual software capabilities in 5G, all orchestrated via a flexible software control plane. Even the air interfaces in the radio access network (RAN) are software-defined in 5G.The problem is that this raises the possibility for rafts of exploitable vulnerabilities to emerge throughout the architecture\u00a0in places that were never exposed before.\u201cBecause so much of the environment is virtualized, there will be a lot of software creating images and tearing them down \u2013 the volume of virtualization is unlike anything we have experienced so far,\u201d William Malik, vice president of infrastructure strategies at Trend Micro, told Threatpost. \u201cThe risk there is that we do not know how well the software will perform under such huge loads. Every experience with distributed software under load suggests that things will fail, services will drop and any vulnerability will be wide open for exploitation.\u201d The stakes are higher, too. When it comes to 5G, it\u2019s faster and has lower latency than earlier generations of wireless networks and will support a range of next-gen applications, including smart-factory installations, smart cities, autonomous vehicles, tele-surgery, advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence, among others. As such, 5G private networks will roll out in a variety of settings, including factories, where they\u2019ll connect sensors and a range of industrial internet of things (IoT) devices; hospital and educational campuses; stadiums; industrial locations such as mines, ports and oil rigs; and to support public-safety applications.\u201cThese networks will manage complex factories, distribution centers and logistics operations,\u201d said Malik. \u201cThink about the traffic at a major port \u2013 much of the work is not done by individuals but by application software coordinated by scheduling and orchestration software. If you can take this over, you can dump containers into Long Beach Harbor, or ship 2,000 pounds of Cream O\u2019 Wheat to your neighbor. In the port of Amsterdam, the bad guys took over the scheduling software and actually had containers full of guns, drugs, and in some cases criminals, delivered without inspection into the port then smuggled onwards throughout Europe.\u201dAnd, instead of sending all data to a cloud for processing, 5G uses multi-access edge computing (MEC), which means that the network edge analyzes, processes and stores the data generated from endpoints. Collecting and processing data closer to the customer reduces latency and brings real-time performance to high-bandwidth applications, but it also presents a new footprint to secure, with new data pools scattered around the network.\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on corporate 5G implementations, generally called NPN \u2013 non-public networks. In these environments the 5G signal is restricted to a specific area \u2013 a port, a distribution center, a manufacturing facility \u2013 so we don\u2019t have random devices connecting, and every application and device can be authenticated (note that this is not an architectural requirement but it is a really good idea),\u201d Malik said. \u201cEven with that, the 5G network will be a very efficient way to move data around the site, so if malware gets into something, it will spread fast.\u201dThe survey found that half (51 percent) of the operators reported that MEC is a key part of their strategy for addressing enterprises\u2019 private network needs within the next two years. Yet only 18 percent of surveyed operators offer security for both the edge and endpoints.Best Practices for 5G Private Network Security\u201cThe bad guys will try to take over the 5G network by either sneaking some rogue software into the mix, using a supply-chain attack like SolarWinds; or sneaking past authentication to launch their own processes that can cryptomine (stealing resources), exfiltrate data or set off a ransomware attack,\u201d Malik said.Even though security capabilities are lagging for now, nearly half (45 percent) of operators in the survey said they consider it extremely important to invest in security to achieve their long-term enterprise revenue goals \u2013 compared with just 22 percent in 2020.A full 44 percent of operators said they have seen increased growth in demand for security services from their enterprise clients due to COVID-19, while 77 percent of operators look to security as a top opportunity for revenue generation, forecasting that 20 percent of 5G revenue will come from security add-on services.The 3GPP, the standards body in charge of wireless network specifications, has built some security controls into the 5G spec:There\u2019s more that carriers can do, however, to help differentiate their offerings, according to Malik.\u201cBest practices for securing these NPN environments would include authenticating everything and everyone \u2013 that\u2019s the idea behind zero trust,\u201d Malik told Threatpost. \u201cYou have to prove you are who you say you are before you can do anything on the network.\u201dIt\u2019s also a good idea to log and audit message traffic and to use tools to note when lots of data seems to be flowing where it shouldn\u2019t, he added.\u201cAlso, use tools to detect processes that are misbehaving \u2013 like a process that starts encrypting everything it can touch,\u201d according to Malik. \u201cTo help recover from an attack, take frequent backups and make sure they are valid. Also, buy technology from trusted vendors and use reliable integrators to hook things up.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET\u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "An Elasticsearch server holding personal data of 6 million players of the popular mobile game Battle for the Galaxy was discovered insecure and containing over 1 terabyte of unencrypted data, meaning anyone with a link could access data stored on the repository.Ethical hackers WizCase found the data and quickly alerted AMT Games, the publisher of Battle of the Galaxy, that the customer data was exposed. According to WizCase, AMT Games has not responded to inquiries, but the leaky server is now secure.\nBattle for the Galaxy is available for Android and iOS devices, via the Steam gaming platform and also through the game publisher\u2019s browser-based version of the game. The game follows the open world format, allowing players build worlds and armies that can be directed to battle other user armies.A Galaxy of Open DataWizCase said, in all 1.47 terabytes of data was left vulnerable. The stockpile included 5.9 million player profiles, 2 million transactions and 587,000 feedback messages. Feedback massages included account IDs, email addresses, in-game purchase prices and payment providers. Pulled together, this database could provide a rich set of data for cybercriminals to hone their phishing emails to make them look legitimate, WizCase said.\u201cFor example, with the email addresses and specific details of user issues with the service such as in transactions and developer messages could allow bad actors to pose as game support and direct users to malicious websites where their credit card details can be stolen,\u201d WizCase said.\u201cWith data on how much money has been spent per account, these conmen could target the highest-paying users, many of whom are children judging by their game history, time spent in game, circle of friends in-game, etc. and have an even higher chance of success than they would otherwise,\u201d according to the WizCase report published Wednesday.Less Than 1 Percent of Players Generate 90 Percent of EarningsInterestingly, an analysis of Battle for the Galaxy player transaction data by WizCase showed only .33 percent of the users in the sample were responsible for 90 percent of the income earned off all the total transactions. This tiny fraction of players accounting for most of the game\u2019s business indicated to WizeCase that the game is aggressively profiting on a minority of users.\u201cWhile we cannot comment on if\u00a0Battle for the Galaxy\u00a0specifically uses predatory business practices,\u00a0these practices, especially loot boxes, are common in the bulk of free-to-play mobile games as well as console/PC games, like\u00a0Overwatch,\u00a0League of Legends, and\u00a0Fortnite. Fortnite\u2019s practices were so egregious that its publisher, Epic Games, was\u00a0sued\u00a0in 2019 and settled by giving away 1,000 of its in-game V-Bucks currency to claimants. Fortnite discontinued its loot box practices in 2019, revealing what users would be getting in the game\u2019s Loot Llamas before purchase,\u201d WizCase wrote.Gamers BewareThreatpost contacted AMT Games and is waiting for a reply regarding questions about the WizCase report and allegations. AMT Games Facebook page said its development offices are in Russia. WizCase identified the corporate headquarters were based in China.In April, Call of Duty \u201cWar Zone\u201d was used as cover for scammers peddling fake game cheats to deliver malware. Blockbuster game Resident Evil suffered a major data breach in January of this year, exposing the data of as many as 400,000 players. And of course, the Cyberpunk 2077 release was plagued by attacks. Even the kids are under siege. Last October, the game Among Us was temporarily shut down by an attacker named Eris Loris who spammed players until the game was unplayable.\u201cWe recommend always inputting the bare minimum of information when making a purchase or setting up an account on the internet,\u201d WizCase advised. \u201cThe less information you give hackers to work with, the less vulnerable you are to attack.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cA Walk On The Dark Side: A Pipeline Cyber Crisis Simulation\u201d\u2013 a LIVE interactive demo on\u00a0Wed, June 9 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "After embarking on a second unforeseen year of mass remote work, everyone is now accessing corporate resources through the cloud. To help enable this, organizations are introducing new technologies into their standard workflows. The COVID-19 pandemic presented a new realm of unmarked territory as businesses quickly, and almost haphazardly, shifted all employees offsite. Corporate networks were unprepared to handle this new caliber of remote access, and significant security gaps were created along the way. But, organizational and individual data access to corporate and personal information began to evolve long before the pandemic.We want access to anything, from anywhere, on any device. To securely enable that desire, security teams already needed visibility into every device that accessed their corporate infrastructure and data. However, the pandemic catapulted this need to the top of every business leader\u2019s mind, and the ability to block unhealthy devices that put an organization\u2019s security at risk has never been more necessary. Now, with operations shifting almost entirely to the cloud for many, mobile workers have access to much more than just email. This access, however, comes with significant risks.Zero trust, which is rooted in the idea that no device is secure until proven otherwise, has become a widely accepted technical framework as businesses strive to monitor and maintain networks\u2019 health with widely distributed endpoints. This philosophy should be applied to any device that interacts with your network, the most precarious of which are our mobile phones and tablets. With work increasingly being conducted outside the reach of legacy perimeter systems, there is no effective way to determine who or what device you can trust.To implement an effective zero-trust strategy, organizations must first accept three key factors:Your network is now in every home officeLegacy and traditional security technologies do not apply.Mobile devices cannot be trusted.\u00a0Zero Trust and Personal DevicesBring your own device (BYOD) is another factor of remote work triggered long before COVID-19 uprooted the global workforce. In fact, Gartner predicted in 2018 that at least \u201c80 percent of worker tasks\u201d would shift to mobile devices by 2020. As this shift took place, mobile users and the organizations that support them must become acutely aware of the added risks posed by reliance on their smartphones and tablets.The mobile device that an employee uses to access their corporate data in platforms such as Google Workspace or Office 365 might be used later to browse social media or download a new app for personal use. These actions present new opportunities for the employee to be phished or introduce malware into their network. Many consumer-focused applications can be easily compromised, leaving the user\u2019s data, and the corporate data they access from that same device, exposed. A robust approach to combating this risk is to deploy a zero-trust security model.Zero Trust and Cloud SecurityAt this point, most organizations are embracing the benefits of cloud services to better enable the workforce and modernize their infrastructure. In doing so, they\u2019re also enabling access to sensitive data from any device regardless of whether they manage it or not. This paradigm shift means legacy security strategies that rely on securing the four walls of the office are aging out, and security and mobility teams need to modernize their security strategy to include mobile zero trust if they want to keep up.Embracing Zero TrustMobile devices are the cornerstone of what makes remote work so practical. They also present a new challenge to security teams that haven\u2019t modernized their security strategy to include mobile devices. Since traditional perimeter security is outdated, security teams must move their critical functions to the mobile endpoint and secure data from wherever it is accessed. Zero trust strengthens and modernizes endpoint security by ensuring any device with access to corporate information is routinely evaluated for risk before being trusted. Mobile needs to be part of that.Hank Schless, is senior security solutions manager at Lookout.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cloud SecurityInfoSec InsiderMobile Security",

        "raw text": "Mobile device-tracking by Apple and Google take center stage in a report revealing that, despite both allowing users to opt out of sharing telemetry data \u2013 they do anyway.\u201cBoth iOS and Google Android transmit telemetry, despite the user explicitly opting out of this,\u201d wrote researcher Douglas Leith from Trinity College in Ireland, in a recently published academic report.The research, entitled Mobile Handset Privacy: Measuring The Data iOS and Android Send to Apple And Google (PDF), also found that Google collects up to 20 times more data from its Android Pixel users compared to the amount of data that Apple collects from iOS users.\n\u201cThe phone IMEI, hardware serial number, SIM serial number and IMSI, handset phone number etc. are shared with Apple and Google,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWhen a SIM is inserted, both iOS and Google Android send details to Apple/Google. iOS sends the MAC addresses of nearby devices, e.g. other handsets and the home gateway, to Apple, together with their GPS location. Currently there are few, if any, realistic options for preventing this data sharing.\u201dData Collected & Shared with Apple, Google Parameters of the testing did not include pre-installed apps baked into the manufacturers\u2019 mobile operating system, or third-party apps. Rather, research focused on data collected by OS-level handset components and functions, such as Apple\u2019s Bluetooth UniqueChipID, Secure Element ID and the transmission of the devices\u2019 Wi-Fi MAC addresses.\u201cGoogle collects a notably larger volume of handset data than Apple,\u201d Leith wrote. \u201cDuring the first 10 minutes of startup, the Pixel handset sends around 1MB of data to Google, compared with the iPhone sending around 42KB of data to Apple. When the handsets are sitting idle, the Pixel sends roughly 1MB of data to Google every 12 hours, compared with the iPhone sending 52KB to Apple \u2014 i.e., Google collects around 20 times more handset data than Apple.\u201dHe noted that the operating systems connect to their back-end servers on average every 4.5 minutes, whether they\u2019re in use or not.On an informal basis, Leith did examine a number of the pre-installed apps and services, specific to the phone manufacturers. He noted that they also make network connections, despite never having been opened or used.\u201cIn particular, on iOS these include Siri, Safari and iCloud; and on Google Android these include the YouTube app, Chrome, Google Docs, Safetyhub, Google Messaging, the Clock and the Google SearchBar,\u201d he said.Apple, Google Dispute Research When Leith reached out to both Apple and Google to comment on his research he received mixed results.\u201cTo date, Apple have responded only with silence (we sent three emails to Apple\u2019s director of user privacy, who declined even to acknowledge receipt of an email,\u201d Leith wrote. Since then, Apple has made public statements critical of Leith\u2019s research and insisting privacy and opt-out measures do exist.\u201cGoogle responded with a number of comments and clarifications,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey also say that they intend to publish public documentation on the telemetry data that they collect.\u201dIn a statement to the numerous publications following the release of the research, Google said:\u201cWe identified flaws in the researcher\u2019s methodology for measuring data volume and disagree with the paper\u2019s claims that an Android device shares 20 times more data than an iPhone. According to our research, these findings are off by an order of magnitude, and we shared our methodology concerns with the researcher before publication.This research largely outlines how smartphones work. Modern cars regularly send basic data about vehicle components, their safety status and service schedules to car manufacturers, and mobile phones work in very similar ways. This report details those communications, which help ensure that iOS or Android software is up to date, services are working as intended, and that the phone is secure and running efficiently.\u201dWhat Are the Privacy Dangers of Mobile Devices Sharing Too Much Data?The privacy dangers of a handset sharing this type of telemetry data are twofold, the researcher noted. One is that Google and Apple can use data to identify a user and track purchases, Leith said. Two, Apple and Google could abuse users\u2019 trust and track their movements.That said, the researcher does point out that the transmission of user data to a device-maker\u2019s backend is necessary for pushing out security updates for specific models. Collecting user data becomes problematic when it\u2019s tied to a specific user, he said.\u201cMany studies have shown that location data linked over time can be used to de-anonymize [the individual],\u201d he said.DIY Privacy HackIn the report, the author outlines a number of methods a user can take to avoid sharing mobile data. While he said there are no workaround options to prevent an iPhone from sharing data with Apple, there are steps Pixel users can take to prevent the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the data sharing with Google.\u201cWith Pixel, a user can choose to start up the phone with the network connection disabled,\u201d he explained. \u201cNext, before the user enables the network connection they can disable Google-specific services such as Google Play, YouTube before enabling the network connection.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)Mobile SecurityPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Hackers painted a bullseye on the backs of online financial institutions in 2020 as the pandemic shuttered local branch offices and forced customers online. Over the past 12 months, incidents of adware nearly tripled. And, overall in 2020 researchers saw a slight drop in the number of mobile cyberattacks, according to a report released Monday by Kaspersky.In its\u2019 Mobile Malware Evolution 2020, Kaspersky documents the current mobile threat landscape and identifies 2021 mobile security trends. It found that while mobile threats have dipped slightly over the past year, criminals have focused on the quality of mobile attacks versus mass infections.\u201cWe saw a decrease in the number of attacks in the first half of the year, which can be attributed to the confusion of the first months of the pandemic,\u201d wrote Victor Chebyshev, a mobile security researcher at Kaspersky and author of the report. \u201cThe attackers had other things to worry about [and] were back at it in the second half.\u201d\n\nWhat Are the Biggest Mobile Threats? Leading mobile threat types in 2020 is adware, accounting for 57 percent of attacks. Risk tools came in second, representing 21 percent of attacks. Trojan droppers and mobile trojans each represented 4.5 percent of attacks and SMS-based trojans represented 4 percent of actual mobile criminal activity.Risk tools, as Kaspersky calls them, are potentially dangerous or unwanted programs that are not inherently malicious, but are used to hide files or terminate applications and could be used with malicious intent.Each of aforementioned threats, save adware, saw steep declines in attack occurrences. Compared to 2019, adware attacks against mobile users grew from representing 22 percent of attacks to 57 percent of all types of mobile threats.The Most Popular Adware in 2020? Leading adware families included Ewind (representing 65 percent of adware samples found) followed by FakeAdBlocker (representing 15 percent of samples) and trailed by HiddenAd (accounting for 10 percent of samples).How did Ewind Adware Becomes to Potent? \u00a0\u00a0Researchers credit the success of Ewind with the nearly 2 million Ewind.kp Android installer packages bundled successfully within legitimate applications, such as icons and resource files. These seemingly innocuous downloads, Chebyshev wrote, are readily available at seemingly trustworthy third-part Android application download sites.What Mobile Malware Did Apple\u2019s iOS Face? Unlike Android handsets, Apple\u2019s closed hardware and software ecosystem posed unique challenges for criminals, however it didn\u2019t deter them completely.Topping threats to Apple\u2019s smattering of mobile devices \u2013 including its iPhone and iPad lines \u2013 are drive-by downloads abusing the company\u2019s Safari browser rendering engine called WebKit, Kaspersky said.\u201cIn 2020, our colleagues at TrendMicro detected the use of Apple WebKit exploits for remote code execution (RCE) in conjunction with Local Privilege Escalation exploits to deliver malware to an iOS device,\u201d wrote Chebyshev.\u201cThe payload was the\u00a0LightSpy\u00a0trojan whose objective was to extract personal information from a mobile device, including correspondence from instant messaging apps and browser data, take screenshots, and compile a list of nearby Wi-Fi networks,\u201d he wrote.The iOS malware LightSpy has a modular design. \u201cOne of the modules discovered was a network scanner that collected information about nearby devices including their MAC addresses and manufacturer names. TrendMicro said LightSpy distribution took advantage of news portals, such as COVID-19 update sites,\u201d according to the report.What\u2019s the Most Common Android Trojans in 2020? Popular malware families targeting the Android operating system in 2020 were banking trojans GINP, Cebruser, Ghimob and Cookiethief.\u201cThe trojan\u00a0Ghimob\u00a0was one of 2020\u2019s most exciting discoveries,\u201d according to the Kaspersky report. \u201cIt stole credentials for various financial systems including online banking applications and cryptocurrency wallets in Brazil.\u201dThe trojan was rudimentary, but effective, and abused the Android Accessibility feature with a common mobile overlay scheme.\u201cWhenever the user tried to access the Ghimob removal menu, the trojan immediately opened the home screen to protect itself from being uninstalled,\u201d according to the report.Cookiethief Android Trojan Abuses Cookies As for Cookiethief malware, researchers said the trojan targeted mobile cookies, which store unique identifiers of web sessions and hence can be used for authorization. \u201cFor example, an attacker could log in to a victim\u2019s Facebook account and post a phishing link or spread spam. Typically, cookies on a mobile device are stored in a secure location and are inaccessible to applications, even malicious ones. To circumvent the restriction, Cookiethief tried to get root privileges on the device with the help of an exploit, before it began its malicious activities,\u201d the researcher wrote.There was Significant Growth in Mobile Financial Threats in 2020.\u201cWe detected 156,710 installation packages for mobile banking Trojans in 2020, which is twice the previous year\u2019s figure and comparable to 2018,\u201d Kaspersky wrote.Top banking Trojans were Agent (72 percent of infections) followed by a long list of banking Trojans representing single-digit infections including Wroba, Rotexy and Anubis.Interest in targeting financial institutions is tied to the pandemic, researchers said. \u201cThe inability to visit a bank branch forced customers to switch to mobile and online banking, and banks, to consider stepping up the development of those services,\u201d they wrote.On the Bright Side: Incidents of Mobile Ransomware Plummet\u201cOverall, the decrease in ransomware can be associated with the assumption that attackers have been converting from ransomware to bankers or combining the features of the two. Current versions of Android prevent applications from locking the screen, so even successful ransomware infection is useless,\u201d researchers noted.How Do Adware and Malware Criminal Gangs Work Together? It is unclear how new the trend is, but the Kaspersky report offered insights into the seldom-described symbiotic relationship between adware pushers and those behind malware infections.\u201cAdware creators are interested in obstructing the removal of their products from a mobile device. They typically work with malware developers to achieve this. An example of a partnership like that is the use of various trojan botnets: we saw a number of\u00a0these cases\u00a0in 2020,\u201d the report stated.The mutually beneficial relationship starts with bots infecting mobile devices.\u201cAs soon as the owners of the botnet and their [criminal] customers come to an agreement, the bot receives a command to download, install and run a payload, in this case, adware. If the victim is annoyed by the unsolicited advertising and removes the source, the bot will simply repeat the steps,\u201d the report outlines.Those infections can sometime also lead to \u201celevate access privileges on the device, placing adware in the system area and making the user unable to remove them without outside help,\u201d they said.How Android Gear Comes Pre-Installed with Malware?Another example of the partnership between less-than-savory actors is a scheme called \u201cpreinstalls\u201d. This is when the phone\u2019s maker preloads an adware application or a component with the firmware.\u201cAs a result, the device hits the shelves already infected. This is not a\u00a0supply chain attack, but a premeditated step on the part of the manufacturer for which it receives extra profits,\u201d Kaspersky explains.Researchers explain this is a particularly difficult, if not impossible, infection to inoculate.\u201c[N]o security solution is yet capable of reading an OS system partition to check if the device is infected. Even if detection is successful, the user is left alone with the threat, without a possibility of removing the malware quickly or easily, as Android system partitions are write protected. This vector of spreading persistent threats is likely to become increasingly popular in the absence of new effective exploits for popular Android versions,\u201d it said.MalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "A text message-based tax scam is making the rounds in the U.K., in a probable harbinger of things to come as the U.S. tax season gets underway in earnest.SMS messages are going out to unsuspecting U.K. citizens claiming to be from Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the country\u2019s IRS-equivalent. Spotted by researchers at Sophos, the messages tell targets that they\u2019ve received a refund for \u201coverpayment in year 2019/2020\u201d and are asked to click a link to \u201cproceed.\u201dThe link, https://www.hmrev.customs.[REDACTED].com, seems somewhat believable, noted Paul Ducklin, researcher at Sophos, as does the rest of the campaign \u2013 it\u2019s \u201cannoyingly believable\u201d he noted in a blog on the campaign, posted Friday.\u201cIn this scam, we have to admit that the crooks pulled off a surprisingly believable sequence of web pages \u2013 not perfect, but visually believable nevertheless,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir pages look similar to the pages you\u2019d see on a genuine U.K. government site; they\u2019ve included niceties such as a coronavirus warning in order to add a touch of timely realism; they\u2019ve mostly used the right sort of terminology, such as remembering to ask for your National Insurance number instead of your SSN; and they\u2019ve remembered not to put a \u2018Z\u2019 in the word \u2018organization.'\u201dA Believable Mobile Tax ScamThe scam begins when a target clicks through to a mobile web page, which is a set of well-designed phishing pages designed to harvest personal data. They ask for various data points, including \u201cmother\u2019s maiden name,\u201d which is of course a common security-gate question for financial applications.Ducklin noted that the last page also asks for bank-account details and finally a credit-card number, expiration and CVV \u2013 perhaps the first red flag in the attack flow.Click to enlarge. Source: Sophos\u201cIf you didn\u2019t realize before, you should figure that this is a scam at this point, because there\u2019s simply no reason for anyone to ask for your credit-card data in order to make a refund to your bank account,\u201d Ducklin pointed out. \u201cIn particular, the CVV code (usually three digits on the back of your card) is used for verifying online payments, and in this case, you aren\u2019t paying for anything.\u201dIf the credit-card ask isn\u2019t a put-off, the victim will click \u201csubmit\u201d and the data will be whisked off to the attackers\u2019 databases. After that, the user is shown a decoy page, which is \u201ca believable reason to discourage you from checking up right away with the real HMRC website,\u201d Ducklin said.After a few seconds, this phony page redirects to the official U.K. government tax gateway home page, and the victim\u2019s browsing history is deleted, so there\u2019s no easy way to look back and see what happened.The attack is surprisingly well-crafted, according to the researcher, and people in other parts of the world should be prepared for this type of increasing savviness. The U.S. tax season of course is just beginning to crank up \u2014 a popular time for fraudsters.\u201cEvery month of the year has some sort of tax relevance somewhere in the world, and tax scamming cybercrooks take advantage of the many different regional tax filing seasons to customize their criminality to where you live,\u201d Ducklin noted.How to Tell if It\u2019s a Mobile ScamThe crooks may have done a fairly good job of crafting verisimilitude into the attack flow, but a few mistakes were made.For one, the initial phishing pages weren\u2019t hosted on an official .gov.uk page, as any legitimate governmental process would be.\u201cAlthough it\u2019s easy to register .com and .co.uk domains in the U.K., the .gov.uk domain has a strict registration process that a cybercrook would find hard to bypass,\u201d Ducklin explained.Also, a close look at the copy reveals spelling errors and typos that one would not expect on an official website, such as \u201cyou\u201d being spelled as \u201cyouu.\u201dOn a page asking users to identify one\u2019s profile, there\u2019s an \u201cother\u201d option explained as, \u201cPlease select this option if none of the above mentioned category fits you.\u201d\u201cCategory\u201d of course should have been plural.Another example can be found on the decoy page, which asks readers to \u201cplease bare with us as we assess and release these funds to your account\u201d \u2013 using the wrong homonym.Also, the fraudsters take victims directly to the purported tax-related page. However, the U.K. government gateway would have required anyone to log in, and to use two-factor authentication.\u201cThis scam was surprisingly believable, but the telltale signs were there nevertheless: A giveaway spelling blunder by the crooks on the starting page, an obviously incorrect URL in the address bar, and a request for personal information that was irrelevant to the claimed refund,\u201d said Ducklin.What is SMS Phishing?SMS-based phishing, known as \u201csmishing,\u201d is when cybercriminals send phishing links within mobile text messages. These approaches are increasingly popular, thanks to the ways that crooks can get around target scrutiny.\u201cSMSes are limited to 160 characters, including any web links,\u201d Ducklin noted. \u201cSo there\u2019s much less room for crooks to make spelling and grammatical errors, and they don\u2019t need to bother with all the formalized cultural pleasantries (such as \u2018Dear Your Actual Name\u2019) that you\u2019d expect in an email.\u201dAlso, the links sent in text messages are hard to vet in advance, and \u201conce you\u2019ve tapped on the link and the browser window has filled the screen, it\u2019s harder to spot that you are on an imposter site,\u201d he added.How to Protect Against Mobile Phishing?Ducklin offers a few best practices for avoiding becoming a smishing victim:Whenever possible, check the address bar to vet the URLsCarefully read for giveaway mistakes in messages and web pagesImplement 2FAUse common sense and never provide credit-card details without there being a good reason for itDuring tax season, people should bookmark the official website of their country\u2019s tax office and only ever go there using their own links.\u201cIf you only ever visit important websites using bookmarks of your own, you will always sidestep crooks who send you phishing links,\u201d Ducklin said.Threatpost WEBINAR: Save your spot for\u00a0\u201c15 Cybersecurity Gaffes SMBs Make,\u201d a\u00a0\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Feb. 24 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Cybercriminals count on you making these mistakes, but our experts will help you lock down your small- to mid-sized business like it was a Fortune 100.\u00a0Register NOW\u00a0for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar on Wed., Feb. 24.\u00a0\u00a0Mobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "T-Mobile USA has reported a data breach \u2013 its fourth in three years.The wireless carrier disclosed the breach last week via its website, saying that it detected and shut down \u201cmalicious, unauthorized access to some information\u201d related to T-Mobile accounts. Specifically, that data consisted of customer proprietary network information (CPNI) \u2013 a data set that the FCC calls \u201csome of the most sensitive personal information that carriers and providers have about their customers.\u201dCPNI includes records of which phone numbers users called; the frequency, duration, and timing of such calls; and any services purchased by the consumer, such as call waiting. T-Mobile said that the thieves in this case lifted phone numbers, number of lines subscribed to on accounts, \u201cand, in some cases, call-related information.\u201dThe good news is that the data accessed did not include names on the account, physical or email addresses, financial data, credit-card information, Social Security numbers, tax ID, passwords or PINs, the wireless company said in the notice.T-Mobile said it is investigating the incident with help from law enforcement and a security firm, and it told outlets that 0.2 percent of customers (around 200,000 people) were affected.While the attackers weren\u2019t able to collect any highly sensitive personal data, there is still risk posed to those whose phone numbers were stolen in the breach, Hank Schless, senior manager for security solutions at Lookout, told Threatpost.\u201cAn area code is all an attacker needs to carry out a socially engineered mobile phishing attack,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attacker can pretend to be T-Mobile support over voice or text in order to get customers to share their login credentials. Since customers know there was a recent security incident, they may not think twice before engaging with an individual who claims they can help. If this were successful and the attacker made their way into the customer\u2019s account, they could have access to sensitive information associated with the account.\u201dLookout discovered a mobile phishing campaign in February that associated area codes with popular banks in the area to try to phish mobile banking login credentials.\u201cMobile phishing represents one of the biggest security blind spots for individuals and enterprise security teams alike,\u201d Schless said.4th Incident in 3 YearsT-Mobile previously reported breaches in August 2018, November 2019 and most recently in March.The 2018 incident impacted 2.3 million subscribers, exposing customers\u2019 names, billing ZIP codes, phone numbers, email addresses, account numbers and account types (prepaid or postpaid).In 2019, about 1.26 million of T-Mobile\u2019s prepaid were affected by a breach that included names, billing addresses (if provided), phone numbers, account numbers and CPNI.The 2020 breach meanwhile impacted both employees and customers (it\u2019s unclear how many were affected). Cybercriminals\u00a0accessed employee email accounts, some of which contained account information for T-Mobile customers, including names and addresses, phone numbers, account numbers and more.In all three of those cases, as with the most recent incident, financial and Social Security data was not impacted.Sprint meanwhile, which merged with T-Mobile in 2020, had two of its own in 2019.\u201cThe volume of attacks and successful attacks against wireless carriers continues to rise,\u201d Brandon Hoffman, CISO at Netenrich, told Threatpost. \u201cIn this particular case, one has to wonder if it is related to the merging of two titans. Sprint had a series of issues last year and this is a another in a list of success attacks on T-Mobile.\u201dHe added, \u201cin our industry, when issues continue regardless of impact, we usually go back to the drawing board. It feels like there is an opportunity here to review the foundations of cyber relative to the merged entity and find out where quick wins can be had to shore up defenses. With the volume of successful attacks that we are seeing, either they are suffering from consistent advanced persistent threats or there is something easily exploited that is being overlooked.\u201dIt should be noted that T-Mobile and Sprint were also impacted by an incident in December 2019, where hundreds of thousands of mobile phone bills for AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile subscribers were laid open to anyone with an internet connection, thanks to the oversight of a contractor working with Sprint.According to a media investigation, the contractor misconfigured a cloud storage bucket on Amazon Web Services (AWS), in which more than 261,300 documents were stored \u2013 mainly cell phone bills from Sprint customers who switched from other carriers.Cell phone bills are a treasure trove of data, and include names, addresses and phone numbers along with spending histories and in many cases, call and text message records. In this case, some of the bills dated back to 2015; it\u2019s unclear how long the bucket was exposed.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "Smartphones, tablets, collaboration apps and other modern framework tools are critical to maintaining productivity remotely, but they also demand an integrated security strategy purpose-built for mobile devices.The coronavirus pandemic has completely upended the way we work, educate and socialize. Soon after the rapid onset of the virus, organizations were forced to fully adopt work-from-home and other remote models. Luckily, employees quickly proved they could be productive and successful without being directly connected to the corporate network.In fact, in mid-March, when most organizations sent their employees home, Lookout saw a 25-percent jump in iOS device usage. At the same time, mobile phishing attacks against consumer and enterprise users spiked across all geographies and industries. In correlation with the iOS jump, there was a 37-percent increase in mobile phishing attempts between Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. Cybercriminals are taking advantage of social uncertainty and exploiting the fact that we rely more on mobile devices to stay productive.You\u2019ve likely already adapted your security strategy to secure employee desktops and laptops, but if you haven\u2019t yet secured mobile, it\u2019s not too late to catch up. Here are some attack methods to be aware of when choosing a mobile-security strategy.Malicious Actors Target Mobile for a ReasonPhishing attempts are much harder to identify on a mobile device. Spearphishing campaigns exploit human vulnerabilities, such as our trust of our phones and tablets. They also take advantage of the smaller mobile screens to hide the tell-tale signs we\u2019re used to identifying on desktop computers. Attackers can pose as a legitimate party by taking advantage of VoIP phone numbers, for example, or the simplified design of a messaging app.Threat actors will also spoof URLs and take advantage of the fact that mobile browsers shorten URLs to hide the true identity of the webpage. Also, many people don\u2019t think to preview a link because we\u2019re so conditioned to just tap on anything that\u2019s sent to us. Unlike a company-issued laptop, mobile devices rarely have anti-phishing or anti-malware installed. Considering smartphones and tablets have just as much access to corporate resources, they should receive the same level of protection as those traditional endpoints.Beware of VishingA recent warning from the FBI and CISA indicated that cybercriminals have turned to \u201cvishing\u201d to exploit the lack of mobile-device protection and attack remote workers. Vishing, or voice phishing, is a form of phishing where attackers trick you into giving up information over the phone; oftentimes posing as helpdesk or IT personnel. Since vishing relies on human error, security measures like VPNs, multi-factor authentication and one-time passwords cannot defend against these types of attacks.While vishing takes social engineering to the next level, the kill chain to access corporate data is no different from web-based credential-harvesting attacks. Once the attacker successfully phishes the credentials, they can quickly gain access to the infrastructure and execute their attack, doing extreme damage in a short time frame. Because the user is being targeted and convinced to share their credentials, the vulnerability lies in human behavior. Enterprises need to train and educate all employees about what mobile phishing attacks look like and the best practices on how to avoid falling for them.Phishing and Chromebooks: Secure your Remote LearnersChromebooks have become an essential, cost-effective tool for education systems that offer remote learning. They connect students and educators with resources, and help students with homework and learning, in conjunction with Google Classroom, Google Workspace for education and other apps.Chrome OS, with all of its built-in security features, has a reputation of being more secure than legacy operating systems. The kernel cannot be accessed and the apps run in isolation, which makes it difficult to compromise the device under normal use. It also has automated updates for patching vulnerabilities. But as much as we like Chromebook OS for secure, remote learning, Chromebooks are a modern endpoint device facing the same human-based security challenges as any other type of devices.In other words, phishing and web-content attacks pose just as much of a threat to Chromebooks as they do to smartphones and tablets. In addition, Chromebooks use the Google Play store to download apps, which means that if a malicious app makes its way into the store, it could also affect Chrome OS devices. Finally, Chromebooks are subject to network-based threats.Where Do We Go from Here?With most of us working away from the office, each of us now represents a remote office that your organization needs to secure. Many organizations turned to VPNs when shifting to remote work, but that leaves a number of security gaps, including the fact that many of us don\u2019t use VPNs when using our mobile devices.With work now happening wherever the employee resides, you must move security from perimeters to the endpoints.

        "raw text": "As pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, mobile phishing gangs are swapping up their tactics in hopes to get their hands on critical research.Cybercriminals previously targeted pharmaceutical company employee credentials. However, new research shows that 77 percent of pharmaceutical mobile phishing attempts in the third-quarter of 2020 sought to deliver malware on victims\u2019 systems. This shift, which reflects a 106 percent increase in malware delivery in mobile phishing, shows cybercriminals turning to spyware, remote access functionality and more in order to access \u201ccrown jewel\u201d COVID-19 research data from pharmaceutical companies.\u201cOn a global scale, there have been multiple reports of foreign adversaries targeting pharmaceutical industry executives with mobile spear phishing attacks,\u201d according to Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at Lookout wrote on Tuesday in an analysis of the trend. \u201cBoth the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. and the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency in the U.S. issued advisories to organizations involved in the COVID-19 response to shore up their security practices. State-sponsored campaigns prove that nation-state virtual espionage is not just an issue for government entities.\u201dAs the pandemic continue to rattle the world, pharmaceutical companies in particular are under speculation as the hunt continues for an effective vaccine. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer recently announced a vaccine under development, which it said proved 90 percent effective in the latest trials.Given the current pandemic, any information about a COVID-19 vaccine is highly sought after by cybercriminals \u2013 whether for espionage or for ransomware. \u00a0 A ransomware attack in October, for instance, hit eResearchTechnology, a medical software company that supplies pharma companies with tools for conducting clinical trials \u2013 including trials for COVID-19 vaccines10. And\u00a0APT29, a Russia-based advanced persistent threat (APT) group also known as Cozy Bear, reportedly targeted several pharmaceutical research institutions in various countries around the world in July.Mobile Phishing Rates SpikeIn the first quarter of 2020, when COVID-19 was surging globally, researchers saw a spike in pharmaceutical mobile phishing rates \u2013 from 7.06 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 to 15.26 percent in Q1 2020.\u201cThe reason that mobile devices have become a primary target is because a well-crafted attack can be close to impossible to spot,\u201d said Schless. \u201cMobile devices have smaller screens, simplified user interfaces, and people generally exercise less caution on them than they do on computers.\u201dMeanwhile, while previously cybercriminals were relying on phishing attacks that attempted to carry out credential harvesting, in 2020, the aim shifted to malware delivery.\u00a0For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2019, 83 percent of attacks aimed to launch credential harvesting while 50 percent aimed to deliver malware (Of note, some attacks were aimed at both credential harvesting and malware delivery).However, in the first quarter of 2020, only 40 percent of attacks targeted credentials, while 78 percent aimed to deliver malware. And, in the third quarter of 2020, 27 percent targeted credentials, and 81 percent looked to load malware.Pharmaceutical mobile phishing attacks. Credit: LookoutResearchers believe that this shift signifies that attackers are investing in malware more for pharmaceutical companies. For one, successful delivery of spyware or surveillanceware to a device could result in longer-term success for the attacker. Furthermore, said researchers, attackers want to be able to observe everything the user is doing and look into the files their device accesses and stores.Moving forward, researchers recommend pharmaceutical companies adopt a modern approach that is \u201cbuilt from the ground up for mobile.\u201d\u201cEmployees in pharmaceutical organizations use iOS, Android, and ChromeOS devices every day to stay productive and increase efficiency no matter their role,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThis makes them targets for cyberattackers because their devices are a treasure trove of data and a\u00a0gateway to enterprise cloud infrastructure.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "A new banking trojan has been discovered targeting Android users, with the capabilities to spy on 153 mobile apps from various banks, cryptocurrencies and exchanges.Researchers describe the banking trojan, called Ghimob, as a \u201cfull-fledged spy in your pocket\u201d that can be accessed remotely by its operators. Cybercriminals can use the trojan to bypass financial institutions\u2019 security and antifraud measures, in order to make fraudulent transactions on the victim\u2019s smartphones.Kaspersky telemetry shows that all victims of the Ghimob mobile banking trojan are currently located in Brazil at the moment. However, because some of the targeted apps are based outside of Brazil, they believe Ghimob has big plans to expand abroad \u2013 including to Angola, Germany, Mozambique, Paraguay, Peru and Portugal.Of the 153 apps targeted by Ghimob, 112 are in Brazil.\u201cGhimob is the first Brazilian mobile banking trojan ready to expand and target financial institutions and their customers living in other countries,\u201d said researchers with Kaspersky, in a Monday analysis. \u201cOur telemetry findings have confirmed victims in Brazil, but as we saw, the trojan is well prepared to steal credentials from banks, fintechs, exchanges, crypto-exchanges and credit cards from financial institutions operating in many countries, so it will naturally be an international expansion.\u201dAttack ProcessGhimob victims are first persuaded to install a malicious file via an email written in Brazilian Portuguese. This email purports to be from a creditor and provides a link where the recipient could view more information. The link leads to an app, which pretends to be various legitimate tools, such as Google Defender, Google Docs or WhatsApp Updater.As soon as the trojan is installed and launched, it first attempts to sniff out any possible emulators or debuggers. If any are present, the malware terminates itself.\u201cNewer versions of the malware have moved the emulator names to an encrypted configuration file,\u201d said researchers. \u201cIf those previous checks are passed, the user is then presented with the default Android accessibility window, as the malware heavily relies on accessibility to work.\u201dThe malware then sends a message back to the command-and-control (C2) server containing the victims\u2019 phone data, including the model, whether it has a screen lock activated and a list of all targeted apps that are installed on the phone (including their version numbers).CapabilitiesGhimob has screen-recording capabilities allowing it to record when a user inputs their screen lock pattern, and later replay it to unlock the device. \u00a0It also can block the user from uninstalling it, restarting or shutting down the device.It also relies on a common overlay screen tactic used by Android mobile banking trojans to avoid detection, where the cybercriminal can insert a black screen as an overlay or open a website in a full screen. While the user looks at that overlay screen, in the background the attack performs the transaction by using a financial app running on the victim\u2019s smartphone.Once downloaded, the app then can target various apps on the victims\u2019 smartphone to carry out fraudulent transactions.Finally, \u201cfrom a technical standpoint,\u00a0Ghimob\u00a0is also interesting in that it uses C2s with fallback protected by Cloudflare, hides its real C2 with DGA and employs several other tricks, posing as a strong competitor in this field,\u201d noted researchers. \u201cCompared to\u00a0BRATA\u00a0or\u00a0Basbanke, another mobile banking trojan family originating in Brazil,\u00a0Ghimob\u00a0is far more advanced and richer in features, and has strong persistence.\u201dTies to GuildmaResearchers tied the campaign back to the Guildma threat actor, a well-known Brazilian banking trojan, mainly due to the two sharing the same infrastructure.\u201cIt is also important to note that the protocol used in the mobile version is very similar to that used for the Windows version,\u201d said researchers.Guildma is a threat actor that\u2019s part of the\u00a0Tetrade family of banking trojans \u2013 Kaspersky\u2019s designation for four large banking trojan families created, developed and spread by Brazilian crooks. Ghimob shows that Guildma has been working on bringing in new techniques, creating new malware and targeting new victims, researchers said.Moving forward, researchers recommend that financial institutions watch these threats closely. They also suggest taking measures such as \u201cimproving their authentication processes, boosting anti-fraud technology and threat intel data, and trying to understand and mitigate all of the risks that this new mobile RAT family poses.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "The Wroba mobile banking trojan has made a major pivot, targeting people in the U.S. for the first time.According to researchers at Kaspersky, a wave of attacks are taking aim at U.S. Android and iPhone users in an effort that started on Thursday. The campaign uses text messages to spread, using fake notifications for \u201cpackage deliveries\u201d as a lure.The message inside the SMS contains a link and reads, \u201cYour parcel has been sent out. Please check and accept it,\u201d noted researchers from Kaspersky, in an emailed alert on Friday.If users click on the link, the next thing that happens depends on which operating system is used by the device. A click takes Android users to a malicious site, which in turn surfaces an alert to users saying that the browser is out-of-date and needs to be updated. If the user clicks \u2018OK\u2019, next the downloading of a trojanized browser package with the malicious application begins.But where Android users are served up the full Wroba download, according to researchers, the executable doesn\u2019t work on iPhone. For iOS users the Wroba operators instead engineer a redirect to a phishing page. The page mimics the Apple ID login page in an effort to harvest credentials from Apple aficionados, but no malware is installed.Apple had more than half of the total U.S. smartphone market share as of May.Wroba has been around for years, but previously mainly targeted users in APAC. It was first developed as an Android-specific mobile banking trojan, capable of stealing files related to financial transactions, but has since expanded its functionality. Researchers believe the operator behind Wroba are China-based and known as \u201cRoaming Mantis.\u201dThis latest iteration of Wroba can send SMS messages, check which apps are installed, open web pages, harvest any files related to financial transactions, steal contact lists, call specified numbers and show fake phishing pages to steal victim\u2019s credentials, researchers said.Once it has infected a device, Wroba uses some of its functionality \u2013 stolen contact lists and the SMS capability \u2013 to propagate, using infected devices to spread further by sending SMS with malicious links, purporting to come from the host.\u201cWroba shows how delivering malware to a device can enable longer-term gain for the attack,\u201d according to Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at Lookout, which has been tracking Wroba as well.\u201cA credential-harvesting link only targets you for one purpose, such as when you receive an SMS saying your bank account has been compromised and the intent is to phishing your banking credentials,\u201d he told Threatpost.\u201cWroba, on the other hand, can sit silently in the background and deliver credential harvesting pages to your browser at will,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as it goes unnoticed, it can attempt to grab your login data for even your most private accounts.\u201dThe malware has targeted users worldwide since the start of the year, researchers said, mainly in China, Japan and the Russian Federation.\u201cThe USA is currently not at the top of the list but it seems that cybercriminals are heading to this region and the number of users seeing Wroba will increase,\u201d according to Kaspersky. \u201cThe wave was detected on 29th of October and targeted users in different states of USA (judging by the phone numbers that were the targets of this campaign).\u201dThe firm added, \u201cPreviously seen campaigns targeted users from APAC, so it is interesting to see how cybercriminals expand their targets.\u201dIn 2018, Wroba saw a major reboot when it began targeting Europe and the Middle East in addition to Asian countries. According to Kaspersky researchers at the time, it also expanded its capabilities to include cryptomining as well as the iOS phishing tactic mentioned previously. At that point, it was spreading via DNS hijacking, which redirected users to a malicious webpage that, as in the current campaign distributed a trojanized application (at that time, it was pretending to be either Facebook or Chrome).Roaming Mantis has swarmed into the U.S. in the past, it should be noted. This summer, it was spotted trotting out a different SMS phishing campaign that spread the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which was disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, also steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims\u2019 devices. It started by going after South Korean and Japanese speakers, but then expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.Schless told Threatpost that according to Lookout data, 88 percent of U.S. consumer phishing attacks so far in 2020 were attempts to deliver malware to the mobile device.To avoid becoming a victim of Wroba, or any other mobile malware, users should employ basic security hygiene, researchers stressed, such as only downloading applications from official stores; disabling the installation of applications from third-party sources in smartphone settings; and avoid clicking on suspicious links from unknown senders, or even suspicious links from known senders.\u201cPeople are still grasping to avoid phishing attacks by email,\u201d Ray Kelly, principal security engineer at WhiteHat Security, told Threatpost. \u201cNow, SMS messaging is complicating matters further. SMS should be treated the same as email, never click on links from unknown or suspicious senders.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "The line between our personal and professional lives is blurring in an unprecedented fashion as we approach the 2020 presidential election. From Oracle and Walmart\u2019s plans to invest in TikTok to a bug in Joe Biden\u2019s campaign app that exposed millions of voter files \u2013 the role mobile technology will play in elections moving forward is critical.The election is only a week away, and there has been much discussion about how absentee and early voting will impact the outcome. But even before ballots started to hit the postal service, the spread of misinformation was already well underway, leaving confused Americans in its wake.Human error is inevitable, even among the most well-educated users. And while 2020 has brought many challenges, perhaps the most critical from a social perspective is how we have intertwined mobile devices into our daily lives. Unfortunately, the reality of today\u2019s threat landscape is that successful spearphishing attacks no longer rely exclusively on emails. So, what does this have to do with the election?A typical campaign text.Attacks aimed at disrupting the election are usually run subtly, by using campaigns to bait victims into phishing scams. Recently, the presidential campaigns have tried to reach voters directly by sending SMS messages that ask if they\u2019ve registered to vote or if they\u2019re planning on supporting a candidate. Threat actors can easily mimic this strategy and include a malicious link in the message. We\u2019ve seen a similar tactic used in an ongoing mobile phishing campaign that sends a message purporting to be a missed package delivery with a link to a fake claim page that is a mobile phishing attack.There are now endless ways for attackers to socially engineer you to tap on a malicious link \u2013 from messaging apps and social-media platforms to dating apps. It also doesn\u2019t help that mobile devices have smaller screens and a simplified user experience, which makes it hard to figure out what\u2019s fake and what\u2019s real.This September, at least three TikTok profiles promoted multiple fraudulent mobile apps that generated nearly half a million dollars in total profit. Reportedly, these accounts socially engineered their followers into downloading malicious apps. While far less targeted than the social-engineering attacks we typically think of, the processes and goals are identical.We have to remember that attackers are business people too. They target victims, and use methods they think will deliver the largest return. One of the big opportunities in 2020 is the U.S. presidential election, and the targets are mobile users. Tablets and smartphones have become an integral part of the way we work and play \u2013 and voting-season activity is no different. Political campaigns use them as vehicles to interact with voters. The public gets their information from their mobile devices. There have even been attempts to conduct local elections and primaries with mobile apps.Potential phishing text.The increasing usage of mobile devices has numerous upsides, such as greater engagement and higher voter turnout. But this should only be happening if mobile security is part of the greater election-security plan. The Vote Joe app was a prime example of a campaign app that had significant security flaws. A bug was discovered in the app that allowed malicious actors to see a voter\u2019s home address, date of birth, gender, ethnicity and party affiliation.Not only did the sign-up process for Vote Joe lack basic email verification functions, but it also gave these unverified users access to a database of registered voter information. While the intent was to increase voter engagement, it ended up inappropriately exposing people\u2019s private information.Mobile security and cyber-hygiene are essential to keeping political campaigns and their data secure, and not just for the 2020 elections. The good news is that awareness of the election- and campaign-security challenges is increasing, and there are resources to assist. Organizations like Defending Digital Campaigns, a nonprofit with the goal of ensuring that campaigns are secure, offer free or low-cost security solutions and training to candidates. In addition to security measures, we also need to educate the general public about how mobile devices are prime targets for malicious actors.In today\u2019s technology-driven world, device security is a baseline to keep every aspect of our lives safe \u2013 whether it\u2019s our company, our personal information or the integrity of our elections. By educating people to be vigilant and making cybersecurity an integral part of our electoral process, we will be better positioned to safeguard our democracy.Hank Schless is senior manager for security solutions at Lookout.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider community by\u00a0visiting past contributions.GovernmentInfoSec InsiderMobile SecurityVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "The meteoric rise of the game Among Us appears to be outpacing its developer\u2019s ability to keep up with malicious actors. On Sunday night, a specific ongoing attack forced InnerSloth, the company behind the game, to hastily roll out an update designed to kick bad actors off the game\u2019s servers \u2014 likely along with some innocent players as well.Among Us takes place in a space setting, where some platers are \u201ccrewmates,\u201d and others are \u201cimposters\u201d that live among us. As crewmates prepare their ship for departure, they must locate and eliminate the imposters before they\u2019re taken out themselves. It so far has 5.3 million downloads on Google Play alone.InnerSloth is asking for patience while the company addresses this and other ongoing security concerns. InnerSloth is run by a three-person team consisting of one developer, one animator and game designer, and one artist. The game was released almost two years ago, but thanks to a long summer spent largely under quarantine its audience has exploded over the past few months.Eris Loris Takes Over Among Us This most recent round of attacks spammed players with ads from a player named Eris Loris, rendering the game useless. Players flooded the Among Us subreddit to report the activity.\u201cSo far every single server I\u2019ve joined is hacked by Eris Loris today,\u201d one user with a NSFW handle name wrote two days ago. \u201cI have tried maybe 40-plus games. Not a single one wasn\u2019t hacked within 10-30 seconds.\u201dThe breach uses bots to overwhelm the game with messages promoting a YouTube channel and Discord operated under the name Eris Loris, threatening to \u201cblow up your phone,\u201d and concluding with a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d endorsement.Among Us Server Update Forest Willard, InnerSloth\u2019s resident programmer, announced a server update Sunday night that tries to identify bad actors on the game and kick them out before they cause trouble. But the move comes with a downside, some players might get kicked off inadvertently, which Willard added in a tweet is for the \u201cgreater good,\u201d that players should view as \u201cemergency maintenance.\u201d\u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t roll this update out sooner is that I was afraid of false positives: You totally might see the game think you\u2019re hacking when you\u2019re not,\u201d\u00a0Willard said in a subsequent tweet. \u201cI\u2019ve done my best to find this kind of bug, but my hand is forced this time.\u201dThreatpost wasn\u2019t able to contact the person behind the Eris Loris breach by the time of publication, but he told Kokatu he attacked Among Us because he thinks it\u2019s funny to rile people up. He added that the blame for the damage to the game falls on InnerSloth and the team\u2019s inability to scale up quickly enough.\u201cAmong Us may be a small developer team, but that\u2019s not my fault,\u201d he added. \u201cThe game is at a scale bigger than most games. There is nothing stopping them from getting more developers, so the \u2018it\u2019s three people\u2019 reasoning means nothing to me.\u201dCan Among Us Scale?InnerSloth\u2019s recent record might back up Eris Loris\u2019 point about scale. A scroll through the Among Us subreddit shows breaches on the game are frequent, in addition to rampant cheating.In early October, a massive spike in traffic kept shutting down the Among Us servers, according to Screen Rant.But that hasn\u2019t stunted the game\u2019s growth yet. Among Us was the most downloaded mobile game in the world during September, with 83.8 million installs, according to SensorTower, which added that\u2019s 40 times more than the same month last year.And just last week New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez went live on Twitch to play Among Us and promote voting, an event that drew in 435,000 viewers just to her stream alone, TechCrunch reported.InnerSloth is in a bit of a pickle here. If the owners make major changes to the game, they could ruin the magic that made it explode in popularity and drive away the audience. If they leave it as-is, malicious actors could drive away players.Prior to the new fix, InnerSloth posted on Twitter that it is \u201c\u2026super duper aware\u201d of the issue and reminded users to, \u201cPlease play private games or with people you trust!!! We\u2019re doing what we can!!\u201dhttps://twitter.com/InnerslothDevs/status/1319471920115376130\u00a0While InnerSloth works out the security bugs on Among Us, the company has decided to delay the release of its sequel, Among Us 2 and instead work on improving the original.\u201cThe main reason we are shooting for a sequel is because the codebase of Among Us 1 is so outdated and not built to support adding so much new content,\u201d InnerSloth said in a recent blog post. \u201cHowever, seeing how many people are enjoying Among Us 1 really makes us want to be able to support the game and take it to the next level. We have decided to cancel Among Us 2 and instead put all our focus into improving Among Us 1.\u201d\u00a0HacksWeb Security",

They allow an attacker to present a fake address for a web page \u2013 which is a problem in the mobile world, where a URL is often the only verification of legitimacy that users have before navigating to a website.\u201cMobile browsers are a pretty special sort of software that end up acting as a user\u2019s multipass for all types of critical applications in their day-to-day life,\u201d explained Rapid7 research director Tod Beardsley, in a blog post on Tuesday. \u201cEssentially, if your browser tells you that a pop-up notification or a page is \u2018from\u2019 your bank, your healthcare provider or some other critical service you depend on, you really should have some mechanism of validating that source. In mobile browsers, that source begins and ends with the URL as shown in the address bar. The fact of the matter is, we really don\u2019t have much else to rely on.\u201dBecause of the lack of real estate for security indicators on the mobile screen, browsers usually block developers from altering anything in the address bar. What\u2019s shown on the screen must correspond with where the page is actually hosted, making it almost impossible to convincingly spoof the location of text or images. However, this group of bugs allows attackers to get around such protections.\u201cThe bugs allow attackers to interfere with the timing between page loads and when the browser gets a chance to refresh the address bar,\u201d said Baloch, in a technical paper also posted on Tuesday. \u201cThey can cause either a pop-up to appear to come from an arbitrary website or can render content in the browser window that falsely appears to come from an arbitrary website.\u201dBaloch released a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit demonstrating the browser-based spoofing vulnerability in Safari for both iOS and Mac (CVE-2020-9987).\u201cThe vulnerability occurs due to Safari preserving address bar of the URL when requested over an arbitrary port, the set interval function reloads bing.com:8080 every 2 milliseconds,\u201d he explained.\u00a0\u201cHence, the user is unable to recognize the redirection from the original URL to spoofed URL. What makes this vulnerability more effective in Safari by default does not reveal port number in URL unless and until focus is set via cursor.\u201dEssentially, all of this means that an attacker could set up a website for phishing, spreading malware or spoofing news sources for disinformation purposes, and then send the URL to a target via email, SMS or messaging app, or social media.\u201cImagine a text message from a spoofed phone number that says, \u2018There is an important message from your payment processor, click here,\u2019 and then you click without really looking, and end up on a web page that clearly (but falsely) says it\u2019s PayPal, and hey, can you give up your password real quick?\u201d Beardsley noted. \u201cThis seems like a pretty effective attack, given that the address bar is really the only signal you have to tell \u2018where\u2019 your browser \u2018is.'\u201dHere\u2019s a list of affected browsers and assigned CVEs:The bugs could affect a wide range of users, even for the lesser-used browsers. Bolt for instance has more than 210,000 reviews and ranks No. 47 in the App Store, and UC Browser has 500 million downloads from Google Play.Users of the affected browsers should update where possible and otherwise remain wary.\u201cWith the ever-growing sophistication of spear-phishing attacks, exploitation of browser-based vulnerabilities such as address-bar spoofing for conducting targeted phishing attacks may exacerbate the success of targeted attacks and hence prove to be very lethal,\u201d Baloch concluded. \u201cFirst and foremost, it is easy to persuade the victim into stealing credentials or distributing malware when the address bar points to a trusted website and giving no indicators forgery, secondly since the vulnerability exploits a specific feature in a browser, it can evade several anti-phishing schemes and solutions.\u201dThe research also exposed similar bugs in some desktop browsers, according to the researchers, who said that those will be disclosed in a later writeup.\u201cIt should be mentioned that MacOS Safari was also affected by the same issue (and fixed in the Big Sur MacOS release from a couple days ago),\u201d Beardsley said.\u00a0\u00a0Mobile SecurityVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Boom! Mobile\u2019s U.S. website recently fell victim to an e-commerce attack, putting online shoppers in danger of payment-card theft, researchers said.Boom! is a wireless provider that resells mobile phone plans from Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile USA, under its own brand and with its own perks (the company boasts \u201cgreat customer service\u201d and no contracts). Up until yesterday, the provider\u2019s main website was hosting malicious code, which lurked on the online checkout page and harvested online shoppers\u2019 details.Click to Register!The approach is reminiscent of core Magecart group attacks, but in this case, the attack was the work of the Fullz House group, according to Malwarebytes, which is a Magecart splinter group that\u2019s mainly known for its phishing prowess.\u201cMost victims of Magecart-based attacks tend to be typical online shops selling various goods. However, every now and again we come across different types of businesses which were affected simply because they happened to be vulnerable,\u201d Malwarebytes researchers said in a Monday post.According to a review from Sucuri, boom[.]us was running PHP version 5.6.40, which reached end-of-life in January 2019. As of this writing, the website still has outdated status.\u201cThis may have been a point of entry but any other vulnerable plugin could also have been abused by attackers to inject malicious code into the website,\u201d researchers pointed out.The AttackThe cybercriminals managed to inject malicious code into Boom!\u2019s web platform, researchers explained.\u201cOur crawlers recently detected that their website, boom[.]us, had been injected with a one-liner that contains a Base64 encoded URL loading an external JavaScript library,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cOnce decoded, the URL loads a fake Google Analytics script from paypal-debit[.]com/cdn/ga.js. We quickly recognize this code as a credit-card skimmer that checks for input fields and then exfiltrates the data to the criminals.\u201dThe skimmer is highly detectable, because it exfiltrates data every time it detects a change in the fields displayed on the page \u2013 i.e., whenever someone types something in. As a result, it lacks stealth: \u201cFrom a network traffic point of view, you can see each leak as a single GET request where the data is Base64 encoded,\u201d explained the researchers.In this case, both the exfiltration domain (hosted on Alibaba) and the injected code proved to be familiar; they have turned up in previous Fullz House incidents, including one where the threat actors were using decoy payment portals set up like phishing pages.Fullz House Back on the ScheduleThe group has been analyzed in the past, and gets its name from the use of carding sites to resell \u201cfullz,\u201d an underground slang term meaning a full set of an individual\u2019s personally identifying information plus financial data.Fullz House was discovered ramping up activity starting in August-September of 2019. It uses a unique codebase and different tactics from the main Magecart variants to carry out its attacks, according to researchers.Magecart\u00a0is an umbrella term encompassing several different threat groups who all use the same modus operandi: They compromise websites (mainly built on the Magento e-commerce platform) in order to inject card-skimming scripts on checkout pages, stealing unsuspecting customers\u2019 payment card details and other information entered into the fields on the page.According to a previous analysis from RiskIQ, Fullz House is known for innovating when it comes to the Magecart blueprint by adding phishing to the mix. It uses generic phishing to gather and sell personal information, for which they have a dedicated store called \u201cBlueMagicStore.\u201d In the web-skimming arena, the group is harvesting financial data during e-commerce checkouts, and selling credit-card information on its carding store, which is named \u201cCardHouse.\u201dBoom! is certainly not the group\u2019s only target: \u201cIn late September, we noticed a number of new domains that were registered and following the same pattern we had seen before with this group,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cHowever, this group was quite active in the summer and continues on a well-established pattern seen a year ago.\u201dOn October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered an attack on the Voice over LTE (VoLTE) mobile communications protocol that can break its encryption and allow attackers to listen in on phone calls.Dubbed ReVoLTE, the attack \u2014 detailed by a group of academic researchers from Ruhr University Bochum and New York University Abu Dhabi \u2014 exploits an implementation flaw in the LTE cellular protocol that exists at the level of a mobile base station. ReVoLTE makes use of a predictable keystream reuse, a scenario in encryption in which stream ciphers, or encryption keys, are vulnerable to attack if the same key is used in a predictable fashion.can allow threat actors to recover the contents of an encrypted VoLTE call.\u201cEventually, the keystream reuse allows an adversary to decrypt a recorded call with minimal resources,\u201d researchers David Rupprecht, Katharina Kohls, Thorsten Holz and Christina P\u00f6pper wrote, in a\u00a0paper detailing the attack.\u201dThe attack is novel in that standard cellular protocols typically aren\u2019t targeted for hacking because researchers \u201cnever have the energy to deal with\u201d the legwork involved of untangling the pages of documentation about the standard itself, according to cryptographer and Johns Hopkins University Professor Matthew Green.\u201cMoreover, implementing the attacks requires researchers to mess with gnarly radio protocols,\u201d he wrote in a blog post about the research. \u201cAnd so, serious cryptographic vulnerabilities can spread all over the world, presumably only exploited by governments, before a researcher actually takes a look at them.\u201dEvery now and then, however, there\u2019s an exception, and ReVoLTE is one of them, he said.How ReVoLTE WorksThe attack leverages the use of encryption at the mobile cell tower, by sniffing the encrypted radio traffic of a call someone makes within the cell of a base station that uses vulnerable encryption methods, researchers wrote.Shortly after this attack, the attacker can call the person who made the call that was compromised, and engage him or her in conversation. This allows the attack to sniff the encrypted radio traffic of that phone call, and record the unencrypted sound. The call needs to be made using the same base station that has vulnerable encryption, researchers noted.The attacker can then compare the two calls and break the encryption, which allows them to recover the previous conversation between the victim and another person. However, the attacker needs to keep the victim on the phone for as long as the length of a targeted call if the entire conversation is to be decrypted, researchers noted.\u201cThe longer he/she talked to the victim, the more content of the previous communication he/she can decrypt,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor example, if the attacker and victim spoke for five minutes, the attacker could later decode five minutes of the previous conversation.\u201dResearchers said they conducted real-world tests of the method on carrier base stations and found that it affects multiple mobile operators. They have notified the carriers of the vulnerability through the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program of the GSM Association (GSMA), which oversees and maintains global telephony standards.\u201cBy the time of publication, those vendors should have provided patches, and providers are requested to install and configure them securely,\u201d researchers noted, adding that they tested German mobile operators who installed the patch to ensure the fix functions properly.However, given the \u201clarge number of providers worldwide and their large deployments,\u201d the team hopes to raise awareness of the vulnerability so the issue can be resolved globally, researchers added.It\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

        "raw text": "A mobile spearphishing attack targeting \u201ca small number of employees\u201d is what led to the unprecedented, major attack earlier in the month on high-profile Twitter accounts to push out a Bitcoin scam.The company posted an update late Thursday on the situation, which has been unfolding since July 15, when 130 accounts of high-profile users such as Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Apple and Uber each were hijacked at the same time to promote a bogus advance-fee cryptocurrency deal.\u201cThis attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees, and exploit human vulnerabilities, to gain access to our internal systems,\u201d the company said in its update. \u201cThis was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service.\u201dOn the day of the attack, Twitter revealed that the accounts fell victim to a compromise of the company\u2019s internal systems by a group of unidentified hackers that managed to access Twitter company tools and secure employee privileges. Until Thursday, Twitter had not yet confirmed exactly how attackers got access to those internal tools, a point that the company has now clarified.The attack required threat actors to obtain access to both Twitter\u2019s internal network via specific employee credentials, the company said Thursday.Since not all of the employees that were initially targeted had permissions to use the account management tools key to the attack, the attackers used a two-step approach to hack their way in, according to Twitter. First they used the initial credentials they phished to access some of Twitter\u2019s internal systems and learn information about company processes, according to the post.\u201cThis knowledge then enabled them to target additional employees who did have access to our account-support tools,\u201d the company said. \u201cUsing the credentials of employees with access to these tools, the attackers targeted 130 Twitter accounts, ultimately tweeting from 45, accessing the [direct messages (DM)] inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of seven.\u201dAn elected official in the Netherlands was one of those whose DMs (direct messages) were leaked; however, attackers did not access data for any of the former U.S. elected officials whose accounts were breached, the company said.Once it was aware of the attack, Twitter immediately locked down thousands of verified accounts belonging to elite Twitter users and high-profile companies to try to prevent hackers from perpetrating the scam. The attack involved sending tweets from each of the hijacked accounts to promote a bogus Bitcoin deal, which promised to double the value of Bitcoin currency sent to one specific wallet.Twitter acknowledged Thursday that there has been \u201cconcern following this incident around our tools and levels of employee access,\u201d and said that it\u2019s taking steps and updating its account tools to make them more \u201csophisticated\u201d to prevent such a breach in the future.Those steps include significantly limiting access to internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while the company completes its investigation. This unfortunately will result in some disruption of user account service, including limiting access to the Twitter Data download feature and other processes, Twitter acknowledged.\u201cWe will be slower to respond to account support needs, reported tweets and applications to our developer platform,\u201d the company said in the update. \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for any delays this causes, but we believe it\u2019s a necessary precaution as we make durable changes to our processes and tooling as a result\u00a0 of this incident.\u201dThe company continues to investigate the attack and work with \u201cappropriate authorities\u201d to identify and those responsible. In the meantime, there continues to be widespread speculation and reported evidence about who may be behind the hack, but no solid conclusions.Some of the strongest evidence about the potential perpetrators was published in a number of reports pointing to the sale of Twitter account access by hackers obsessed with so-called \u201cOG handles,\u201d which are short-character profile names that confer a measure of status and wealth in certain online communities.Another plausible theory also emerged around screenshots of Twitter\u2019s internal tools that appeared on underground forums ahead of the attacks due to a bribe of a lone rogue Twitter employee, but Twitter later refuted this claim.The FBI is said to be taking the lead in the investigation due to the massive privacy, legislative and business ramifications of the incident.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "The U.S. government has slapped sanctions on virtual currency mixer Tornado Cash for laundering more than $7 billion in crypto cash derived from cybercriminal activity. At least $455 million of that was moved for state-sponsored Lazarus Group in part to help fund North Korea\u2019s missile program, officials said.The U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) unveiled the action\u2014which basically freezes all of the assets and business of Tornado Cash and prohibits anyone from doing business with the service\u2013on Monday, citing a number of occasions that the service laundered crypto for hackers. The website of the service already has been taken offline and any transaction having to do with the service or anyone affiliated with it is now blocked within the United States.\na blog post published Thursday.In addition to the hefty sum that prolific North Korean-based Lazarus has moved through the service, Tornado Cash also laundered more than $96 million of cybercriminal funds derived from the June 24 theft of cryptocurrency from the Horizon blockchain bridge from Harmony, and at least $7.8 million from an Aug. 2 attack that stole $190 million from the Nomad crypto firm, U.S. officials said.The move to sanction Tornado Cash for Lazarus\u2019 activities on the exchange is an integral part of the White House\u2019s response to North Korea\u2019s use of cyber warfare against cryptocurrency exchanges to finance its missile program, a senior administration official said, according to a tweet from Politico cybersecurity reporter Eric Geller.Indeed, Lazarus is well-known in cybersecurity circles as a financially motivated advanced persistent threat (APT) aimed at stealing cash as well as performing cyberespionage activities for the regime of Kim Jong-un. The OFAC already sanctioned the group and all its sub-entities in 2019 for their various cybercriminal actions to support North Korea\u2019s weapons programs.Warning UnheededThe sanctions against Tornado Cash come after its operators were warned about the illegal activity occurring on the exchange, which the feds have been monitoring, according to the Department of Treasury.Indeed, the government has in general been keeping a close eye on so-called crypto mixers and will continue to do so in the future, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson said. These services, which allow anonymous users to transfer various types of crypto, are frequented by cybercriminals to move payments from ransomware attacks and other illicit actions.\u201cDespite public assurances otherwise, Tornado Cash has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors on a regular basis and without basic measures to address its risks,\u201d Nelson said in a press statement.Tornado Cash operates on the Ethereum blockchain and facilitates anonymous transactions by obfuscating their origin, destination and other parties involved, and has no interest in knowing where the money is coming from, according to the Treasury Department.The service receives a variety of transactions and mixes them together before transmitting them to their individual recipients. While Tornado Cash purports to maintain anonymity for users for privacy purposes, this also and quite conveniently makes it easy for cybercriminals\u2014particularly ones pulling off heists of significant sums of money\u2014to hide their activity.Lazarus has been active since at least 2009 and is considered by government officials and security researchers alike to be one of the world\u2019s most prolific threats. The group possesses a variety of advanced malware, ransomware and other tools in its bag of tricks, and changes up tactics and targets frequently to keep law enforcement on its toes.Hacks",

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals are tapping the built-in services of popular messaging apps like Telegram and Discord as ready-made platforms to help them perform their nefarious activity in persistent campaigns that threaten users, researchers have found.Threat actors are tapping the multi-feature nature of messaging apps\u2014in particularly their content-creation and program-sharing components\u2014as a foundation for info-stealing, according to new research from Intel 471.Specifically, they use the apps \u201cto host, distribute, and execute various functions that ultimately allow them to steal credentials or other information from unsuspecting users,\u201d researchers wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.\u201cWhile messaging apps like Discord and Telegram are not primarily used for business operations, their popularity coupled with the rise in remote work means a cybercriminal has a bigger attack surface at their disposal than in past years,\u201d researchers wrote.Intel 471 identified three key ways in which threat actors are leveraging built-in features of popular messaging apps for their own gain: storing stolen data, hosting malware payloads, and using bots that perform their dirty work, they said.Storing Exfiltrated DataHaving one\u2019s own dedicated and secure network to store data stolen from unsuspecting victims of cybercrime can be costly and time-consuming. Instead, threat actors are using data-storage features of Discord and Telegram as repositories for info-stealers that actually depend upon the apps for this aspect of functionality, researchers have found.Indeed, novel malware dubbed Ducktail that steals data from Facebook Business users was recently seen storing exfiltrated data in a Telegram channel, and it\u2019s far from the only one.Researchers from Intel 471 observed a bot known as X-Files that uses bot commands inside Telegram to steal and store data, they said. Once the malware infects a system, threat actors can swipe passwords, session cookies, login credentials and credit-card details from popular browsers\u2013 including Google Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Slimjet and Vivaldi\u2013and then deposit that stolen info \u201cinto a Telegram channel of their choosing,\u201d researchers said.Another stealer known as Prynt Stealer functions in a similar fashion, but does not have the built-in Telegram commands, they added.Other stealers use Discord as their messaging platform of choice for storing stolen data. One stealer observed by Intel 471, known as Blitzed Grabber, uses Discord\u2019s webhooks feature to deposit data lifted by the malware, including autofill data, bookmarks, browser cookies, VPN client credentials, payment card information, cryptocurrency wallets and passwords, researchers said. Webhooks are similar to APIs in that they simplify the transmission of automated messages and data updates from a victim\u2019s machine to a particular messaging channel.Blitzed Grabber and two other stealers observed using messaging apps for data storage\u2013\u2014Mercurial Grabber and 44Caliber\u2013also target credentials for the Minecraft and Roblox gaming platforms, researchers added.\u201cOnce the malware spits that stolen information back into Discord, actors can then use it to continue their own schemes or move to sell the stolen credentials on the cybercrime underground,\u201d researchers noted.Payload HostingThreat actors also are leveraging the cloud infrastructure of messaging apps to host more than legitimate services\u2014they also hide malware in its depths, according to Intel 471.Discord\u2019s content delivery network (CDN) has been an especially fertile ground for malware hosting since as far back as 2019 because cybercrime operators farce no restrictions when uploading their malicious payloads there for file hosting, researchers noted.\u201cThe links are open to any users without authentication, giving threat actors a highly reputable web domain to host malicious payloads,\u201d researchers wrote.Malware families observed using Discord CDN to host malicious payloads include: PrivateLoader, Colibri, Warzone RAT, Smokeloader, Agent Tesla stealer and njRAT, among others.Using Bots for FraudCybercriminals also are empowering Telegram bots to do more than offer legitimate features to users, researchers found. In fact, Intel 471 has observed what it calls an \u201cuptick\u201d in services being flogged on the cybercrime underground that provide access to bots that can intercept one-time password (OTP) tokens, which threat actors can weaponize to defraud users.One bot known as Astro OTP gives threat actors access to both OTPs and short message service (SMS) verification codes, researchers observed. Cybercriminals can control the bots directly through the Telegram interface by executing simple commands, they said.The current going rate for Astro OTP on hacker forums is US$25 for a one-day subscription or US$300 for a life-time subscription, researchers said.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office.

At its core is what\u2019s called a Universal Data Connector, which allows the \u201cmovement and transformation of data for critical business processes like machine learning, data mining, reporting and data visualization,\u201d according to the OAS website.The OAS Platform is widely used in systems in which a range of disparate devices and software need to communicate, which is why it\u2019s often found in ICS to connect industrial and IoT devices, SCADA systems, network points, and custom apps and APIs, among other software and hardware. Some companies using the platform include Intel, Mack Trucks, the U.S. Navy, JBT AeroTech and Michelin.Critical Infrastructure at RiskThe OAS Platform\u2019s presence in these systems is why the flaws can be incredibly dangerous, observed one security professional, noting that these devices are often those responsible for the operation of highly sensitive processes involved in critical industries like utilities and manufacturing.\u201cAn attacker with the ability to disrupt or alter the function of those devices can inflict catastrophic damage on critical infrastructure facilities,\u201d Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at security firm Cerberus Sentinel, wrote in an email to Threatpost.What can be especially dangerous in ICS attacks is that they may not be immediately obvious, which can make them hard to detect and allow them to inflict significant damage while operators are none the wiser, he said.Clements cited the now-infamous Stuxnet worm that propagated more than 10 years ago as an example of how much destruction an ICS threat can cause if it flies under the radar.Stuxnet \u201cwas a case study on these risks, as it didn\u2019t immediately break the industrial control devices it targeted but altered their function in such a way to cause critical industrial components to eventually catastrophically fail, all while falsely reporting back to monitoring systems that everything was operating normally,\u201d he said.\u00a0The VulnerabilitiesOf the flaws in OAS discovered by Cisco Talos, the one with the most critical rating on the CVSS (9.4) is being tracked as CVE-2022-26833, or TALOS-2022-1513. It\u2019s an improper authentication flaw in the REST API in OAS which could allow an attacker to send a series of HTTP requests to gain unauthenticated use of the API, researchers said.However, what\u2019s being deemed by researchers as the most serious of the flaws earned a 9.1 rating on the CVSS and is being tracked as CVE-2022-26082, or TALOS-2022-1493. CVE-2022-26082 is a file write vulnerability in the OAS Engine SecureTransferFiles functionality that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine through a specially-crafted series of network requests.The other vulnerabilities that Cisco Talos discovered earned ratings of high severity. The flaw that could lead to DoS is being tracked as CVE-2022-26026 or TALOS-2022-1491, and is found in the OAS Engine SecureConfigValues functionality of the platform. It can allow an attacker to create a specially-crafted network request that can lead to loss of communications.Two other vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-27169 or TALOS-2022-1494 and CVE-2022-26067 or TALOS-2022-1492, can allow an attacker to obtain a directory listing at any location permissible by the underlying user by sending a specific network request, researchers wrote.Another information disclosure vulnerability tracked as CVE-2022-26077 or TALOS-2022-1490, works in the same way, researchers said. However, this flaw also provides the attacker with a list of usernames and passwords for the platform that could be used in future attacks, they said.The other two vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to make external configuration changes, including the ability to create a new security group and/or new user accounts arbitrarily on the platform. They are being tracked as CVE-2022-26303 or TALOS-2022-1488, and CVE-2022-26043 or TALOS-2022-1489.Updates Urged, but May Take TimeCisco Talos worked with OAS to resolve the issues and urged those affected to update as soon as possible. Affected users also can mitigate the flaws by ensuring that proper network segmentation is in place which will give adversaries a low level of access to the network on which the OAS Platform communicates, researchers noted.Although updating systems is the best way to protect against potential attacks when vulnerabilities exist, it\u2019s not often a quick and easy task, especially for ICS operators, security experts noted.In fact, due to the nature of the systems, it\u2019s an \u201cimmensely disruptive\u201d task to take industrial systems offline, which is why ICS patches are often delayed for months or years, Clements said.Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "A server-side request forgery (SSRF) flaw in an API of a large financial technology (fintech) platform potentially could have compromised millions of bank customers, allowing attackers to defraud clients by controlling their bank accounts and funds, researchers have found.A team at Salt Security\u2019s Salt Labs identified the vulnerability in an API in a web page that supports the organization\u2019s platform fund transfer functionality, which allows clients to transfer money from their accounts on its platform into their bank accounts, researchers disclosed in a report published Thursday.The company in question\u2014dubbed \u201cAcme Fintech\u201d to preserve its anonymity\u2013offers a \u201cdigital transformation\u201d service for banks of all sizes, allowing the institutions to switch traditional banking services to online services. The platform already has been actively integrated into many banks\u2019 systems and thus has millions of active daily users, researchers said.If the flaw had been exploited, attackers could have performed various nefarious activities by gaining administrative access to the banking system using the platform. From there they could have leaked users\u2019 personal data, accessed banking details and financial transactions, and performed unauthorized fund transfers into their own bank accounts, researchers said.Upon identifying the vulnerability, researchers reviewed their findings and provided recommended mitigation to the organization, they said.High Reward for Threat ActorsAPI flaws are often overlooked, but researchers at Salt Labs said in the report that they \u201csee vulnerabilities like this one and other API-related issues on a daily basis.\u201dIndeed, 5 percent of organizations experienced an API security incident in the past 12 months, according to the company\u2019s State of API Security report for the first quarter of 2022. This period also showed significant growth of malicious API traffic, they said.\u201cCritical SSRF flaws are more common than many FinTech providers and banking institutions realize,\u201d Yaniv Balmas, vice president of research for Salt Security said in a press statement. \u201cAPI attacks are becoming more frequent and complex.\u201dFintech companies are especially vulnerable to compromise because their customers and partners rely on a vast network of APIs to drive interactions between various websites, mobile applications and custom integrations, among other systems, researchers said.This, in turn, makes them \u201cprime targets by attackers looking to abuse API vulnerabilities\u201d for a couple of reasons, researchers wrote.\u201cOne, their API landscape and overall functionality is very rich and complex, which leaves a lot of room for mistakes or overlooking\u00a0 details in development,\u201d they wrote. \u201cTwo, if a bad actor can successfully abuse this type of platform, the potential profits are huge, since it could allow control of millions of users\u2019 bank accounts and funds.\u201dThe VulnerabilityResearchers discovered the flaw while scanning and recording all traffic sent and received across the organization\u2019s website. On a page that connects clients to various banks so they can transfer funds to their bank accounts, researchers discovered an issue with the API the browser calls to handle the request.\u201cThis specific API is using the endpoint located at \u2018/workflows/tasks/{TASK_GUID}/values,\u2019 the HTTP method used to call it is\nPUT, and the specific request data is sent in the HTTP body section,\u201d researchers explained.The request body also carries a JWT Bearer token, which is a cryptographically signed key that lets the server know who is the requesting user and what permissions he has.The flaw was in the request parameters that send the required data for a funds transfer\u2014specifically a parameter called \u201cInstitutionURL,\u201d researchers explained. This is a user-provided value that includes a URL pointing to some GUID value placed on the receiving bank website.In this case, the bank\u2019s web server handled the user-supplied URL by trying to contact the URL itself, allowing for a SSRF in which the web server still tried to call an arbitrary URL if it was inserted into the code instead of the appropriate bank\u2019s URL, researchers explained.Exposing the SSRF FlawResearchers demonstrated this flaw by forging a malformed request containing their own domain. The connection coming into their server was made successfully, proving that \u201cthe server blindly trusts domains provided to it in this parameter and issues a request to that URL,\u201d they wrote.Further, the request that came into their server included a JWT token used for authentication, which turned out to be a different one than the token included in the original request.Researchers embedded the new JWT token into a request they\u2019d previously encountered to an endpoint named \u201c/accounts/account,\u201d which had allowed them to retrieve information from a bank account. This time they returned even more information, they said.\u201cThe API endpoint recognized our new JWT administrative token and very gracefully returned a list of every user and its details across the platform,\u201d researchers revealed.Trying the request again to an endpoint named \u201c/transactions/transactions\u201d with the new token also allowed them to access a list of all transactions made by every user on the banking system, they said.\u201cThis vulnerability is a critical flaw, one that completely compromises every bank user,\u201d researchers said. \u201cHad bad actors discovered this vulnerability, they could have caused serious damage for both [the organization] and its users.\u201dSalt Labs hopes that shining a light on API threats will inspire security practitioners to take a closer look at how their systems may be vulnerable in this way, Balmas said.Vulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Wormhole \u2013 a web-based blockchain \u201cbridge\u201d that enables users to convert cryptocurrencies \u2013 said on Thursday that \u201call funds are safe\u201d after attackers abused a vulnerability to shake it down for 120,000 Ethereum (approximately $314 million).The popular bridge, which connects Ethereum (ETH), the Solana blockchain (SOL) and more, has reportedly been trying to negotiate on-chain with the attacker since Wednesday\u2019s attack. The exploit was reportedly the fourth-largest crypto-heist ever, the biggest of 2022 so far, and the biggest one that Solana has faced yet.In a postmortem shared with Threatpost on Thursday, blockchain security and smart-auditing company CertiK said that its preliminary analysis indicates that \u201cthe attacker exploited a mint function on the Solana side of the Wormhole bridge to create 120,000 wETH [wrapped Ethereum] for themselves, then used these minted tokens to claim ETH that was held on the Ethereum side of the bridge.\u201dAs far as negotiation attempts go, CertiK said that the Wormhole team left a message to the attacker stating, \u201cWe noticed you were able to exploit the Solana VAA verification and mint tokens. We\u2019d like to offer you a white-hat agreement, and present you a bug bounty of $10 million for exploit details, and return the wETH you\u2019ve minted. You can reach out to us at contact@certus.one.\u201dIts total on the heist differs a bit from that of Wormhole: CertiK\u2019s analysis showed that the attacker got away with 93,750 ETH ($251 million), 432,662 SOL ($46.6 million) and 4.14 million in USD Coin (USDC) ($4.14 million), for a total of $302,495,717.This is the second-largest hack of a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, second only to the Poly Network (ETH) exploit, in which an attacker ripped off about $602 million. That attacker reportedly went on to pay it back, however, after accepting a gig as chief security advisor with Poly Network.In an early-morning tweet on Thursday, the official Wormhole Twitter account confirmed that it had been raided for 120,000 ETH, but that the vulnerability is now patched.1/2All funds have been restored and Wormhole is back up.We're deeply grateful for your support and thank you for your patience.\u2014 Wormhole\ud83c\udf2a (@wormholecrypto) February 3, 2022Wormhole\u2019s Portal \u2013 its token bridge \u2013 was back up as of 13:29 UTC, the team said.A \u2018Rather Common\u2019 Programming ErrorRoger Grimes, data driven defense evangelist for KnowBe4, told Threatpost on Thursday that the attack was successful because of what he called a \u201crather common\u201d programming error.\u201cThe function inside of the multiple nested smart contracts which was supposed to verify the signature was not coded to ensure the integrity check actually happened,\u201d he exlained via email. \u201cSo there was no integrity guaranteed in the integrity check. Yeah, that is a problem.\u201dWhy So Popular?CertiK said that the bridge\u2019s popularity meant that it had become the dominant bridge between Solana and Ethereum, \u201cand as such was responsible for a large proportion of all wrapped Ethereum on the Solana blockchain.\u201d020322 14:54 UPDATE: Added CertiK\u2019s analysis of Wormhole\u2019s 1:1 ratio of ETH to wETH.\u00a0As CertiK explained in its postmortem, the bridge held a 1:1 ratio of ETH to wETH, \u201cacting essentially as an escrow service.\u201d But the theft broke that 1:1 peg, leading to what CertiK said was \u201cat least 93,750 less ETH held as collateral.\u201dIt didn\u2019t bode well for the financial health of Solana, the firm pointed out. If that ratio hadn\u2019t been\u00a0 regained, DeFi on Solana was at risk of \u201ca mass liquidation event,\u201d according to the its analysis.But given that Wormhole on Thursday indicated that its backers \u2013 whoever they may be \u2013 had put up the funds necessary to return the peg to a 1:1 backing, the collateralization of wETH on Solana was restored.\u00a0All well and good, but still, investors\u2019 gonads shrunk in response to the massive heist: The price of Solana, which outpaced both Bitcoin and Ethereum last year, was in freefall Thursday morning. It was selling at $97.69 as of 12:50 ET, down 10 percent since the details of the theft were revealed. Solana had hit a high of $260 in November 2021. Ethereum is also giving investors the hives, having dropped about 5 percent as of the same time on Thursday.At this point, the full extent of this attack \u201cstill remains to be seen,\u201d CertiK said. It could turn out to be a precursor to other attacks, the firm suggested, if, for example, Wormhole\u2019s bridge to a different cryptocurrency \u2013 the Terra blockchain \u2013 shares the same vulnerability as its Solana bridge.Who Bailed Out Wormhole?The Wormhole team didn\u2019t specify who dug into what must be some seriously deep pockets to back-fill all that money. The Twitterverse, of course, had hypotheses, including that perhaps it was Alameda Research: a cryptocurrency quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider that claims to \u201cmanage over $70 million in digital assets and trade around $1 billion per day across thousands of products: all major coins and altcoins, and their derivatives.\u201d\u201cIt was either dilute their equity to infinity with $300 million bail out or watch all of Solana ecosystem crash and burn (which would have costed Alameda more than $300 million on their books),\u201d suggested one Twitter user.Alameda probably bailed them out, it was either dilute their equity to infinity with $300 million bail out or watch all of Solana ecosystem crash and burn (which would have costed Alameda more than $300 million on their books)\u2014 ichioku (@1chioku) February 3, 2022Alameda hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the matter. Wormhole has promised a detailed incident report as soon as possible.Crypto\u2019s Cutting Edge Gets a Nasty CutRonghui Gu, co-founder and professor of CertiK, told Threatpost on Thursday that clearly this Wormhole exploit isn\u2019t the first of its kind, and obviously, it won\u2019t be the last.\u201cWe saw another cross-chain bridge exploited less than a week ago, when Qubit Finance lost $80 million,\u201d Gu pointed out, referring to an attack confirmed by the DeFi protocol Qubit Finance on Friday.The attackers reportedly made off with 206,809 Binance coins through Qubit\u2019s QBridge deposit function, making it the seventh-largest DeFi hack ever.Expect more of the same when it comes to bridge exploits, Gu said, given insatiable demand for these technologies. \u201cWe seem to be at an awkward point where the demand for cross-chain infrastructure is far outpacing the industry\u2019s ability to build services securely,\u201d he told Threatpost via email.Of course, there\u2019s always the \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the money is\u201d rationale, Gu noted: \u201cBridges are an attractive target for hackers: they hold millions of dollars of tokens in what is essentially an escrow contract, and by operating across multiple chains they multiply their potential points of failure.\u201dThreat actors follow the money, he said, and those on the cutting edge of cryptocurrency technology can get bumped off as a result: \u201cA lot of money goes to the newest, most exciting ecosystems. The price that the most adventurous DeFi explorers pay is a heightened risk of falling victim to these exploits of innovative but ultimately insecure platforms.\u201dA Need for Secure Development LifecycleWhere there is software, there are bugs. Grimes pointed to the attack as being a case in point about the need for training in secure development lifecycle (SDL) coding. \u201cSDL teaches developers about common exploitable bugs and how to avoid putting it into their own code,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt teaches about using bug checking tools, using coding tools that automatically rule out as many security bugs as they can, and in general, puts security into the whole lifecycle of developing something, be it a traditional program, smart phone app or smart contract.\u201dBut there\u2019s a\u00a0 bigger underlying problem, he noted: Namely, most developers and smart contract creators, aren\u2019t trained in SDL and \u201cget little to no training in secure development. So, these sorts of bugs are going to creep in and bad actors are going to take advantage of them.\u201dOne thing to note is that the cryptocurrency world is full of trillions of dollars, but it\u2019s still at the toddler stage. \u201cIt is an immature industry using immature code, and like all new industries, it is moving ahead at warp speed, good security be damned,\u201d Grimes said.Whereas it\u2019s getting harder for bad actors and bug hunters to find really good exploits in Microsoft Windows, Macs, Linux and Google ChromeOS, these platforms are maturing, making it tougher to pull them apart, he said. That includes the experienced coders, tools and the protective mechanisms of the operating systems themselves.Not so with the\u00a0 cryptocurrency world, Grimes said, which is the mirror opposite.\u201cIt is built on very secure protocols and algorithms, but then a lot of very immature and buggy applications are built on top of it,\u201d he observed.He compared it to putting your door key in your potted plant in front of the door: \u201cSometimes all a thief has to do is look. And that is what hackers exploiting cryptocurrency are doing. They are taking their traditional methods for hunting bugs and using them against immature cryptocurrency applications. And viola, they are finding lots of exploitable bugs.\u201dAnd once the money\u2019s gone bye-bye, it\u2019s tough to claw it back. \u201cThe exploits always result in stolen money, which are hard to track to and [identify], and almost always impossible to reverse, even if you are watching it in real time,\u201d Grimes said.He predicted that after suffering billions of dollars in pain, the cryptocurrency world \u201cwill mature and it will become harder for hackers to find the easy pickings.\u201dToo bad the lessons are so painful, Grimes said: \u201cYou always hope that when the next cool digital thing happens that we will better apply the security lessons learned from the previous platforms. But we always seem to want there to be more digital blood on the ground than there needs to be. We always, over and over, want to learn the hard way. Each new computing platform is like we have learned nothing at all.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.HacksVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "UPDATEFour vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams, unpatched since March, allowed link spoofing of URLs and opened the door to DoS attacks against Android users, researchers said.Researchers from Positive Security discovered four bugs in the feature earlier this year and told Microsoft about the issues on March 10. So far, only one of the bugs\u2014a bug allowing attackers to leak Android IP addresses\u2014appears to have been patched by the company, researcher Fabian Br\u00e4unlein said in a blog post published Wednesday.In a statement to Threatpost, Microsoft said the reported bugs do not pose an immediate threat to users.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve investigated all four reports and have concluded that they do not pose immediate threats requiring a security fix. We\u2019ve received similar reports in the past and have made several recent improvements to the handling of data and security in general. These changes block the reproduction of several of these reports, including the reported IP address leak on Android issue,\u201d according to Microsoft.Microsoft Teams is a collaboration tool that helps people working in different geographic locations work together online. For this reason, Teams usage of the platform has risen during the pandemic, making it an increasingly attractive target for threat actors.Positive Security researchers \u201cstumbled upon\u201d the vulnerabilities when they were looking for a way to bypass Teams\u2019 Electron\u2019s Same-Origin Policy (SOP), he wrote in the report. SOP is security mechanism of browsers that aims to prevent websites from attacking each other.Researchers discovered that one potential way to bypass the SOP in Teams is to abuse the link preview feature by letting the client generate a link preview for the target page, and then using the summary text or performing optical character recognition (OCR) on the preview image to extract information.\u201cIn Teams, this preview is actually generated server-side by Microsoft,\u201d something that\u2019s possible because there is no end-to-end encryption present, Br\u00e4unlein explained. This means that the feature cannot be abused to leak information from the user\u2019s local network\u2014e.g., the Node.js debug server, he said.\u201cHowever, while investigating this feature, I stumbled upon a few unrelated vulnerabilities in its implementation,\u201d Br\u00e4unlein said.Bug BreakdownTwo of the four bugs discovered affected Microsoft Teams being used on any device and allow for server-side request forgery (SSRF) and spoofing, researchers said. The other two\u2014dubbed \u201cIP Address Leak\u201d and \u201cDenial of Service aka Message of Death\u201d by researchers\u2014affect only Android users.The SSRF vulnerability allowed researchers to leak information from Microsoft\u2019s local network and was discovered when Br\u00e4unlein tested the /urlp/v1/url/info endpoint for SSRF, he said.\u201cThe URL is not filtered, leading to a limited SSRF (response time, code, size and open graph data leaked), which can be used for internal portscanning and sending HTTP-based exploits to the discovered web services,\u201d Br\u00e4unlein explained.Attackers can use the spoofing bug to beef up phishing attacks or hide malicious links in content sent to users, he said. This can be done by setting the preview link target \u201cto any location independent of the main link, preview image and description, the displayed hostname or onhover text,\u201d according to the post.To abuse the Android DoS bug, a threat actor can send a message to someone using Teams via its Android app that includes a link preview with an invalid preview link target. This will crash the app continuously when the user tries to open the chat/channel with the malicious message, basically blocking users out of the chat or channel, Br\u00e4unlein explained.Finally, attackers can use IP address leak bug\u2014the only one Microsoft appears to have remedied\u2014to intercept messages that include a link preview to point the thumbnail URL to a non-Microsoft domain. This is possible in link previews in which the backend fetches the referenced preview thumbnail and makes it available from a Microsoft domain, Br\u00e4unlein said.\u201cThe Android client does not check the domain/does not have a CSP restricting the allowed domains and loads the thumbnail image from any domain,\u201d he explained.Microsoft\u2019s ResponseMicrosoft first responded to Positive Security on March 12, two days after its disclosure, and the two parties went \u201cback-and-forth\u201d for a couple of weeks on details of the spoofing issue.Between March 25 and April 14, the company responded conclusively to each of the individual issues raised and eventually gave researchers the go-ahead to reveal its findings publicly, according to the post. Microsoft Wednesday did not immediately return request for comment on Positive Security\u2019s report. However, on Thursday it issued a statement to Threatpost asserting the issues outlined by Positive Security didn\u2019t require an immediate patch and that steps had been taken to tighten security in Teams.On March 25, the company decided not to patch the DoS and SSRF bugs, according to Br\u00e4unlein. Microsoft said it determined that the DoS bug \u201cdoes not require immediate security service\u201d because it is of \u00a0\u201clow severity for temporary DoS that requires restart of application,\u201d according to the post. Microsoft added that it would consider fixing the issue in a later version of the product.In terms of the SSRF bug, Microsoft gave no reasoning for closing the case without a patch, saying only that the company \u201cwill not be fixing this vulnerability in the current version,\u201d according to Positive Security.Microsoft also declined to patch the Android IP address leak on April 4, determining that the issue \u201cdoes not pose an immediate threat that requires urgent attention due to the general data sensitivity of the IP address data.\u201dThe company did, however, share the report with the team responsible for the product, and a retest of all the bugs that Positive Security conducted on Dec. 15 demonstrated that the issue appears to have been patched, Br\u00e4unlein wrote.On April 14, Microsoft also declined to address the URL spoofing issue, concluding that it also does not pose an immediate threat \u201cbecause once the user clicks on the URL, they would have to go to that malicious URL which would be a giveaway that it\u2019s not the one the user was expecting,\u201d according to Positive Security.(This article was updated 12/23/2021 at 9:45 am ET with a comment from Microsoft)\u00a0Vulnerabilities",

A recent campaign marks an uptick in attacks against the firm\u2019s platform, which have also included past targeting of Zoho\u2019s ADSelfService Plus.This most recent campaign, reported by Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 this week, dovetails warnings in September by the FBI, CISA and the U.S. Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER) of similar attacks. That targeting included an unspecified APT exploiting a then zero-day vulnerability in Zoho\u2019s password management solution called ADSelfService Plus.According to researchers, the APT shifted its focus to organizations running Zoho\u2019s ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus. The recent attacks expand the number of recent Zoho victims impacted by the APT from nine to 13.\nIn the Unit 42 report, authored by Robert Falcone and Peter Renals, researchers said the most recent activity was tracked between late October and November. During that time, attackers began reconnaissance efforts against a U.S. financial organization running a vulnerable version of ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus, they wrote.\u201cIn the days that followed, we observed similar activity across six other organizations, with exploitation against one U.S. defense organization and one tech organization beginning as early as Nov. 3,\u201d researchers said.Unit 42 is now tracking the two active attack fronts against Zoho\u2019s ManageEngine as the \u201cTitledTemple\u201d campaign and have evidence to believe that the attackers are from China, though \u201cattribution is still ongoing,\u201d the researchers said.Back in November, Unit 42 said it observed correlations between the tactics and tooling used in ADSelfService Plus campaigns and Threat Group 3390, also known as TG-3390 and Emissary Panda or APT27.Findings by Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center\u2019s (MSTIC) tied the September Zoho attacks targeting its ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus also suspect threat actor DEV-0322 is behind the campaign. The advanced persistent threat group operates out of China, according Microsoft threat researchers.Unpatched ServiceDesk Plus Installs Under AttackOn Nov. 22, Zoho released a security advisory alerting customers of active exploitation against newly registered CVE-2021-44077 found in Manage Engine ServiceDesk Plus, a help desk and asset management software.The vulnerability, which allows for unauthenticated remote code execution, impacts ServiceDesk Plus versions 11305 and below. Unit 42 researchers believe that attackers have been exploiting this bug in unpatched versions, though they have not found any publicly available proof of concept code for an exploit.Researchers also have observed the APT uploading a new dropper to the victim systems that, similar to the ADSelfService attacks, deploys a Godzilla webshell, they said. This \u201cprovides the actor with further access to and persistence in compromised systems,\u201d researchers said.However, though attackers used the same webshell secret key \u2013 5670ebd1f8f3f716 \u2013 in both TiltedTemple attacks, the Godzilla webshell used in the ServiceDesk Plus attack observed by researchers was not a single Java Server Pages (JSP) file, which was seen before.Instead, the webshell was installed as an Apache Tomcat Java Servlet Filter, which allow for the filtering of inbound requests or outbound responses. \u201cIn this particular case, this allows the actor to filter inbound requests to determine which requests are meant for the webshell,\u201d researchers explained.\u201cIt appears that the threat actor leveraged publicly available code called tomcat-backdoor to build the filter and then added a modified Godzilla webshell to it,\u201d researchers wrote, adding that the use of a publicly available tool with documentation written in Chinese fits in with the profile of the actor that researchers already had observed.This change also signifies a couple of things for the tactic used in the attacks, they said. The fact that the Godzilla webshell is installed as a filter means that there is no specific URL that the actor will send their requests to when interacting with the webshell, researchers explained. Additionally, the Godzilla webshell filter also can bypass a security filter that is present in ServiceDesk Plus to stop access to webshell files, they said.Over Half of Internet-Connected Installs VulnerableResearchers used Xpanse capabilities to discover the scope of the problem, finding that there are currently more than 4,700 internet-facing instances of ServiceDesk Plus globally, with 2,900, or 62 percent, vulnerable to exploitation.\u201cIn light of these recent developments, we would advance our characterization of the threat to that of an APT(s) conducting a persistent campaign, and leveraging a variety of initial access vectors, to compromise a diverse set of targets globally,\u201d researchers wrote.So far, organizations that have been attacked comprise multiple sectors, including technology, energy, healthcare, education, finance and defense industries. Of four new victims since the originally discovered campaign\u2014which targeted nine organizations\u2013two were compromised through vulnerable ADSelfService Plus servers while two were compromised through ServiceDesk Plus software, they said.\u201cWe anticipate that this number will climb as the actor continues to conduct reconnaissance activities against these industries and others, including infrastructure associated with five U.S. states,\u201d researchers warned.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "Compound, an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, accidentally gave out $90 million to its users in a botched upgrade. Now, the owners would appreciate it if they gave it back. Compound might even be willing to throw in a 10 percent \u201creward,\u201d it said.On the flip side, those who don\u2019t return the money could be doxxed (i.e., have their private information published online), or be reported to the Internal Revenue Service, Compound\u2019s founder and comptroller Robert Leshner threatened over Twitter.If you received a large, incorrect amount of COMP from the Compound protocol error:Please return it to the Compound Timelock (0x6d903f6003cca6255D85CcA4D3B5E5146dC33925). Keep 10% as a white-hat.Otherwise, it's being reported as income to the IRS, and most of you are doxxed.\u2014 Robert Leshner (@rleshner) October 1, 2021After getting roasted as a \u201closer,\u201d \u201cmoron\u201d and frankly, far worse, Leshner apologized, but the damage seemed to have already been done among the crypto community.\u201cCooperation with the Feds goes against everything crypto stands for,\u201d a user replied to Leshner. \u201cDoxxing people and ratting them out to the IRS, knowing that the agency will use the threat of violence to collect \u2018taxes\u2019 is even worse.\u201dAnother user put it more bluntly in his response to Leshner. \u201cYou torched your trust equity with me,\u201d Mr. Delete Button tweeted. \u201cI won\u2019t be using Compound anymore and will be encouraging everyone I know in the space and who is entering the space to avoid you and your product.\u201dOuch.Leshner said it was all a misunderstanding.\u201cThe tweet was taken out of context \u2014 it meant to suggest that, unlike a black-hat attacker, most of the addresses that had received COMP incorrectly were active users of Coinbase, FTX, Binance, etc., that had their information,\u201d Leshner explained to Threatpost. \u201cThe Compound interface is hosted on IPFS and collects zero user information whatsoever.\u201dJust 24 hours after Leshner\u2019s Sept. 30 tweet, Compound\u2019s native currency token COMP had lost 13 percent of its value, Bleeping Computer noted. According to Coinbase, the price of Compound is down 10.99 percent over the past seven days.\u201cCOMP tokens from the user-incentive pool were misallocated as a result of the bug,\u201d Leshner told Threatpost. He added that 163,000 COMP tokens have been returned and 183,000 are still missing.That means the platform is still missing about $58,528,890 at today\u2019s COMP price.\u201cCommunity developers have submitted a patch to tokenholders to approve, which fixes the underlying issue and resumes the COMP distribution properly,\u201d Leshner said.DeFi Likely to See More Fraud, Attacks \u00a0Just a few weeks ago, fellow DeFi platform PolyNetwork was ripped off for a stunning $610 million. Ultimately, the entire amount was returned by the attacker, dubbed \u201cMr. White Hat\u201d by the PolyNetwork negotiators. They eventually offered Mr. White Hat a job as PolyNetwork\u2019s chief security officer to recoup the stolen cryptocurrency.Mr. White Hat turned down the gig and instead said the breach was intended as a security lesson for the DeFi community.Cream Finance DeFi platform was also hit by attackers over the past several weeks and robbed of $29 million in Amp coin.The big difference with the Compound situation is that no crime was committed. PolyNetworks and Cream Finance were victims of cybercrime. Compound just mistakenly gave the crypto away.\u201cUnlike other recent losses of cryptocurrency, this was not due to hacking or criminal activity,\u201d Jake Williams with BreachQuest told Threatpost. \u201cIn this case, the root cause was a bug introduced in a software upgrade.\u201dHe added the threat to dox users was a bit \u201coverboard.\u201d\u201cWhile Leshner walked that back, it\u2019s hard to see how that doesn\u2019t hurt COMP\u2019s public persona well into the future,\u201d Williams added. \u201cTo avoid issues like this, operations teams should threat model any operational bugs that threaten the viability of the platform itself and review each of these situations before any deployment.\u201dPerhaps this is a huge warning sign that decentralized finance isn\u2019t secure enough to be trusted, another researcher added.\u201cThe complete lack of central authority in cryptocurrency has been used as an excuse by companies to sit on their hands while their users\u2019 get their life savings plundered,\u201d John Bambenek from Netenrich explained to Threatpost. \u201cNow that Compound discovered that the same sword cuts the other way, they are shocked, shocked I tell you, that there is nothing they can do about it. If Compound can\u2019t implement basic financial controls to detect and prevent this, I have very little confidence that other forms of fraud are not far behind on targeting their platform.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Cloud SecurityCryptographyPrivacy",

        "raw text": "Cream Finance is the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) platform for cryptocurrency trading to take a major financial hit at the hands of hackers, losing nearly $19 million in an attack this week on its \u201cflash loan\u201d feature.The attacker was able to steal nearly $29 million before being discovered, 418,311,571 in Amp Coin and 1,308.09 in Ethereum cryptocurrency, Cream Finance confirmed.\u201cWe have stopped the exploit by pausing supply and borrow on AMP,\u201d the company statement said. \u201cNo other markets were affected.\u201dhttps://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance/status/1432249771750686721DeFi platforms connect various cryptocurrency blockchains to create a decentralized infrastructure for borrowing, trading and other transactions.Cream Finance Hit With Reentry Attack According to researchers at PeckShield, a bug in the feature allowed the threat actors to pull off a \u201creentry attack,\u201d which allows funds to be borrowed on a loop, repeatedly, while the previous transaction is being processed.\u201cThe hack is made possible due to a reentrancy bug introduced by $AMP, which is an ERC777-like token and exploited to re-borrow assets during its transfer, before updating its first borrow,\u201d PeckShield explained.2/4 The hack is made possible due to a reentrancy bug introduced by $AMP, which is an ERC777-like token and exploited to re-borrow assets during its transfer before updating the first borrow. pic.twitter.com/oVg0w1FWFt\u2014 PeckShield Inc. (@peckshield) August 30, 2021The attack on Cream Finance comes just days after Poly Networks suffered a $610 million theft, the largest DeFi breach in history, before the money was returned by the attacker in a weird twist, likely after the criminal figured out that stealing the crypto is easier than making a withdrawal.Solidity Leaves Plenty of Room for Error The complexity of implementing Solidity coding language used to create DeFi \u201csmart contracts\u201d on a variety of blockchain platforms leaves plenty of room of coding errors, and opportunity for attackers, Joe Stewart with PhishLabs told Threatpost. An error in smart-contract coding is what enabled the Cream Finance reentry attack, Stewart said.\u201cThe recent security breach of the Cream Finance platform was facilitated by the latest in a long chain of smart contract vulnerabilities introduced by human error (or possibly insider attacks),\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBecause Solidity is an evolving language, it is very easy to shoot yourself in the foot by something as simple as failing to include the correct function modifier in your code \u2013 exactly what happened to the author of the Cream Finance smart contract.\u201dThe layers of complexity are made even more tricky once those DeFi smart contracts start interacting with others,\u201d Stewart added.\u201cThe increasing complexity of DeFi contracts that interact with one another (possibly even across different blockchains) make it difficult to predict all possible code paths that could lead to privilege escalation and loss of funds locked in the contract,\u201d Stewart added. \u201cThis is what happened in the recent PolyNetwork hack resulting in $610M being stolen (although subsequently returned by the hacker).\u201dTal Be\u2019ery, co-founder of ZenGo, pointed out via tweet that in both the attacks on both Cream and Poly Networks, the threat actors wouldn\u2019t have been able to test their various exploits in a lab environment, they were likely poking around for some time in the systems looking for a hole.Attackers Sharpening Tools, Attacks \u201cThe attackers had to develop and test their exploits against a real chain, because it\u2019s too complex to set up in a lab,\u201d Be\u2019ery explained. \u201cA good monitoring (and) alert solution might have given enough time to fix.\u201dA very important corollary from #polynetworkhack .The attackers had to develop and test their exploits against the real chain, because it's too complex to set it up in the lab.A good monitoring + alert solution might have given enough time to fix. https://t.co/IdJsunuVLv\u2014 Tal Be'ery (@TalBeerySec) August 15, 2021As DeFi platforms figure out how to shore up security, Karl Steinkamp with Coalfire warned that threat actors, motivated by volatile crypto-bubbles, are working overtime to refine attacks.\u201cGiven the generally appreciating value of crypto-assets, bad actors will likely continue to use them for many more years into the future,\u201d Steinkamp told Threatpost. \u201cWhile it has been seen currently to a limited extent over the last 10 years, bad cybercriminals will need to get smarter in using blockchains and crypto if they are going to be successful, which will likely include mixing tools and more off-chain and/or hardware addressed wallets.\u201dAnd the most recent data shows DeFi platforms were on the receiving end of 76 percent of all major hacks in 2021 and even before the Poly Networks hack, losses for 2021 had already exploded by 180 percent over last year, according to Atlas VPN.With rising risk of theft, its going to be up to the DeFi platforms themselves and larger cryptocurrency community to offer some reassurance it\u2019s safe.\u201cThe crypto-industry has generated a lot of excitement; however, many newcomers are unaware of the risks,\u201d Atlas VPN\u2019s researchers said. \u201cLack of regulation in the crypto-industry allows cybercriminals to thrive either by hacking less secured DeFi projects or by carrying out rug pull scams. For DeFi to become more legitimate, it is essential to establish security and business regulations.\u201dIn the meantime, KnowBe4\u2019s James McQuiggan suggested that users concerned about security should keep their cryptocurrency stored offline.\u201cWhether reverse-engineering the cryptography or attacking the source, cybercriminals continue to find ways to circumvent controls to steal money for their financial gain and ruin the customers\u2019 portfolios,\u201d McQuiggan said. \u201cIt demonstrates that users should maintain offline wallets to protect a large portion of their investments versus having them all in one location and risk losing their entire investment through a data breach or attack.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Cloud SecurityCryptographyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is warning a vulnerability in Sudo, an open-source program used within its Aruba AirWave management platform, could allow any unprivileged and unauthenticated local user to gain root privileges on a vulnerable host.Rated high in severity, HPE warns the Sudo flaw could be part of a \u201cchained attack\u201d where an \u201cattacker has achieved a foothold with lower privileges via another vulnerability and then uses this to escalate privileges,\u201d according to a recent HPE security bulletin.The Aruba AirWave management platform is HPE\u2019s real-time monitoring and security alert system for wired and wireless infrastructures. The Sudo bug (CVE-2021-3156) was reported in January by Qualys\u00a0researchers and is believed to impact millions of endpoint devices and systems.Sudo is a program used by other platforms that \u201callows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user,\u201d according to the Sudo license.Sudo ReturnsAt the time the Sudo bug was found, Mehul Revankar, Qualys\u2019 VP of Product Management and Engineering, described the Sudo flaw in a research note as, \u201cperhaps the most significant Sudo vulnerability in recent memory (both in terms of scope and impact) and has been hiding in plain sight for nearly 10 years.\u201dFor HPE\u2019s part, the company publicly disclosed the flaw last week and said it affected the AirWave management platform prior to version 8.2.13.0 \u2013 release on June 18, 2021.\u201cA vulnerability in the command line parameter parsing code of Sudo could allow an attacker with access to Sudo to execute commands or binaries with root privileges,\u201d according to the security bulletin.Qualys researchers named the Sudo vulnerability \u201cBaron Samedit\u201d and said the bug was introduced into the Sudo code in July 2011. The bug was first only believed to impact Linux and BSD operating systems, including versions of Linux ranging from Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10 (Sudo 1.8.27) and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Since then, additional vendors have come forward with security warnings.HPE may be the latest to report a Sudo dependency in its code, but it likely won\u2019t be the last.But in February, an Apple security bulletin warned that macOS (macOS Big Sur 11.2, macOS Catalina 10.15.7, macOS Mojave 10.14.6) contained the Sudo flaw inside an unspecified app. The news was followed by Apple\u2019s release of a Sudo patch (Sudo version 1.9.5p2) to mitigate the issue.HPE Offers Mitigation Against SudoIn the context of Aruba AirWave management platform, according to researchers, the bug could be used to carry out privilege escalation attacks. \u201cBy triggering a \u2018heap overflow\u2019 in the app, it becomes possible to change a user\u2019s low-privilege access to that of a root-level user. This is possible either by planting malware on a device or carrying out a brute force attack on a low-privilege Sudo account,\u201d researchers wrote.The Sudo bug is a heap-based buffer overflow, which lets any local user trick Sudo into running in \u201cshell\u201d mode. When\u00a0Sudo is running in shell mode, researchers explain, \u201cit escapes special characters in the command\u2019s arguments with a backslash.\u201d Then, a policy plug-in removes any escape characters before deciding on the Sudo user\u2019s permissions.\u201dHPE says to mitigate the issue users should upgrade to AirWave management platform to 8.2.13.0 and above. Sudo also released a patch earlier this year. A technical workaround also is available for HPE AirWave customers:\u201cTo minimize the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities, Aruba recommends that the CLI and web-based \u00a0management interfaces for AirWave be restricted to a dedicated \u00a0layer 2 segment/VLAN and/or controlled by firewall policies at \u00a0layer 3 and above,\u201d wrote HPE.Vulnerabilities",

The breached company did everything from threaten to sic law enforcement on the attacker on up to its ultimate offer: the position of chief security officer in exchange for getting its money back.Instead of falling victim to the largest DeFi heist in history, all it wound up costing Poly Networks was a bit of embarrassment.Mr. White Hat, as Poly Network dubbed him, said the plan was never to keep the money, just to prove there are security weaknesses associated with DeFi platforms.Mission accomplished.The money was returned in different phases, with the remainder released when the attacker shared the key to a multi-signature wallet on Monday, Coin Rivet added.\u201cPoly Network has successfully retrieved the remaining 28,953 ETH and 1,032 WBTC (about $141 million),\u201d the company said in a statement, according to the cryptocurrency-focused publication Coin Rivet.\u201cAt this point, all the user assets that were transferred out during the incident have been fully recovered,\u201d Poly Network said. \u201cThanks to Mr. White Hat\u2019s cooperation, Poly Network has officially entered the fourth phase of our roadmap \u2018Asset Recovery\u2019.

There was $264.8 million in Ethereum, $250.8 million in Binance Smart Chain and $85 million in Polygon, according to Coin Rivet.On the same day, with few alternatives available to recover the stolen assets, the company decided to try to engage the attacker with an open letter urging Mr. White Hat to return the money.\u201cThe amount of money you hacked is the biggest one in the defi history,\u201d the Poly Network open letter said. \u201cLaw enforcement in any country will regard this as a major economic crime and you will be pursued. \u2026 You should talk to us to work out a solution.\u201dThen, the mood seemed to shift inside Poly Network. Hours later, the company changed tactics and started recruiting the attacker to its team.\u201cTo extend our thanks and encourage Mr. White Hat to continue contributing to security advancement in the blockchain world together with Poly Network, we cordially invite Mr. White Hat to be the Chief Security Advisor of Poly Network,\u201d the company said on a Bloomberg broadcast, according to Coin Rivet. \u201cAgain, it is important to reiterate that Poly Network has no intention of holding Mr. White Hat legally responsible, as we are confident that Mr. White Hat will promptly return full control of the assets to Poly Network and its users.\u201dpic.twitter.com/Yzw4oDenjC\u2014 Poly Network (@PolyNetwork2) August 10, 2021By the next day, Aug. 11, the attacker published what they called a Q&A explaining that they broke into the Poly Network \u201cfor fun\u201d and always planned to return the money.

Comments under the platform\u2019s welcome message included pornographic images and GIFs, while users also spammed the platform\u2019s first post with graphic hentai videos and images of Hillary Clinton\u2019s face photoshopped onto a woman\u2019s naked body, according to the outlet.Next, on the day of Gettr\u2019s birth, on Sunday, July 4, came the first hack, when the profiles of many prominent members were defaced.The second cyber-assault came early today, (Tuesday), when hackers posted a database containing what they claimed were 90,000 users\u2019 email addresses, usernames, status, location and more.Gettr \u2013 a Twitter-esque platform with posts and trending topics \u2013 was quietly launched on Thursday by Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump who\u2019s been teasing it for months. First spotted by Politico, Gettr advertises itself on the Google Play and Apple app stores as a platform \u201cfounded on the principles of free speech, independent thought and rejecting political censorship and \u2018cancel culture'\u201d and as \u201ca non-bias social network for people all over the world.\u201dMiller confirmed to Reuters that the platform was briefly hacked on Sunday, as more than half a million people registered. \u201cThe problem was detected and sealed in a matter of minutes, and all the intruder was able to accomplish was to change a few user names,\u201d Miller said in an email to Reuters.According to Insider, the accounts were first hacked around 8:30 a.m. EST on Sunday, with most profiles restored by 10 a.m. EST.\u2018JubaBaghdad\u2019 Was ThereMultiple Twitter users shared screenshots of the defaced profiles for some of the site\u2019s most prominent users, including that of Miller, former CIA director Mike Pompeo, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, and pro-Trump congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene.Jason Miller's new right-wing social media site \"Gettr\" was hacked this morning. pic.twitter.com/cncddw9RZ9\u2014 Zachary Petrizzo (@ZTPetrizzo) July 4, 2021The profiles for Harlan Hill, Sean Parnell, the pro-Trump broadcaster Newsmax, and Gettr\u2019s official support page were also defaced, as was first reported by Insider.The profiles were changed to show the same message, which started out as \u201c@JubaBaghdad was here \ud83d\ude42 ^^ free palestine ^^\u201d and then apparently switched to the message \u201cJubaBaghdad was here, follow me in twitter :)\u201d.JubaBaghdad, who describes himself as a white-hat hacker, told Insider on Monday that Gettr managed to fix the poorly implemented API that he had pried open for the attack, but that the fix didn\u2019t keep him from scraping user data from individuals\u2019 accounts. He confirmed it by sharing details of a test account that was set up by Insider. JubaBaghdad said that the hack was technically \u201ceasy\u201d to do \u2013 it only took about 20 minutes \u2013 and that his motivation was \u201cjust for fun.\u201dNext: The Stolen User DatabaseThen, in the wee hours of Tuesday morning, Alon Gal, co-founder and chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock, flagged the ripped-off database.\u201cThreat actors were able to take advantage of bad API implemented on Trump\u2019s recent social media platform, Gettr (@GettrOfficial). This allowed them to extract usernames, names, bios, bdays, but most importantly, the emails which were supposed to be private, of over 85,000 users,\u201d Gal tweeted, including images of the hacked data.Threat actors were able to take advantage of bad API implemented on Trump's recent social media platform, Gettr (@GettrOfficial).This allowed them to extract usernames, names, bios, bdays, but most importantly, the emails which were supposed to be private, of over 85,000 users. pic.twitter.com/NsKyz9zHmQ\u2014 Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) July 6, 2021One of the people whose email is in the database confirmed to Motherboard that they are indeed a registered Gettr user. The outlet further verified the database by trying to create accounts with other email addresses from the database. Its attempts were blocked by the site, which told Motherboard that \u201cThe email is taken,\u201d suggesting that those email addresses do in fact belong to previously registered Gettr users.Threatpost has reached out to Gettr support to verify that the platform\u2019s user database was exposed, that a poorly configured API was the cause, and to find out if it has or plans to inform affected users.A Predictable PratfallData scraping can lead to targeting by cyberattackers. It happened last week, when the 1.2 billion victims of LinkedIn\u2019s data scraping attack \u2013 a refined database of 88,000 U.S. business owners \u2013 was posted in a hacker forum.Gettr may have been caught off-guard by the hacks, but plenty of people saw it coming. On the day Gettr launched, security and privacy researchers flagged Gettr\u2019s poorly programmed, bug-ridden API. One of them as Ashkan Soltani, a security and privacy researcher and former FTC chief technologist who found one bug that would allow anyone to brute-force the app\u2019s API by feeding it a list of email addresses and getting a response that shows which ones have successfully registered with Gettr, the other which allowed for the viewing of a list of users that any given user has muted or blocked.Even with such basic functionality, GETTR already has a small privacy issue whereby you can indiscriminately query whether an email address has been used to register (with no rate limiting or token required)https://t.co/9izcGWT5TI pic.twitter.com/2hyiAIFHMa\u2014 ashkan soltani (@ashk4n) July 1, 2021Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.HacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The Akkadian Provisioning Manager, which is used as a third-party provisioning tool within Cisco Unified Communications environments, has three high-severity security vulnerabilities that can be chained together to enable remote code execution (RCE) with elevated privileges, researchers said.They remain unpatched, according to the researchers at Rapid7 who discovered them.Cisco\u2019s UC suite enables VoIP and video communications across business footprints. The Akkadian product is an appliance that\u2019s typically used in large enterprises to help manage the process of provisioning and configuring all of the UC clients and instances, via automation.The issues, all present in version 4.50.18 of the Akkadian platform, are as follows:CVE-2021-31579: Use of hard-coded credentials (ranking 8.2 out of 10 on the CVSS vulnerability-severity scale)CVE-2021-31580 and CVE-2021-31581: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (using exec and vi commands, respectively; ranking 7.9)CVE-2021-31582: Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (ranking 7.9)Combining CVE-2021-31579 with either CVE-2021-31580 or CVE-2021-31581 will allow an unauthorized adversary to gain root-level shell access to affected devices, according to Rapid7. That makes it easy to install cryptominers, keystroke loggers, persistent shells and any other type of Linux-based malware.Meanwhile, researchers said that CVE-2021-31582 can allow an attacker who is already authenticated to the device to alter or delete the contents of the local MariaDB database, which is a free and open-source fork of the MySQL relational database management system. In some cases, attackers could recover LDAP BIND credentials in use in the host organization, which are used to authenticate clients (and the users or applications behind them) to a directory server.\u201cIn addition to these issues, two other questionable findings were discovered: The ability to read the cleartext local MariaDB credentials, and the inadvertent shipping of an entire GitHub repo with commit history,\u201d the firm explained, in a blog post this week. \u201cAt the time of this writing, it\u2019s unclear if these findings present unique security issues, but nonetheless, should be reviewed by the vendor.\u201dCVE-2021-31579: Use of Hard-Coded CredentialsDuring a penetration test on a client site, Rapid7 researchers were able to create a root-shell environment by interrupting the boot process of the appliance, according to the analysis. After that, they were able to peruse the user /etc/passwd database, where the \u2018akkadianuser` was given as the user name.Meanwhile, \u201cinvestigating the user home directory revealed a set of developer files on the production server\u2026[including] developer configuration scripts for configuring a high availability user, which revealed that the high availability user was created with the default password `haakkadianpassword.'\u201dArmed with these credentials, Rapid7 was then able to successfully bypass the restricted shell menu environment using CVE-2021-31580/81.CVE-2021-31580/81: Shell Escape via \u2018exec\u2019 and \u2018vi\u2019 CommandsRapid7 researchers identified that the restricted shell in use by the Akkadian Appliance Manager component was set to a default bash shell.\u201cRapid7 researchers switched the OpenSSH channel from `shell` to `exec` by providing the SSH client a single execution parameter,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThis triggered the interactive Python script to unsuccessfully find the `/dev/tty` file and exit, but as the shell is running in the context of a bash shell, the failed exit condition does not fail the parent shell and the command is passed on through to the operating system allowing a bypass.\u201dBy combining this issue with the default credentials, an unauthenticated, network-based attacker will gain unrestricted access to an interactive shell with root privileges, according to researchers.Rapid7 researchers further found that the restricted shell environment of the Akkadian Appliance Manager component could also be bypassed using the shipped version of \u201cvi,\u201d which is a popular terminal-based text editor. That can be done simply by hitting `:!` and then the desired command.CVE-2021-31581: Exposure of Sensitive InformationIn the third vulnerability, Rapid7 researchers saw that the application was serving sensitive data via the exposed web server.\u201cListing the `/var/www/html/pme/` directory Rapid7 identified the ionCube packed PHP files, but an additional set of files that were marked with readable permissions,\u201d according to the writeup. \u201cMany of these files contained sensitive data that was accessible via the web server. Of note, the `/pme/database/pme/phinx.yml` file contained cleartext local MariaDB usernames and passwords.\u201dRapid7 researchers were then able to use local shell access in order to successfully validate the credentials and connect to the underlying MariaDB host listening locally.How to Protect Your Organization from ExploitsRapid7 disclosed the bugs to Akkadian in February, but despite multiple follow-ups, there\u2019s been no response, according to Rapid7.To protect their environments, companies should restrict network access to the SSH port (22/tcp), so that only trusted users are allowed on, and disable any internet-facing connectivity, Rapid7 recommended.\u201cFurthermore, system operators should know that, in the absence of a fix, users who have access to the Akkadian Appliance Manager effectively have root shell access to the device, due to the second and third issues,\u201d according to the analysis.Akkadian did not immediately return a request for comment by Threatpost.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "UPDATELook out for SteamHide, an emerging malware that disguises itself inside profile images on the gaming platform Steam, which researchers think is being developed for a wide-scale campaign.The Steam platform merely serves as a vehicle which hosts the malicious file, according to research from G Data: \u201cThe heavy lifting in the shape of downloading, unpacking and executing a malicious payload fetched by the loader is handled by an external component, which accesses the malicious profile image on one Steam profile. This external payload can be distributed via crafted emails to compromised websites.\u201dThe technique is called steganography and it\u2019s not new \u2014 but Steam profiles being used as attacker-controlled hosting sites, is.\u201cWhile hiding malware in an image file\u2019s metadata is not a new phenomenon, using a gaming platform such as Steam is previously unheard of,\u201d G Data analyst Karsteen Hahn said about SteamHide in a new disclosure report, which builds on the original find by @miltinh0c on Twitter:Just found malware being hosted on a steam profile inside an image! That's the first time I see someting like that @malwrhunterteam pic.twitter.com/HclAQz4nZ9\u2014 miltinhoc (@miltinh0c) May 13, 2021The malware downloader is hiding in the Steam profile image\u2019s metadata, specifically in the International Color Consortium (ICC) profile, a standardized set of data to control color output for printing. Attackers hide their malware in benign images commonly shared online, including memes like \u201cblinking white guy\u201d used in the G Data analysis example.\u201cThe low-quality image shows three frames of the \u2018white guy blinking\u2019 meme alongside the words January, a black screen, and September,\u201d Hahn added.Victims of the malware don\u2019t have to be on Steam or have any gaming platform installed, G Data\u2019s researchers found. The profile image data only hosts the malware \u2014 to make it onto a victim\u2019s machine, it must be fetched by a loader that\u2019s been loaded onto a compromised device, the report explained.Attackers Have Big Plans for SteamHide Once executed on a victim machine, the malware terminates any security protections and checks for administration rights, the researchers found, then copies itself to \u201cLOCALAPPDATA\u201d folder and persists by creating a key in a registry that G Data identified as \u201c\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\BroMal.\u201dFor now, that\u2019s all it does. But\u00a0G Data said the developers of SteamHide have hidden tools inside their malware that aren\u2019t currently being used, but could be dangerous later; including checking if Teams is installed on the infected machine, and a method stub named \u201cChangeHash\u201d that indicates developers are working on increasingly complex iterations of the existing malware. There\u2019s also a tool that enables the malware to send and receive commands over Twitter.There could be new versions soon: Updating the malware only requires uploading a new profile pic.\u201cI am confident that we will see this malware emerge soon in the wild just like it happened with other in-development families that we covered, e.g., StrRAT and SectopRAT,\u201d according to researchers.It\u2019s hard to say how easy the malware and attacker-controlled profiles would be to root out: Steam\u2019s most recent data said the platform has more than 20 million users playing games, including popular titles like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Dota 2 and Apex Legends. Steam\u2019s parent company Valve hasn\u2019t responded to Threatpost\u2019s request for comment on SteamHide.This isn\u2019t the first time Steam has been hit with cybersecurity issues. For instance, last December, Steam had to fix critical bugs that allowed a remote attacker to crash another player\u2019s game, take over the computer and hijack all the computers connected to a third-party server.This article was updated at 9 a.m. on June 11, 2021 to add clarity around how Steam is being used by cybercriminals.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is urging customers to patch one of its premier edge application management tools that could allow an attacker to carry out a remote authentication bypass attack and infiltrate a customer\u2019s cloud infrastructure.Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.Rated critical, with a CVSS score of 9.8, the bug impacts all versions of HPE\u2019s Edgeline Infrastructure Manager (EIM) prior to version 1.21. EIM is the company\u2019s two-year-old edge computing-management suite. Users are urged to update to HPE EIM v1.22 or later to fix the bug.Researchers at Tenable first identified the vulnerability (CVE-2021-29203) in late January, notifying HPE on February 1 of the critical bug. HPE released fixes for bug on Thursday. More than a dozen versions of software are impacted, running on operating systems ranging from CentOS 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE and multiple versions of Windows, according to HPE.\u201cA security vulnerability has been identified in the HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Manager, also known as HPE Edgeline Infrastructure Management Software. The vulnerability could be remotely exploited to bypass remote authentication leading to execution of arbitrary commands, gaining privileged access, causing denial of service, and changing the configuration,\u201d wrote HPE Product Security Response Team in a security bulletin posted Friday.What\u2019s Behind HPE\u2019s Critical Bug?According to Tenable, the remote authentication-bypass vulnerability is tied to an issue related to how HPE handles password resets for administrator accounts.\u201cWhen [a] user logs in to the web application for the first time with the default password for the existing Administrator account, the user is prompted to change the password for the account. The password change is carried out by sending a request to URL /redfish/v1/SessionService/ResetPassword/1. However, after the password change, an unauthenticated remote attacker can use the same URL to reset the password for the Administrator account,\u201d Tenable wrote.All an attacker has to do next is login to the web application with the updated admin password \u201cby sending a request to URL /redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions,\u201d Tenable explained.From there, researchers said the adversary can then change the password of the \u201cOS root account by sending a request to URL /redfish/v1/AccountService/Accounts/1. This allows the attacker to SSH to the EIM host as root.\u201dSSH stands for Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell and is a network protocol that is most often used by system administrators for remote command-line requests, system logins and also for remote command execution.Tenable posted a proof of concept of the attack. From the time Tenable researchers brought the bug to HPE\u2019s attention and the deployed fix 87 days had elapsed, according to the Tenable.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "Hackers are leveraging the popular Telegram messaging app by embedding its code inside a remote access trojan (RAT) dubbed ToxicEye, new research has found. A victim\u2019s computer infected with the ToxicEye malware is controlled via a hacker-operated Telegram messaging account.The ToxicEye malware\u00a0can take over file systems, install ransomware and leak data from victim\u2019s PCs, according to researchers at Check Point Software Technologies.Download \u201cThe Evolution of Ransomware\u201d to gain valuable insights on emerging trends amidst rapidly growing attack volumes. Click above to hone your defense intelligence!Check Point said it tracked more than 130 cyberattacks in the last three months that leveraged ToxicEye, which was being managed by threat actors over Telegram. Attackers use the messaging service to communicate with their own server and exfiltrate data to it, according to a report published online Thursday.Hackers are likely have targeted Telegram, which has more than 500 million active users across the world, as their distribution platform because of its widespread use and popularity, said Idan Sharabi, research and development manager at Check Point.\u201cWe believe attackers are leveraging the fact that Telegram is used and allowed in almost all organizations, utilizing this system to perform cyber attacks, which can bypass security restrictions,\u201d he said in an e-mailed statement.Researcher point out that Telegram\u2014which is known as a secure and private messaging service\u2013has become even more popular during the pandemic and especially in recent months. That\u2019s because of new privacy and data management policies instituted by WhatsApp raising concern among users and pushing them by the millions to alternative messaging platforms like Telegram.This growing Telegram userbase has led to a corresponding surge by attackers pelting the Telegram platform with a slew of common malware, researchers report. According to Check Point, dozens of \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d malware samples have also been spotted targeting Telegram users.Researchers said Telegram is an ideal way to obscure such activity because it isn\u2019t blocked by anti-virus protections and allows attackers to remain anonymous, requiring only a mobile phone number to sign up, researchers noted. The app also allows attackers to easily exfiltrate data from victims\u2019 PCs or transfer new malicious files to infected machines because of its communications infrastructure, and to do so remotely from any location in the world, they said.Infection ChainThe Telegram RAT attacks begin with threat actors creating a Telegram account and a dedicated Telegram bot, or remote account that allows them to interact with other users in various ways\u2013including to chat, add people to groups or send requests directly from the input field by typing the bot\u2019s Telegram username and a query.Attackers then bundle the bot token with the RAT or other chosen malware and spread the malware via email-based spam campaigns as an email attachment. For example, researchers observed attackers spreading malware via a file called \u201cpaypal checker by saint.exe,\u201d they said.Once a victim opens the malicious attachment, it connects to Telegram and leaves the machine vulnerable to a remote attack via the Telegram bot, which uses the messaging service to connect the victim\u2019s device back to that attackers command-and-control server, according to the report. Post-infection attackers gain full control over a victim\u2019s machine and can engage in a range of nefarious activities, researchers said.In attacks that Check Point observed, the ToxicEye RAT was used to locate and steal passwords, computer information, browser history and cookies from people\u2019s devices; delete and transfer files or kill PC processes as well as take over a PC\u2019s task manager; deploy a keylogger or record audio and video of the victim\u2019s surroundings as well as steal clipboard contents; and use ransomware to encrypt and decrypt victims\u2019 files.Identification and MitigationCheck Point said indication of infection on PCs is the presence of a file called \u201crat.exe\u201d located within the directory C:\\Users\\ToxicEye\\rat[.]exe.Organizations also should monitor the traffic generated from PCs to Telegram accounts when the Telegram app is not installed on the systems in question, researchers said.Researchers encourage hyper-vigilance when it comes to scrutinizing emails. Recipients need to always check the recipient line of an email that appears suspicious before engaging with it, Check Point said. If there is no recipient named or the recipient is unlisted or undisclosed, this likely indicates the email is a phishing or malicious message.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "The leak of personal data from more than 533 million Facebook users was scraped from their profiles by malicious actors because of a security flaw in the company\u2019s platform prior to September 2019, the social media giant said Tuesday.Threat actors posted that data to a public hacker forum over the weekend, once again raising privacy concerns and putting Facebook in the middle of controversy over its protection, or lack thereof, of user data. At the time it was suspected the data had been scraped due to a bug in the Add Friend feature that was discovered in 2019.In an attempt to set the record straight, the company confirmed in a blog post Tuesday that the leak indeed was due to a flaw in its \u201ccontact importer\u201d that has been previously reported and already fixed by the company.\u201cWe believe the data in question was scraped from people\u2019s Facebook profiles by malicious actors using our contact importer prior to September 2019,\u201d according to the post by Mike Clark, a Facebook product management director. \u201cThis feature was designed to help people easily find their friends to connect with on our services using their contact lists.\u201dIn his post, Clark called the leak\u00a0 \u201canother example of the ongoing, adversarial relationship technology companies have with fraudsters who intentionally break platform policies to scrape internet services\u201d and said the company is confident that the issue that allowed for the data scraping \u201cno longer exists.\u201dPossible Regulatory ActionNo matter, Facebook still faces an investigation by some regulators in the European Union over the incident and could face fines over the incident. Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission (IDPC) is the first watchdog group to say it\u2019s looking into the matter because of its possible infringement of the General Data Protection Rule (GDPR), which mandates that companies disclose data breaches within a certain period of time or face penalties.\u201cA significant number\u201d of the users affected by the breach were from the EU, according to a post on the DPC website, putting them at risk for phishing, marketing scams and other cybercriminal activity.\u201cPrevious datasets were published in 2019 and 2018 relating to a large-scale scraping of the Facebook website which at the time Facebook advised occurred between June 2017 and April 2018 when Facebook closed off a vulnerability in its phone lookup functionality,\u201d the DPC said in the post. \u201cBecause the scraping took place prior to GDPR, Facebook chose not to notify this as a personal data breach under GDPR.\u201dSome of the data leaked over the weekend data may be from a later period, however, which could mean Facebook is in breach of the GDPR, according to the DPC.\u201cThe DPC attempted over the weekend to establish the full facts and is continuing to do so,\u201d according to the commission, which is working with Facebook to resolve the investigation.Scraping Remains a ThreatThe data leaked is now accessible to anyone for under $3, or essentially free, and includes \u00a0Facebook user mobile phone numbers, their Facebook ID, name and gender information. About 32 million were tied to user accounts based in the United States.The leak not only highlights ongoing privacy concerns with Facebook and other social-media companies, it also puts the common tactic of scraping and its potential dangers back in the spotlight.Scraping is \u201ca common attack pattern\u201d used by threat actors to siphon public information from the internet that can then be sold online for profit and reused for malicious activity, Michael Isbitski, technical evangelist at Salt Security, told Threatpost via email on Monday.For its part, Facebook said it will continue to crack down on the practice of \u201cscraping data using features meant to help people,\u201d which violates the platform\u2019s terms, Clark said in his post. \u201cWe have teams across the company working to detect and stop these behaviors,\u201d he wrote.Facebook also will work toward having the most recent data set taken offline and \u201cwill continue to aggressively go after malicious actors who misuse our tools wherever possible,\u201d Clark said.Alon Gal, CTO at Hudson Rock, is credited for first spotting the 533 million account records. Originally, the dataset was searchable for a price, according to an ad seen on secure messaging app Telegram. Now, that same data is available on public online forums frequented by criminals for anyone to abuse, Rock noted.\u201cBad actors will certainly use the information for social engineering, scamming, hacking and marketing,\u201d he tweeted over the weekend.Ever wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums?

        "raw text": "A U.K. water supplier suffered a disruption in its corporate IT systems Monday as a result of a cyber-attack but claims that its water supply was not affected.Meanwhile, the alleged attack perpetrator\u2014the Clop ransomware group\u2014claimed the attack was on another, larger water utility, which for its part indignantly called the claim a \u201ccyber hoax.\u201dSouth Staffordshire PLC, the parent company of South Staffs Water and Cambridge Water, confirmed on Monday that it was the victim of a cyber-attack that did not affect its \u201cability to supply safe water\u201d to all of its customers, it said in a statement Monday. The company provides water to about 1.6 million consumers daily.The lack of disruption in water supply was \u201cin thanks to the robust systems and controls over water supply and quality we have in place at all times as well as the quick work of our teams to respond to this incident and implement the additional measures we have put in place on a precautionary basis,\u201d the company said in its statement.South Staffordshire\u2019s IT teams were working to resolve the disruption to the corporate network on Monday, while customer service remained unaffected, the company said.Victim MisidentifiedThe Clop ransomware gang took responsibility for an attack on a U.K. water supplier on its dark web site, but said the victim was Thames Water and not South Staffordshire, according to a report posted on Bleepingcomputer. Thames Water is the United Kingdom\u2019s largest water supplier, serving 15 million customers in Greater London and other areas on the river that runs through the city.Thames Water quickly took to its website to let all of its customers know that any media report claiming it suffered a cyber-attack was completely bogus. In its post, the Clop gang claimed it accessed the company\u2019s SCADA systems.\u201cWe are aware of reports in the media that Thames Water is facing a cyber attack,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe want to reassure you that this is not the case and we are sorry if the reports have caused distress.\u201dFurther inspection of stolen data dumped from the attack on the Clop site appears to confirm Thames Water\u2019s assurance, as it includes a spreadsheet of usernames and passwords featuring South Staff Water and South Staffordshire email addresses, according to Bleepingcomputer.The breached data, published online after ransom negotiations between Clop and its victim broke down, also includes passports, screenshots from water-treatment SCADA systems, driver\u2019s licenses and more, the report said.Water Supply Under AttackThe incident is among a series of attacks on critical infrastructure that will likely continue as threat actors increasingly focus their cybercriminal efforts against systems that people depend on, which also boosts their chances of successfully extorting victims, noted one security professional.\u201cIn the case of financially motivated attacks designed to obtain a ransom, wrongdoers have significantly more chances of getting paid by cruelly exploiting people in extreme need,\u201d observed Ilia Kolochenko, founder of ImmuniWeb and a member of the Europol Data Protection Experts Network, in an email to Threatpost.The attack in the United Kingdom comes as Europe and other regions are suffering from unprecedented wildfires and catastrophic drought, which can unwittingly bolster the efforts of attacks on critical infrastructure, he said.\u201cTherefore, [critical infrastructure] operators should prepare for a mounting number of cyber-attacks exacerbated by spiralling natural disasters,\u201d Kolochenko said.The U.K. attack comes auspiciously on the heels of a dire warning issued by the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation (CCTI) in June that was focused on water utilities in the United States but could be said of most facilities providing the critical resource.The center claimed that the inherent lack of cybersecurity preparedness of U.S. water utilities makes them a prime target for attack, with CCTI Chair Samantha Ravich calling water the greatest vulnerability in U.S. national infrastructure.Last year a glimpse of what could be possible in a successful attack on a water supply occurred when an attacker hacked a water treatment facility in Oldsmar, Fla., and raised the levels of sodium hydroxide, or lye, in the water. An operator quickly noticed the attack and corrected the lye levels in the water before any significant damage was done, but the attack could have been extremely dangerous had it not been thwarted quickly, officials said at the time.\u00a0Critical InfrastructureMalware",

        "raw text": "Targeted phishing attacks are traced to multiple threat actors who have each independently focused on stealing credentials and sensitive data and tracking the geolocation of journalists.In a Thursday report by Proofpoint, researchers outline individual efforts by advance persistent threat (APT) groups who they say are aligned with China, North Korea, Iran and Turkey. Attacks began in early 2021 and are ongoing, researchers said.According to the report, the APTs are acting independently of each other but share the same overall goal of targeting journalists. Tactics are also similar, with threat actors targeting email and social-media accounts as phishing inroads in cyberespionage campaigns.Often posing as journalists themselves, the threat actors have focused on phishing campaigns with the goal of credential harvesting, theft of data helpful to specific regimes and digital surveillance of political journalists.APT Tradecraft: The Phish \u00a0The attacks typically involved some type of social engineering to lower the guard of targets in order to coax them to download and execute various malicious payloads onto their personal digital devices, researchers said. Lures included emails and messages sent via various social media platforms on topics related to their area of political focus, researchers said.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office. WATCH HERE.]In various instances the attackers would lie low, post malware infection, in order to gain persistence on a recipient\u2019s network and conduct lateral network reconnaissance and propagate additional malware infections within the target\u2019s network.Secondary tactics included tracking or surveilling journalists. Proofpoint said adversaries used web beacons planted on journalists\u2019 devices to carry out the surveillance.Journalist Have Been Targeted Before, But Not Like ThisWhile the latest report tracks some of the most recent activity against journalists, targeting this group of individuals certainly isn\u2019t novel, given the type of information to which journalists have access to when it comes to political and socio-economic issues, they noted.\u201cAPT actors, regardless of their state affiliation, have and will likely always have a mandate to target journalists and media organizations and will use associated personas to further their objectives and collection priorities,\u201d researchers wrote.Moreover, this focus on media by APTs is unlikely to ever wane, which should inspire journalists to do everything they can to secure their communications and sensitive data, they said.China-backed APTs Strike in U.S.Between January and February 2021, Proofpoint researchers identified five campaigns byChinese APT TA412, also known also as Zirconium, targeting US-based journalists, most notably those covering U.S. politics and national security during events that gained international attention, researchers said.The way the campaigns were crafted depended upon the current U.S. political climate, and attackers switched targets depending on which journalists were covering topics in which the Chinese government has interest, they said.One reconnaissance phishing campaign occurred in the days immediately preceding the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building, with attackers focusing specifically on White House and Washington-based correspondents during this time, they said.Attacker used subject lines pulled from recent U.S. news articles related to pertinent political topics at the time, including actions of former President Donald Trump, U.S. political movements related to China and, more recently, the U.S. stance and involvement in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, researchers said.Varying PayloadsIn the observed campaigns, Zirconium used as its payload web beacons, a tactic consistent with malicious cyberespionage campaigns against journalists that the APT has conducted since 2016, researchers said.Web beacons, commonly referred to as tracking pixels, tracking beacons, or web bugs, embed a hyperlinked non-visible object within the body of an email that, when enabled, attempts to retrieve a benign image file from an actor-controlled server.\u201cProofpoint researchers assess these campaigns have been intended to validate targeted emails are active and to gain fundamental information about the recipients\u2019 network environments,\u201d they wrote.Researchers observed another Chinese-backed APT, TA459, in late April 2022 targeting media personnel in Southeast Asia with emails containing a malicious Royal Road RTF attachment, if opened, would install and execute Chinoxy malware\u2013a backdoor that is used to gain persistence on a victim\u2019s machine.The targeted entity was responsible for reporting on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which aligns with TA459\u2019s historic mandate of collecting on intelligence matters related to Russia and Belarus, researchers noted.Fake Job Opportunities from North KoreaResearchers also observed North Korea-aligned TA404\u2014better known as Lazarus\u2013in early 2022 targeting a U.S.-based media organization with phishing attacks that appeared to offer job opportunities from reputable companies to journalists, they reported. The attack is reminiscent of a similar one against engineers that the group mounted in 2021.\u201cIt started with reconnaissance phishing that used URLs customized to each recipient,\u201d researchers wrote of the recent phishing campaign. \u201cThe URLs impersonated a job posting with landing pages designed to look like a branded job posting site.\u201dThe sites were fraudulent, however, and the URLs were armed to relay identifying information about the computer, or device someone was working from to allow the host to keep track of the intended target, researchers said.Turkey-backed APT Targets Twitter CredentialsAPTs with alleged ties to Turkey\u2019s government have also targeted journalists, with one campaign including one \u201cprolific threat actor\u201d TA482 observed by Proofpoint. According to researchers, the APT has been actively targeting journalists since early 2022, via Twitter accounts in efforts to steal credentials from mainly U.S.-based journalists and media organizations.The motive behind the group appears to be to spread propaganda in support of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan the Turkish ruling political party, Justice and Development Party, though this cannot be confirmed with certainty, researchers noted.The campaigns use phishing emails typically related to Twitter security\u2014alerting a user to a suspicious log-in\u2013to gain the recipient\u2019s attention, taking them to a credential harvesting page that impersonates Twitter if they click on a link.Iranian APTs Harvest CredentialsIran-linked APTs have been particularly active on their assault against journalists and newspapers, typically posing as journalists themselves in attacks to engage in surveillance against targets and harvest their credentials, Proofpoint has found.One of the most active perpetrators of these attacks is TA453, known as Charming Kitten, a notorious group aligned with intelligence collection efforts of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp, Proofpoint said.This group is notorious for masquerading as journalists from around the world to target journalists, academics and researchers alike by engaging in discussion aboutforeign policy or other topics related to the Middle East, after which they will be invited to a virtual meetings via a customized, but benign PDF.However, the PDF\u2014typically delivered from file hosting services\u2014almost always contains a link to a URL shortener and IP tracker that redirects targets to actor-controlled credential-harvesting domains, researchers said.TA456, also known as Tortoiseshell, is another Iran-aligned threat actor that routinely poses as media organizations to target journalists with newsletter-themed emails containing web beacons that can track targets.Another Iranian state-sponsored actor, TA457, hides behind the persona of a fake media organization called \u201ciNews Reporter\u201d to deliver malware to public relations personnelfor companies located in the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia, researchers said. Between September 2021 and March 2022, Proofpoint observed campaigns by the prolific threat actor that occurred approximately every two to three weeks, they said.In one campaign that occurred in March 2022, TA457 sent an email with the ironic subject line \u201cIran Cyber War\u201d that ultimately dropped a remote access trojan on victims\u2019 machines. The campaign was seen targeting both individual and group email addresses at a handful of Proofpoint customers involved in energy, media, government and manufacturing, researchers reported.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office.

        "raw text": "Surviving ransomware is possible with a combination of preparation and intentionality. Often, there is a misguided characterization of ransomware attacks that implies defenders either completely thwart an attack or that attackers establish complete control of their targets\u2019 IT infrastructure. But the past couple of years have illustrated that defenders\u2019 success in dealing with ransomware attacks fall along a broad spectrum of potential outcomes, some obviously better than others.It\u2019s also easy to imagine that all groups who are in the ransomware business have the same skills, aim for the same goals, and operate under the same business models. But as is the case in any industry vertical, ransomware groups come with a wide range of skills and a variety of goals and business models.And while it\u2019s in vogue to refer to REvil and DarkSide as \u201cfranchise models\u201d which supply Ransomware-as-a-Service, it is important to remember that the franchisees are effectively freelance cybercriminals. The franchiser provides back-office operations for these freelancers while exerting little influence on how they otherwise operate.Given the above, let\u2019s consider each of the factors that may affect an attack\u2019s outcome.Attacker Skill and Persistence The skills of the attackers and the skills of the defenders \u2013 plus some elements of luck \u2013 generally determine the possible extent to which an attack could progress:Low skills: Some attackers may be skilled at attacking organizations with lagging security practices but will often meet their match in organizations that have robust defensesWrong skills: Attackers with skills and tooling useful in attacking traditional data centers will have trouble breaking into targets who have moved everything to the cloudBad luck: Organizations who are generally locked down but may have a temporary exposure which an attacker happens to stumble acrossGood luck: Organizations who have left a persistent opening (e.g., open RDP access to the outside in an AWS enclave) may have a run of good luck as no attacker encounters itAttacker GoalAttack groups may also specialize in leak-centered vs. operation-centered goals.Leak-centered goals involve exfiltrating and threatening to leak confidential data belonging to the targeted organization. The most valuable data in this regard is often data related to the target\u2019s customers and employees as the potential for reputational and legal liability acts as a strong incentive for ransom payment.Alternately, public disclosure or sale of intellectual property or trade secrets can also warrant the payment of ransom. The playbook for such attacks generally involves sending the victim a sample of the data to show what the attacker has. From there, it can escalate to publicizing a data sample and contacting the victim\u2019s customers to apply pressure to the victim to pay the ransom.An example of an attack with a leak-centered goal was the REvil-associated attack on Quanta, which exfiltrated specs of future Apple product designs. The attackers first demanded a $50m ransom from Quanta but soon decided that Apple had deeper pockets and tried to extort $50m in return for not publicly leaking the data or selling it to an Apple competitor.Operation-centered goals involve attempts to cripple the ability of the victim organization to continue to operate. These attacks sometimes focus on traditional IT systems and at other times target systems which act as OT (Operational Technology), but which are often assembled from legacy IT (e.g. Windows NT) technology.The exfiltration of confidential data and public leak or sale of the data is usually not present in this scheme. The DarkSide-associated attack on Colonial Pipeline (who paid $4.5m in ransom) and the REvil-associated attack on JBS Foods (who paid $11m in ransom) squarely targeted this goal: the ransoms were paid to try to ensure quick recovery in the ability of the companies to resume normal operations.Degrees of Success Several factors (including luck) constrain the possible outcomes of a ransomware attack. Possible outcomes include:The attackers make insufficient progress on a targeted organization and give up. This may be due to the perceived degree of difficulty in successfully carrying out the attack or because some other targets that the attackers are simultaneously pursuing look more promising. Think of this as opportunity cost. Either way, no ransom is demanded.The attackers succeed to a point and believe themselves to have some leverage in demanding a ransom, but the ransom is ultimately not paid. The outcome in these cases is often some operational impact or reputational harm, but ultimately survival and (hopefully) a sense of renewed commitment to cyber security.The attackers succeed to a point and the ransom request is modest enough that the victim may choose to pay the ransom as it is less costly than the recovery effort would be. This may also be influenced by the victim having a cyber insurance policy which provides ransomware coverage.The attackers get access to the crown jewels and effectively can prevent the victim organization from operating their business. In this case, the victim organization may pay the ransom (Colonial Pipeline, JBS Foods) and restore services relatively quickly. Or they refuse to pay it (see the RobbinHood attack of the city of Baltimore or the Samsam attack on the city of Atlanta) and basically end up rebuilding their IT infrastructure from the ground up.TakeawaysYou should tabletop various scenarios covering attackers pursuing both leak-centered and operations-centered goals and consider your reactions to partial and complete success by the attackers:Know the extent of your cyber insurance policy and what limitations it has.If it comes to a ransom request, will your cyber insurance provider provide someone to handle ransom negotiations?Do you have an incident response firm on retainer?How robust is your disaster recovery plan?Many of these types of questions will surface from tabletop exercises which will help you be more prepared should the fateful day arrive.Oliver Tavakoli is CTO at\u00a0Vectra AI.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.\u00a0InfoSec InsiderMalware",

        "raw text": "An advanced persistent threat group, with ties to Iran, is believed behind a phishing campaign targeting high-profile government and military Israeli personnel, according to a report by Check Point Software.Targets of the campaign included a senior leadership in the Israeli defense industry, the former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and the former Deputy Prime Minister of Israel.The goal of the campaign, the researchers said, was to obtain personal information from targets.Fake Emails from Legit AddressesOne of the targets, according to Check Point, is Tzipi Livni, Israel\u2019s former foreign minister, minister of justice and vice prime minister. Researchers believe that the target was selected because of the high-caliber list of contacts in her address book.Not long ago she received an email from, according to the researchers, \u201ca well-known former Major General in the IDF who served in a highly sensitive position.\u201d The sender address was not spoofed \u2013 it was the same domain she\u2019d corresponded with before. Translated from Hebrew, the message read:Hello my dear friends, Please see attached article to summarize the year. ((*eyes only*)) Of course I don\u2019t want it to be distributed, because it is not the final version. I would be happy to receive remarks of any kind. Have a great rest of the day.The message contained a link. Livni delayed in clicking the link, prompting several follow-up emails.Good morning, I haven\u2019t heard from you. Some friends sent me remarks. Your remarks are also very important to me. I know you are very busy. But I wanted to ask you to take your time and read the article. Good weekThe persistence of the sender and flurry of messages raised her suspicions, according to Check Point. After Livni met with the former Major General, it became clear that the emails were sent from a compromised account and the contents of the messages were part of a phishing attack.It was a similar story for the other targets in this campaign \u2013 suspect emails were being sent from legitimate contacts.What Really HappenedThe method of attack wasn\u2019t particularly technical. \u201cThe most sophisticated part of the operation is the social engineering,\u201d Sergey Shykevich, threat intelligence group manager at Check Point Research, noted. He said, the campaign was \u201ca very targeted phishing chain that is specifically crafted for each target.\u201d Personally crafted phishing emails is a technique called spear phishing.The attackers initiated their spear phishing attacks, first by compromising an email address book belonging to a contact of their target. Then, using the hijacked account, they\u2019d continue an already existing email chain between the contact and the target. In time, they\u2019d steer the conversation towards conning the target to clicking on or opening a malicious link or document.\u201cSome of the emails include a link to a real document that is relevant to the target,\u201d Check Point\u2019s analysts noted. For example, an \u201cinvitation to a conference or research, phishing page of Yahoo, link to upload document scans.\u201d\u201cThe goal,\u201d in the end, was \u201cto steal their personal information, passport scans, and steal access to their mail accounts.\u201dWho and Why\u201cWe have solid evidence that it started at least from December 2021,\u201d Shykevich wrote, \u201cbut we assume that it started earlier.\u201dIn their analysis, the researchers found evidence they believe points to the Iran-linked Phosphorus APT group (a.k.a. Charming Kitten, Ajax Security, NewsBeef, APT35). Phosphorus is one of Iran\u2019s most active APTs, with \u201ca long history of conducting high-profile cyber operations, aligned with the interest of the Iranian regime, as well as targeting Israeli officials.\u201dIran and Israel are usually at odds, and these attacks came \u201cin the midst of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. With recent assassinations of Iranian officials (some affiliated with the Israeli\u2019s Mossad), and the thwarted attempts to kidnap Israeli citizens worldwide, we suspect that Phosphorous will continue with its ongoing efforts in the future.\u201dGovernment",

The malicious Mac executable used in the campaign targets both Apple and Intel chip-based systems.The campaign, identified by researchers from ESET Research Labs and revealed in a series of tweets posted Tuesday, impersonates cryptocurrency trader Coinbase in a job description claiming to seek an engineering manager for product security, researchers divulged.Dubbed Operation In(ter)ception, the recent campaign drops a signed Mac executable disguised as a job description for Coinbase, which researchers discovered uploaded to VirusTotal from Brazil, they wrote.\u201cMalware is compiled for both Intel and Apple Silicon,\u201d according to one of the tweets. \u201cIt drops three files: a decoy PDF document Coinbase_online_careers_2022_07.pdf, a bundle http[://]FinderFontsUpdater[.]app and a downloader safarifontagent.\u201dSimilarities to Previous MalwareThe malware is similar to a sample discovered by ESET in May, which also included a signed executable disguised as a job description, was compiled for both Apple and Intel, and dropped a PDF decoy, researchers said.However, the most recent malware is signed July 21, according to its timestamp, which means it\u2019s either something new or a variant of the previous malware. It uses a certificate issued in February 2022 to a developer named Shankey Nohria and which was revoked by Apple on Aug. 12, researchers said. The app itself was not notarized.Operation In(ter)ception also has a companion Windows version of the malware dropping the same decoy and spotted Aug. 4 by Malwarebytes threat intelligence researcher Jazi, according to ESET.The malware used in the campaign also connects to a different command and control (C2) infrastructure than the malware discovered in May, https:[//]concrecapital[.]com/%user%[.]jpg, which did not respond when researchers tried to connect to it.Lazarus on the LooseNorth Korea\u2019s Lazarus is well known as one of the most prolific APTs and already is in the crosshairs of international authorities, having been sanctioned back in 2019 by the U.S. government.Lazarus is known for targeting academics, journalists and professionals in various industries\u2014particularly the defense industry\u2013to gather intelligence and financial backing for the regime of Kim Jong-un. It has often used impersonation ploys similar to the one observed in Operation In(ter)ception to try to get victims to take the malware bait.A previous campaign identified in January also targeted job-seeking engineers by dangling fake employment opportunities at them in a spear-phishing campaign. The attacks used Windows Update as a living-off-the-land technique and GitHub as a C2 server.Meanwhile, a similar campaign uncovered last year saw Lazarus impersonating defense contractors Boeing and General Motors and claiming to seek job candidates only to spread malicious documents.Changing It Up However, more recently Lazarus has diversified its tactics, with the feds revealing that Lazarus also has been responsible for a number of crypto heists aimed at padding the regime of Jong-un with cash.Related to this activity, the U.S. government levied sanctions against cryptocurrency mixer service Tornado Cash for helping Lazarus launder cash from its cybercriminal activities, which they believe in part are being to fund North Korea\u2019s missile program.Lazarus even has dipped its toe in ransomware amid its frenzy of cyberextortion activity. In May, researchers at cybersecurity firm Trellix tied the recently emerged VHD ransomware to the North Korean APT.GovernmentHacks",

        "raw text": "A new malware is hijacking high-profile Meta Facebook Business and advertising platform accounts through a phishing campaign that targets LinkedIn accounts. The malware, dubbed Ducktail, uses browser cookies from authenticated user sessions to take over accounts and steal data, researchers said.Researchers from WithSecure, formerly F-Secure, discovered the ongoing campaign, which appears to be the work of financially driven Vietnamese threat actors, they wrote in a report published Tuesday. The campaign itself appears to have been active since at least the second half of 2021, while the threat actors behind it may have been on the cybercriminal scene since 2018, researchers said.\u201cThe malware is designed to steal browser cookies and take advantage of authenticated Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim\u2019s Facebook account and ultimately hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has sufficient access to,\u201d researchers wrote in a blog post accompanying the report.Ducktail actors have very specific targets in mind\u2014that is, individuals within companies operating on Facebook\u2019s Business and advertising platform that have high-level access to the account. These include people with managerial, digital marketing, digital media, and human\nresources roles in targeted companies, researchers said.\u201cThese tactics would increase the adversary\u2019s chances of compromising the respective Facebook Business all the while flying under the radar,\u201d researchers wrote.To infiltrate accounts, actors are targeting LinkedIn users with a phishing campaign that lures victims using keywords related to brands, products and project planning into downloading an archive file containing the malware executable alongside related images, documents and video files, researchers reported.Malware ComponentsResearchers took a deep dive into the novel malware, which in its latest samples is written exclusively in .NET Core and compiled via its single-file feature, something \u201cnot commonly seen in malware,\u201d they noted.Ducktail operates using six key components once it infects a system. It first does Mutex creation and check to ensure that only a single instance of the malware is running at any given time, researchers said.A data storage component stores and loads stolen data in a text file in a temporary folder, while a browser-scanning feature scans installed browsers to identify cookie paths for later theft.Ducktail also has two components dedicated to stealing info from victims, one that\u2019s more general, stealing non-Facebook related information, and another that steals info specifically related to Facebook Business and advertising accounts as well as hijacks those accounts, researchers said.The first general information-stealing component scans an infected machine for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave Browser or Firefox and, for each one it finds, extracts all stored cookies, including any Facebook session cookie.The component of Ducktail dedicated to extracting data from Facebook Business/Ads accounts directly interacts with various Facebook endpoints\u2014either direct Facebook pages or API endpoints\u2013from the victim\u2019s machine using a stolen Facebook session cookie, researchers said. It also other security credentials obtained from the cookie to extract information from the victim\u2019s Facebook account, they said.Specific info that the malware steals from Facebook includes: security credentials, personal account identification info, business details and advertising account info.Ducktail also allows threat actors to take full administration control over Facebook Business accounts, which can give them access to a user\u2019s credit card or other transactional data for financial gain, researchers said.Telegram C&C and Other Evasion TricksA final component of Ducktail exfiltrates data to a Telegram channel used as the threat actors\u2019 command and control (C&C), researchers said. This allows the actor to evade detection by limiting the commands it sends from C&C to the victim\u2019s machine, researchers said.Moreover, the malware does not establish persistence on a machine, which also allows means it can get in and do its dirty work without alerting the user or flagging Facebook security, researchers said. However, different versions of Ducktail observed by threat actors performed this lack of persistence in various ways, they said.\u201cOlder versions of the malware simply executed, did what they were designed to do, and then exited,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cNewer versions run an infinite loop in the background that performs exfiltration activities periodically.\u201dDucktail also has inherent features in Facebook data-stealing component that is designed to circumvent Meta security features by making any request for data to Facebook entities appear to be coming from the victim\u2019s primary browser. This would make these actions appear benign to Meta security, researchers said.Attackers also can use information such as stolen session cookies, access tokens, 2FA codes, user agents, IP address and geolocation, as well as general account information, to cloak and impersonate the victim, researchers said.Malware",

This type of malware\u2013in which malicious applications subscribe users to premium services without their knowledge or consent to rack up payment charges\u2013is called toll fraud malware, or more commonly, fleeceware.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office. WATCH HERE.]Ingrao said he discovered eight applications on the site spreading Autolycos since June 2021 that had racked up several million downloads. The cybercriminals behind Autolycos are using Facebook pages and running ads on Facebook and Instagram to promote the malware, he said.\u201cFor example, there were 74 ad campaigns for Razer Keyboard & Theme malware,\u201d Ingrao tweeted in one of a series of follow-up posts describing how the malware works.Joker Rides AgainIngrao compared the malware to Joker, a spyware discovered in 2019 that also secretly subscribed people to premium services and stole SMS messages, among other nefarious activities.Indeed, upon further examination, researchers from Malwarebytes believe the malware is a new variant of Joker\u2013what Malwarebytes refers to as \u201cAndroid/Trojan.Spy.Joker\u2013Malwarebytes intelligence researcher Pieter Artnz said in a post published a day after Ingrao\u2019s revelation.Joker was the first major malware families hat specialized in in fleeceware, according to Malwarebytes. The trojan would hide in the advertisement frameworks utilized by the malicious apps propagating it; these frameworks aggregate and serve in-app ads.After the apps with Joker were installed, they would show a \u201csplash\u201d screen, which would display the app logo, to throw off victims while performing various malicious processes in the background, such as stealing SMSes and contact lists as well as performing ad fraud and signing people up for subscriptions without their knowledge.Difference in ExecutionOne difference between the original Joker and Autolycos, however, was pointed out by Ingrao.\u201dNo webview like #Joker but only http requests,\u201d he tweeted.\u201cIt retrieves a JSON (Java Script Object Notation) on the C2 address: 68.183.219.190/pER/y,\u201d Ingrao said of Autolycos in a tweet. \u201cIt then executes the URLs, for some steps it executes the URLs on a remote browser and returns the result to include it in the requests.\u201dMalwarebytes\u2019 Artnz also explained this difference further in his post. While Joker used webviews\u2014or a piece of Web content, such as \u201ca tiny part of the app screen, a whole page, or anything in between\u201d\u2014to do its dirty week, Autolycos avoids this by executing URLs on a remote browser and then including the result in HTTP requests, he wrote.This helps Autolycos evade detection even more adeptly than the original Joker, according to Malwarebytes\u2019 Artnz said. \u201cNot requiring a WebView greatly reduces the chances that the user of an affected device notices something fishy is going on,\u201d he wrote.Lag Time in Discovery and App RemovalThe eight apps in which Ingrao discovered Autolycos are:Vlog Star Video Editor (com.vlog.star.video.editor) \u2013 1 million downloadsCreative 3D Launcher (app.launcher.creative3d) \u2013 1 million downloadsWow Beauty Camera (com.wowbeauty.camera) \u2013 100,000 downloadsGif Emoji Keyboard (com.gif.emoji.keyboard) \u2013 100,000 downloadsFreeglow Camera 1.0.0 (com.glow.camera.open) \u2013 5,000 downloadsCoco Camera v1.1 (com.toomore.cool.camera) \u2013 \u00a01,000 downloadsFunny Camera by KellyTech \u2013 \u00a0500,000 downloadsRazer Keyboard & Theme by rxcheldiolola \u2013 50,000 downloads.While Ingrao discovered the offending apps in July 2021 and reported them to Google quickly, he told BleepingComputer that the company took six months to remove six of the apps. Moreover, Google only finally removed the last two on July 13, according to Malwarebytes.Artnz was critical of the lag time between discovery and removal, though he did not speculate as to the reason why, noting only that \u201cthe small footprint and masked usage of APIs must make it hard to find malicious apps among the multitude of apps that can be found in the Google Play Store.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible [the malicious apps] would still be available if the researcher hadn\u2019t gone public because he said he got tired of waiting,\u201d Artnz wrote.Google did not immediately respond to request for comment on Monday.

        "raw text": "A sneaky malware for Linux is backdooring devices to steal data and can affect all the processes running on a particular machine, researchers have found.The malware, dubbed Orbit, is unlike other Linux threats in that it steals information from different commands and utilities and then stores them in specific files on the machine, researchers from security automation firm Intezer discovered. In fact, the malware\u2019s name comes from one of the filenames it to temporarily store the output of executed commands, they said.Orbit can either achieve persistence on a machine or be installed as volatile implant, Intezer\u2019s Nicole Fishbein explained in a blog post on Orbit published this week.The malware sets itself apart from similar threats is its \u201calmost hermetic hooking\u201d of libraries on the targeted machines, which allows it to gain persistence and evade detection while stealing information and setting SSH backdoor, she said.\u201cThe malware implements advanced evasion techniques and gains persistence on the machine by hooking key functions, provides the threat actors with remote access capabilities over SSH, harvests credentials, and logs TTY commands,\u201d Fishbein wrote in the post.Moreover, once Orbit is installed, it infects all of the running processes on the machine, including new ones, she said.Setting Itself ApartTypically, existing Linux threats such as Symbiote and HiddenWasp hijack shared Linux libraries by modifying the environment variable LD_PRELOAD. Orbit works differently, however, using two different ways to load the malicious library, Fishbein wrote.\u201cThe first way is by adding the shared object to the configuration file that is used by the loader,\u201d she explained in the post. \u201cThe second way is by patching the binary of the loader itself so it will load the malicious shared object.\u201dSpecifically, Orbit uses XOR encrypted strings and steals passwords, tactics that are similar to other Linux backdoors already reported by researchers at \u00a0ESET, Fishbein wrote.But that\u2019s where the similarity with how those backdoors hijack libraries ends, she said. Orbit goes a step further by not only stealing info from different commands and utilities, but implementing \u201can extensive usage of files\u201d for storing the stolen data, something researchers have not seen before, Fishbein wrote.Installation and ExecutionOrbit loads onto a Linux machine or device via a dropper that not only installs the payload but also prepares the environment for the malware execution.To install the payload and add it to the shared libraries that are being loaded by the dynamic linker, the dropper calls a function called patch_ld and then the symbolic link of the dynamic linker /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2. The latter is done to check if the malicious payload is already loaded by searching for the path used by the malware, researchers said.If the payload is found, the function can swap it with the other location, they noted. Otherwise, the dropper looks for /etc/ld.so.preload and replaces it with a symbolic link to the location of malicious library: /lib/libntpVnQE6mk/.l or /dev/shm/ldx/.l, depending on the argument passed to the dropper.Lastly, the dropper will append /etc/ld.so.preload to the end of the temp file to make sure that the malicious library will be loaded first, researchers said.The payload itself is a shared object (.SO file) that can be placed either in persistent storage or in shim-memory. \u201cIf it\u2019s placed in the first path the malware will be persistent, otherwise it is volatile,\u201d Fishbein wrote.The shared object hooks functions from three libraries\u2013libc, libcap and Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM). Once this is done, the existing processes that use these functions will essentially use the modified functions, and new processes will be hooked with the malicious library as well, researchers found.This hooking allows the malware to infect the whole machine and harvest credentials, evade detection, gain persistence, and provide remote access to the attackers, Fishbein wrote.Evasion TacticsOrbit also hooks multiple functions as its strategy to evade detection, thus preventing them from releasing information that might reveal the existence of the malicious shared library either in the running processes or the files in use by Orbit, researchers noted.\u201cThe malware uses a hardcoded GID value (the one set by the dropper) to identify the files and processes that are related to the malware and based on that it will manipulate the behavior of the hooked functions,\u201d Fishbein wrote. In Linux, a GID is a numeric value used to represent a specific group.As an example of this functionality, Orbit hooks readdir\u2014a Linux function that returns a pointer to a dirent structure describing the next directory entry in the directory stream associated with dirp\u2013to check the GID of the calling process, she explained.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t match the hardcoded value, all of the directories with the predefined GID value will be omitted from the function\u2019s output,\u201d Fishbein wrote.Register Now for this On-demand Event: Join Threatpost and Intel Security\u2019s Tom Garrison in a Threatpost roundtable discussing innovation enabling stakeholders to stay ahead of a dynamic threat landscape.

        "raw text": "A new Linux malware that\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible to detect\u201d can harvest credentials and gives attackers remote access and rootkit functionality by acting in a parasitic way to infect targets, researchers said.Researchers from The BlackBerry Research and Intelligence Team have been tracking the malware, the earliest detection of which is from November 2021, security researcher Joakim Kennedy wrote in a blog post on the BlackBerry Threat Vector Blog published last week.Researchers have appropriately dubbed the malware\u2014which apparently was written to target the financial sector in Latin America\u2014\u201dSymbiote.\u201d In biology, the word means an organism that lives in symbiosis with another organism.The name is an homage to how the malware operates, which is differently than other Linux malware that researchers have encountered, Kennedy explained.\u201cWhat makes Symbiote different \u2026 is that it needs to infect other running processes to inflict damage on infected machines,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead of being a standalone executable file that is run to infect a machine, it is a shared object (SO) library that is loaded into all running processes using LD_PRELOAD (T1574.006), and parasitically infects the machine.\u201dOnce Symbiote has infected all the running processes, a threat actor can engage in various nefarious activity, including rootkit functionality, the ability to harvest credentials, and remote access capability, Kennedy said.In addition to the rootkit capability, the malware also provides a backdoor for the threat actor to log in as any user on the machine with a hardcoded password, and to execute commands with the highest privileges, he added.Evasive Maneuvers Symbiote\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t the only thing that makes it unique, researchers said. It\u2019s also highly evasive to such a degree that it\u2019s \u201clikely to fly under the radar,\u201d making it extremely difficult to know if it\u2019s even being used by threat actors at all, he said.Some evasive tactics it uses is that by design, it is loaded by the linker via the LD_PRELOAD directive, which allows it to be loaded before any other shared objects, researchers found. This privilege of being loaded first allows it to hijack the imports from the other library files loaded for the application, they said. In this way, it hide its presence on the machine by hooking libc and libpcap functions, Kennedy said.\u201cOnce the malware has infected a machine, it hides itself and any other malware used by the threat actor, making infections very hard to detect,\u201d he explained. \u201cPerforming live forensics on an infected machine may not turn anything up since all the file, processes, and network artifacts are hidden by the malware.\u201dIn fact, researchers said they themselves could not uncover enough evidence to determine whether threat actors are currently using Symbiote \u201d in highly targeted or broad attacks,\u201d he said.Unusual DNS requests may be one way to detect if the malware is present on a system, researchers noted. However, typical antivirus or other security tools aimed at endpoint detection and response won\u2019t pick up Symbiote, making organizations using Linux that rely on those protections at risk, they said.ObjectivesAttackers\u2019 key objectives for wielding Symbiote are \u201cto capture credentials and to facilitate backdoor access to infected machines,\u201d Kennedy noted. He outlined in detail how the malware achieves both of these activities.For credential harvesting, Symbiote hooks the libc read function; if an ssh or scp process is calling the function, it captures the credentials, which are first encrypted with RC4 using an embedded key and then written to a file, Kennedy said.Attackers not only steal the credentials locally for access but also exfiltrate them by hex encoding and chunking up the data to be sent via DNS address record requests to a domain name that they control, he added.To gain remote access to an infected machine, the malware hooks a few Linux Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) functions, which allows it to authenticate to the machine with any service that uses PAM\u2014including remote services such as Secure Shell (SSH), Kennedy said.\u201cWhen a service tries to use PAM to authenticate a user, the malware checks the provided password against a hardcoded password,\u201d he explained. \u201d If the password provided is a match, the hooked function returns a success response.\u201dOnce the threat actor has accomplished authentication, Symbiote allows for an attacker to gain root privileges by scanning the environment for the variable HTTP_SETTHIS, Kennedy said.\u201cIf the variable is set with content, the malware changes the effective user and group ID to the root user, and then clears the variable before executing the content via the system command,\u201d he explained.Malware",

        "raw text": "International law enforcement has taken down the infrastructure behind Flubot, a nasty piece of malware which had been spreading with unprecedented speed across Android devices globally since December 2020.Europol revealed Wednesday that a collaboration between law enforcement in 11 countries led to the disruption of the Flubot network in early May by Dutch Police, or Politie, \u201crendering this strain of malware inactive,\u201d according to the agency.Law enforcement authorities of Australia, Belgium, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United States, coordinated by Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), participated in the effort.Specifically, EC3 teamed with national investigators in affected countries to establish a joint strategy and provided digital forensic support, as well as facilitated the exchange of operational information across various national entities, the agency said.The international law-enforcement team will continue to seek the individuals behind the campaign, who are still at large, according to Europol.Spreading Like WildfireFlubot spread via text messages that baited Android users into clicking on a link and installing an application to track to a package delivery or listen to a fake voicemail message. These malicious links installed the FluBot trojan, which then asked for permissions on the device that led to a variety of nefarious and fraudulent behavior.While FluBot acted like a typical trojan\u2014stealing various credentials to banking apps or cryptocurrency accounts and disabling built-in security\u2013its operators used unique methods to ensure the malware spread like wildfire.Once installed on a device, Flubot would access a user\u2019s contact list and begin sending new messages to everyone on the list, creating a dynamic, viral effect that transcended time zones or regions, researchers from BitDefender observed in January.\u201cThese threats survive because they come in waves with different messages and in different time zones,\u201d they wrote in a report published at the time. \u201cWhile the malware itself remains pretty static, the message used to carry it, the domains that host the droppers, and everything else is constantly changing.\u201dThis feature is what allowed Flubot\u2019s operators to quickly change targets and other malware features on the fly, which broadened their attack surface from geographical regions as disparate as New Zealand and Finland in a flash, researchers noted.Changing Tactics and Sharing NetworksIn addition to using targets\u2019 own contact lists to propagate the malware, Flubot operators employed some unique and creative tactics to try to dupe Android users into downloading the trojan and even teamed up with another mobile threat during its global campaign.Last October, Flubot used a fake security warning trying to trick users into thinking they\u2019d already been infected with Flubot to get them to click on a fake security update spread via SMS. The unique tactic was used in a campaign against Android users in New Zealand.Several months later in February of this year, Flubot hitched its infrastructure wagon up to another mobile threat known as Medusa, a mobile banking trojan that can gain near-complete control over a user\u2019s device, researchers from ThreatFabric discovered. The partnership resulted in high-volume, side-by-side global malware campaigns.Indeed, even with Flubot out of the picture, there are still a number of threats of which Android users need to be wary. An IoT malware that can exploit existing vulnerabilities dubbed \u201cEnemyBot\u201d recently emerged that\u2019s targeting Android devices as well as content management systems and web servers.Other pervasive threats such as the Joker fleeceware and malware that can conduct fraudulent transactions on an infected device such as Octo and Ermac also continue to pose a significant risk for Android users, according to a recent report on current mobile threats by ThreatFabric.\u00a0Malware",

The Keksec group distributes the malware by targeting Linux machines and IoT devices, this threat group was formed back in 2016 and includes several botnet actors.EnemyBot WorkingThe Alien lab research team study found four main sections of the malware.The first section is a python script \u2018cc7.py\u2019, used to download all dependencies and compile the malware into different OS architectures (x86, ARM, macOS, OpenBSD, PowerPC, MIPS). After compilation, a batch file \u201cupdate.sh\u201d is created and used to spread the malware to vulnerable targets.The second section is the main botnet source code, which includes all the other functionality of the malware excluding the main part and incorporates source codes of the various botnets that can combine to perform an attack.The third module is obfuscation segment \u201chide.c\u201d and is compiled and executed manually to encode /decode the malware strings. A simple swap table is used to hide strings and \u201ceach char is replaced with a corresponding char in the table\u201d according to researchers.The last segment includes a command-and-control (CC) component to receive vital actions and payloads from attackers.AT&T researcher\u2019s further analysis revealed a new scanner function to hunt vulnerable IP addresses and an \u201cadb_infect\u201d function that is used to attack Android devices.ADB or Android Debug Bridge is a command-line tool that allows you to communicate with a device.\u201cIn case an Android device is connected through USB, or Android emulator running on the machine, EnemyBot will try to infect it by executing shell command,\u201d said the researcher.\u201cKeksec\u2019s EnemyBot appears to be just starting to spread, however due to the authors\u2019 rapid updates, this botnet has the potential to become a major threat for IoT devices and web servers,\u201d the researchers added.This Linux-based botnet EnemyBot was first discovered by Securonix in March 2022, and later in-depth analysis was done by Fortinet.Vulnerabilities Currently Exploited by EnemyBotThe AT&T researchers release a list of vulnerabilities that are currently exploited by the Enemybot, some of them are not assigned a CVE yet.The list includes Log4shell vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046), F5 BIG IP devices (CVE-2022-1388), and others. Some of the vulnerabilities were not assigned a CVE yet such as PHP Scriptcase and Adobe ColdFusion 11.Log4shell vulnerability \u2013 CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046F5 BIG IP devices \u2013 CVE-2022-1388Spring Cloud Gateway \u2013 CVE-2022-22947TOTOLink A3000RU wireless router \u2013 CVE-2022-25075Kramer VIAWare \u2013 CVE-2021-35064\u201cThis indicates that the Keksec group is well resourced and that the group has developed the malware to take advantage of vulnerabilities before they are patched, thus increasing the speed and scale at which it can spread,\u201d the researcher explained.Recommended Actions\u00a0The Alien lab researcher suggests methods to protect from the exploitation. Users are advised to use a properly configured firewall and focus on reducing Linux server and IOT devices\u2019 exposure to the internet.Another action recommended is to monitor the network traffic, scan the outbound ports and look for the suspicious bandwidth usage. Software should be updated automatically and patched with the latest security update.IoTMalware",

        "raw text": "Recently reported VMware bugs are being used by hackers who are focused on using them to deliver Mirai denial-of-service malware and exploit the Log4Shell vulnerability.Security researchers at Barracuda discovered that attempts were made to exploit the recent vulnerabilities CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960, both reported last month.\u201cBarracuda researchers analyzed the attacks and payloads detected by Barracuda systems between April to May and found a steady stream of attempts to exploit two recently uncovered VMware vulnerabilities: CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960\u201d reported by Barracuda.VMware published an advisory on April 6, 2022, which detailed multiple security vulnerabilities. The most severe of these is CVE-2022-22954 with a CVSS score of 9.8, the bug allows an attacker with network access to perform remote code execution via server-side template injection on VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager Solutions.The other bug involved CVE-2022-22960 (CVSS score 7.8), is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access, Identity Manager, and vRealize Automation. According to the advisory by VMware, the bug arises due to improper permission in support scripts allowing an attacker with local access to gain root privileges.The VMware Workspace One is an intelligent-drive workspace platform that helps to manage any app on any device in a secure and simpler manner. The Identity manager handles the authentication to the platform and vRealize Automation is a DevOps-based infrastructure management platform for config of IT resources and automating the delivery of container-based applications.Exploitation Occurred After PoC ReleaseThe Barracuda researchers noted that the previous flaws are chained together for a potential full exploitation vector.After the bug was disclosed by VMware in April, a proof-of-concept (PoC) was released on Github and shared via Twitter.\u201cBarracuda researchers started seeing probes and exploit attempts for this vulnerability soon after the release of the advisory and the initial release of the proof of concept on GitHub,\u201d reported Barracuda.After the release of PoC, the spike in attempts is noticed by the researcher, they classified it as a probe rather than actual attempts to exploit.\u201cThe attacks have been consistent over time, barring a few spikes, and the vast majority of them are what would be classified as probes rather than actual exploit attempts,\u201d they added.The researchers at Barracuda also revealed that most of the exploit attempts are primarily from botnet operators, the IPs discovered still seem to host variants of the Mirai distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet malware, along with some Log4Shell exploits and low levels of EnemyBot (a type of DDoS botnet) attempts.The majority of the attacks (76 percent) originated from the U.S. geographically, with most of them coming from data centers and cloud providers. The researcher added that there is a spike in IP addresses from the UK and Russia and about (6 percent) of the attacks emanate from these locations.The researchers noted, \u201cthere are also consistent background attempts from known bad IPs in Russia.\u201d\u201cSome of these IPs perform scans for specific vulnerabilities at regular intervals, and it looks like the VMware vulnerabilities have been added to their usual rotating list of Laravel/Drupal/PHP probes,\u201d researchers explainedAccording to Barracuda \u201cthe interest levels on these vulnerabilities have stabilized\u201d after the initial spike in April, the researcher expected to analyze low-level scanning and attempts for some time.The best way to protect the systems is to apply the patches immediately, especially if the system is internet-facing, and to place a Web application firewall (WAF) in front of such systems \u201cwill add to defense in depth against zero-day attacks and other vulnerabilities, including Log4Shell,\u201d advised by Barracuda.MalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Cybercriminals are promoting a new, modular malware-as-a-service offering that allows would-be attackers to choose from a cornucopia of threats via a Telegram channel that to date has more than 500 subscribers, researchers have found.The new malware service, dubbed the Eternity Project by the threat actors behind it, allows cybercriminals to target potential victims with a customized threat offering based on individual modules they can buy for prices ranging from $90 to $490, researchers from security firm Cyble wrote in a blog post published Thursday.The modules include a stealer, clipper, worm, miner and ransomware, depending on what type of attack a threat actors wants to mount, according to the post. Developers behind the project also are working on a future module that offers distributed denial of service (DDoS) bots.\nEternity\u2014which researchers discovered on a TOR website, where the malware-as-a-service also is for sale\u2014demonstrates the \u201csignificant increase in cybercrime through Telegram channels and cybercrime forums,\u201d researchers wrote in the post. This is likely because threat actors can sell their products without any regulation, they said.Each module is sold individually and has different functionality that researchers suspect is being repurposed from code in an existing \u00a0Github repository, which project developers are then modifying and selling under a new name, according to Cyble.\u201cOur analysis also indicated that the Jester Stealer could also be rebranded from this particular Github project which indicates some links between the two threat actors,\u201d they wrote.Specific Modules and FunctionalityThreat actors are selling the Eternity Stealer for $260 as an annual subscription. The module steals passwords, cookies, credit cards and crypto-wallets from various applications\u2014such as all the most popular browsers, messaging apps and cryptocurrency wallets\u2014on the victim\u2019s machine and sends them to the threat actor\u2019s Telegram Bot.The Eternity Miner, a malicious program that uses the infected device to mine cryptocurrency, sells for $90 for an annual subscription. Features of the miner include a small file size; silent Monero mining; the ability to restart when killed; and the ability to remain hidden from the task manager, researchers wrote.The Eternity Clipper\u2013malware that monitors the clipboard of an infected machine for cryptocurrency wallets and replaces them with the threat actor\u2019s crypto-wallet addresses\u2013is being sold for $110. The malware, like the miner, also can hide from the task manager, as well as includes other features.The Eternity Ransomware\u2014the most expensive of the offerings\u2014sells for $490 and offers encryption of all documents, photos and databases on disks, local shares and USB drives both online and offline. Attackers can set a time limit after which the files cannot be decrypted and can set the ransomware to execute on a specific date, among other features.Threat actors are selling the Eternity Worm, a virus that spreads through infected machines via files and networks, for $390. Features of the worm include its ability to spread through the following: USB Drives, local network shares, various local files, cloud drives such as GoogleDrive or DropBox, and others. It also can send worm-infected messages to people\u2019s Discord and Telegram channels and friends, researchers said.As mentioned before, developers are currently working on another module to offer DDoS bots as a service, though researchers did not specific a time frame for its availability.Proceed with CautionThe existence of Eternity and its ability to offer cyber-crime options to the masses should be a cautionary tale to web users never to save credentials on a machine, lest the information falls into the wrong hands, one security professional noted.\u201cSeriously, when your browser asks you to allow it to remember your credentials, your answer should always be \u2018no, or never,'\u201d Ron Bradley, vice president at Shared Assessments, wrote in an email to Threatpost. \u201cUnfortunately, browser manufacturers have duped users into a sense of security by allowing them to remember sensitive information including passwords, credit cards, addresses, etc. without regard to the risk they are taking.\u201dPeople should work on the assumption that their credentials have already been compromised rather than feeling a false sense of safety with saving sensitive data to a machine, and take steps to protect private information that reflects this assumption, he said.\u201cAbove all else, use multiple layers of defense,\u201d Bradley observed. \u201cLike it or not, we\u2019re at war when it comes to protecting our private information. Protective gear and defensive weapons are not optional in this day and age.\u201dMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "On April 23rd, 2022, a Discord user with the handle \u201cPortu\u201d began advertising a new password-stealing malware builder.Malware builders are programs which so-called script kiddie hackers can craft their own executables on top of. Script kiddie is cybersecurity parlance for a novice hacker who uses a preexisting code to slightly modify it for their own nefarious purposes.Four days later, threat analysts from Uptycs discovered the first sample of a Portu-inspired malware sample in the wild researchers dubbed \u201cKurayStealer.\u201d According to researchers, the malware has been used to target Discord users.How KurayStealer WorksThe author behind KurayStealer has clearly taken inspiration \u2013 and code \u2013 from those other attacks. \u201cWe have seen several other similar versions floating around in public repositories like github,\u201d the researchers noted, concluding that \u201cthe KurayStelaer builder has several components of different password stealers.\u201dWhen it\u2019s first executed, KurayStealer runs a check to determine if the malicious user is running the free or \u201cVIP\u201d (paid) version.Next, it attempts to replace the string \u201capi/webhooks\u201d with \u201cKisses\u201d in BetterDiscord \u2013 an extended version of the Discord app, with greater functionality for developers. If this action is successful, the hacker can undermine the app in order to set up webhooks.Webhooks are a mechanism by which webpages and applications can send real-time data to one another over HTTP. They\u2019re like APIs, the key difference being that webhooks send information automatically, without the need for a request from the receiver.With webhooks in place, the program takes a screenshot and grabs the geo-location of the target machine. Then it begins credential hunting: probing for passwords, tokens, IP addresses and more from Discord, Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and 18 other apps. Any data scoured in this process funnels back to the attacker via the webhooks.What We Know of the AuthorScript kiddies are rarely subtle.Within KurayStealer\u2019s code is a reference to who wrote it: \u201cSuleymansha & Portu,\u201d and an invite to a Discord channel run by the user \u201cPortu#0022.\u201d Portu#0022\u2019s profile contains a link to their profile on Shoppy \u2013 an ecommerce platform \u2013 with samples of other malicious programs. It also points to their YouTube channel, which used to have a video up that demonstrated how to use KurayStealer. The channel is barren now, but for a cartoon profile picture and an indication that Portu is from Spain.On April 26th, Portu announced they were working on a new ransomware program. \u201cBased on the announcement and the observations,\u201d the researchers concluded, \u201cwe believe that the authors might come up with newer versions of password stealers and other malware.\u201d\u201cOur research on KurayStealer backed with OSINT highlights the rise in prevalence of password stealers using Discord tokens as a C2 for harvesting the victims\u2019 credentials. Enterprises must have tight security controls and multi-layered visibility and security solutions to identify and detect such attacks.\u201dHacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Credit: Red CanaryWormable malware dubbed Raspberry Robin has been active since last September and\u00a0 is wriggling its way through USB drives onto Windows machines to use Microsoft Standard Installer and other legitimate processes to install malicious files, researchers have found.Researchers at Red Canary Intelligence first began tracking the malicious activity in the fall when it began as a handful of detections with similar characteristics first observed in multiple customers\u2019 environments by Jason Killam from Red Canary\u2019s Detection Engineering team.Once the worm spreads via a USB drive to someone\u2019s machine, the activity relies on msiexec.exe to call out to its infrastructure\u2013which is often comprised of QNAP devices\u2013using HTTP requests that contain a victim\u2019s user and device names, Red Canary\u2019s Lauren Podber and Stef Rand wrote in a blog post published Thursday.Researchers also observed Raspberry Robin use TOR exit nodes as additional command and control (C&C) infrastructure, they wrote. Eventually the worm installs malicious dynamic link library (DLL) files found on the infected USB.While researchers first noticed Raspberry Robin as early as September 2021, most of the activity observed by Red Canary occurred during January of this year, researchers said.Unanswered QuestionsThough researchers observed various processes and executions by the malicious activity, they acknowledged that these observations have left a number of unanswered questions.The team has not yet figured out how or where Raspberry Robin infects external drives to perpetuate its activity, though it\u2019s likely this infection occurs offline or \u201cotherwise outside of our visibility,\u201d researchers said.They also don\u2019t know why Raspberry Robin installs a malicious DLL, although they believe it may be to \u00a0attempt to establish persistence on an infected system\u2013though there is not enough evidence to make this conclusive, researchers acknowledged.However, the biggest question mark surrounding the worm is the objective of the threat actors behind it, researchers said.\u201cAbsent additional information on later-stage activity, it\u2019s difficult to make inferences on the goal or goals of these campaigns,\u201d they acknowledged.Initial Access and ExecutionInfected removable drives\u2014typically USB devices\u2014introduce the Raspberry Robin worm as a shortcut LNK file masquerading as a legitimate folder on the infected USB device, researchers said. LNK files are Windows shortcuts that point to and are used to open another file, folder, or application.Soon after the infected drive is connected to the system, the worm updates the UserAssist registry entry and records execution of a ROT13-ciphered value referencing a LNK file when deciphered. For example, researchers observed the value q:\\erpbirel.yax being deciphered to d:\\recovery.lnk, they wrote.Execution commences when Raspberry Robin uses cmd.exe to read and execute a file stored on the infected external drive, researchers said.\u201cThe command is consistent across Raspberry Robin detections we have seen so far, making it reliable early evidence of potential [worm] activity,\u201d they noted.In the next phase of execution, cmd.exe typically launches explorer.exe and msiexec.exe. The former\u2019s command line can be a mixed-case reference to an external device\u2013a person\u2019s name, like LAUREN V; or the name of the LNK file, researchers said.The worm \u201calso extensively uses mixed-case letters in its commands,\u201d most likely to avoid detection, researchers added.Secondary ExecutionRaspberry Robin uses the second executable launched, msiexec.exe , to attempt external network communication to a malicious domain for command and control purposes, researchers revealed.In several examples of the activity that researchers have observed, the worm has used msiexec.exe to install a malicious DLL file although, as mentioned before, they still aren\u2019t certain what the purpose of the DLL is.The worm also uses msiexec.exe to launch a legitimate Windows utility, fodhelper.exe, which in turn spawns rundll32.exe to execute a malicious command, they observed.\u201cProcesses launched by fodhelper.exe run with elevated administrative privileges without requiring a User Account Control prompt,\u201d researchers noted. As this is unusual behavior for the utility, this activity can be used to detect the presence of Raspberry Robin on an infected machine, they said.The rundll32.exe command then starts another legitimate Windows utility\u2013 odbcconf.exe\u2013and passes in additional commands to execute and configure the recently-installed malicious DLL file, researchers said.HacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a malicious campaign utilizing a never-before-seen technique for quietly planting fileless malware on target machines.The technique involves injecting shellcode directly into Windows event logs. This allows adversaries to use the Windows event logs as a cover for malicious late stage trojans, according to a Kaspersky research report released Wednesday.Researchers uncovered the campaign in February and believe the unidentified adversaries have been active for the past month.\u201cWe consider the event logs technique, which we haven\u2019t seen before, the most innovative part of this campaign,\u201d wrote Denis Legezo, senior security researcher with Kaspersky\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team.The attackers behind the campaign use a series of injection tools and anti-detection technique to deliver the malware payload. \u201cWith at least two commercial products in use, plus several types of last-stage RAT and anti-detection wrappers, the actor behind this campaign is quite capable,\u201d Legezo wrote.Fileless Malware Hides in Plain Sight (Event Logs)The first stage of the attack involves the adversary driving targets to a legitimate website and enticing the target to download a compressed .RAR file boobytrapped with the network penetration testing tools called Cobalt Strike and SilentBreak. Both tools are popular among hackers who use them as a vehicle for delivering shellcode to target machines.Cobalt Strike and SilentBreak utilizing separate anti-detection AES decryptors, compiled with Visual Studio.The digital certificate for the Cobalt Strike module varies. According to Kaspersky, \u201c15 different stagers from wrappers to last stagers were signed.\u201dNext, attackers are then able to leverage Cobalt Strike and SilentBreak to \u201cinject code into any process\u201d and can inject additional modules into Windows system processes or trusted applications such as DLP.\u201cThis layer of infection chain decrypts, maps into memory and launches the code,\u201d they said.The ability to inject malware into system\u2019s memory classifies it as fileless. As the name suggests, fileless malware infects targeted computers leaving behind no artifacts on the local hard drive, making it easy to sidestep traditional signature-based security and forensics tools. The technique, where attackers hide their activities in a computer\u2019s random-access memory and use a native Windows tools such as PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), isn\u2019t new.What is new is new, however, is how the encrypted shellcode containing the malicious payload is embedded into Windows event logs. To avoid detection, the code \u201cis divided into 8 KB blocks and saved in the binary part of event logs.\u201dLegezo said, \u201cThe dropper not only puts the launcher on disk for side-loading, but also writes information messages with shellcode into existing Windows KMS event log.\u201d\u201cThe dropped wer.dll is a loader and wouldn\u2019t do any harm without the shellcode hidden in Windows event logs,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe dropper searches the event logs for records with category 0x4142 (\u201cAB\u201d in ASCII) and having the Key Management Service as a source. If none is found, the 8KB chunks of shellcode are written into the information logging messages via the ReportEvent() Windows API function (lpRawData parameter).\u201dNext, a launcher is dropped into the Windows Tasks directory. \u201cAt the entry point, a separate thread combines all the aforementioned 8KB pieces into a complete shellcode and runs it,\u201d the researcher wrote.\u201cSuch attention to the event logs in the campaign isn\u2019t limited to storing shellcodes,\u201d the researchers added. \u201cDropper modules also patch Windows native API functions, related to event tracing (ETW) and anti-malware scan interface (AMSI), to make the infection process stealthier.Unidentified Adversary Delivers Payload of PainUsing this stealthy approach, the attackers can deliver either of their two remote access trojans (RATs), each one a combination of complex, custom code and elements of publicly available software.In all, with their \u201cability to inject code into any process using Trojans, the attackers are free to use this feature widely to inject the next modules into Windows system processes or trusted applications.\u201dAttribution in cyberspace is tricky. The best that analysts can do is dig deep into attackers\u2019 tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), and the code they write. If those TTPs or that code overlaps with past campaigns from known actors, it might be the basis for incriminating a suspect.In this case, the researchers found attribution difficult.That\u2019s because, beyond the unprecedented technique of injecting shellcode into Windows event logs, there\u2019s one other unique component to this campaign: the code itself. While the droppers are commercially available products, the anti-detection wrappers and RATs they come paired with are custom made (though, the researchers hedged, \u201csome modules which we consider custom, such as wrappers and last stagers, could possibly be parts of commercial products\u201d).According to the report, \u201cthe code is quite unique, with no similarities to known malware.\u201d For that reason, the researchers have yet to determine the identity of the attackers.\u201cIf new modules appear and allow us to connect the activity to some actor we will update the name accordingly.\u201dHacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Sophisticated hackers believed to be tied to the North Korean government are actively targeting journalists with novel malware dubbed Goldbackdoor. Attacks have consisted of multistage infection campaign with the ultimate goal of stealing sensitive information from targets. The campaign is believed to have started in March and is ongoing, researchers have found.Researchers at Stairwell followed up on an initial report from South Korea\u2019s NK News, which revealed that a North Korean APT known as APT37 had stolen info from the private computer of a former South Korean intelligence official. The threat actor\u2013also known as Ricochet Collima, InkySquid, Reaper or ScarCruft\u2014attempted to impersonate NK News and distributed what appeared to be a novel malware in an attempt to target journalists who were using the official as a source, according to the report.NK News passed details to Stairwell for further investigation. Researchers from the cybersecurity firm uncovered specific details of the malware, called Goldbackdoor. The malware is likely a successor of the Bluelight malware, according to a report they published late last week.\n\u201cThe Goldbackdoor malware shares strong technical overlaps with the Bluelight malware,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThese overlaps, along with the suspected shared development resource and impersonation of NK News, support our attribution of Goldbackdoor to APT37.\u201dAPT37 was previously seen using Bluelight as a secondary payload last August in a series of watering hole attacks against a South Korean newspaper that used known Internet Explorer vulnerabilities.As Stairwell researchers noted, journalists are \u201chigh-value targets for hostile governments,\u201d and often the target of cyber-espionage attacks. In fact, one of the biggest security stories of last year was various governments\u2019 use of the NGO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware against journalists, among other targets.\u201c[Journalists] often are aggregators of stories from many individuals\u2013sometimes including those with sensitive access,\u201d Stairwell researchers wrote. \u201cCompromising a journalist can provide access to highly-sensitive information and enable additional attacks against their sources.\u201dMulti-Stage MalwareThe current campaign saga unfolded beginning March 18, when NK News shared \u201cmultiple malicious artifacts with the Stairwell threat research team from a spear-phishing campaign targeting journalists who specialize in the DPRK,\u201d researchers wrote. The messages were sent from the personal email of a former director of South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, NIS.\u201cOne of these artifacts was a new malware sample we have named Goldbackdoor, based on an embedded development artifact,\u201d they wrote.Goldbackdoor is a multi-stage malware that separates the first stage tooling and the final payload, which allows the threat actor to halt deployment after initial targets are infected, researchers said.\u201cAdditionally, this design may limit the ability to conduct retrospective analysis once payloads are removed from control infrastructure,\u201d they wrote in the report.The malware, like Bluelight before it, uses cloud service providers for receiving actor commands and exfiltrating data. The sample specifically analyzed by researchers used Microsoft OneDrive and Graph APIs, while an additional identified sample SHA256 hash used Google Drive.Embedded within the malware are a set of API keys used to authenticate against Microsoft\u2019s cloud computing platform Azure and retrieve commands for execution, researchers said.\u201cGoldbackdoor provides attackers with basic remote command execution, file downloading/uploading, keylogging, and the ability to remotely uninstall,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis functionality and implementation closely match Bluelight; however, the increased focus appears to have been placed on file collection and keylogging.\u201dStage OneGoldbackdoor is a sophisticated malware that researchers broke down into two stages. In stage one, a victim must download a ZIP file from a compromised site, https[:]//main[.]dailynk[.]us/regex?id=oTks2&file=Kang Min-chol Edits2.zip, which executes a compressed Windows shortcut.\u201cThe domain dailynk[.]us was likely chosen to impersonate NK News (dailynk[.]com),\u201d researchers said, and had been previously used by APT37 in a previous campaign.Stairwell researchers retrieved the ZIP file for analysis from a DNS history of the site, which had stopped resolving already by the time of their investigation. They identified that the file was created on March 17 and contained a 282.7 MB Windows shortcut file LNK named Kang Min-chol Edits, likely a reference to Kang Min-chol, North Korea\u2019s Minister of Mining Industries.\u201cThe attackers masqueraded this shortcut as a document, using both the icon for Microsoft Word and adding comments similar to a Word document,\u201d researchers wrote.They also padded the LNK file 0x90, or NOP/No Operation, bytes to artificially increase the size of this file, potentially as a means of preventing upload to detection services or malware repositories they said.Once executed, the LNK executes a PowerShell script that writes and opens a decoy document before starting the deployment process of Goldbackdoor, researchers said.Stage TwoAfter deploying the decoy document, the PowerShell script decodes a second PowerShell script that then will download and execute a shellcode payload XOR\u2014named \u201cFantasy\u201d stored on Microsoft OneDrive.\u00a0That Fantasy payload is the second stage of the malware\u2019s process, and the first of a two-part final process for deploying Goldbackdoor, researchers said.\u201cBoth parts are written in position-independent code (shellcode) containing an embedded payload, and use process injection to deploy Goldbackdoor,\u201d they wrote.Fantasy parses and decodes the payload and uses a standard process involving VirtualAllocEx,WriteProcessMemory, and RtlCreateUserThread to spawn a thread under the previously created process in order to execute it, researchers said.The final dropper is a shellcode payload running as that thread in a process created by Fantasy to execute the final deployment of the malware.\u201cThe payload delivered by this stage is a Windows Portable Executable PE file for Goldbackdoor,\u201d researchers wrote.GovernmentHacks",

        "raw text": "Where\u2019s the last place you\u2019d expect to find malware? In an email from your mother? Embedded in software you trust and use everyday (actually, that\u2019s probably the first place you should look)? How about in a technical documentation file?In a report published Thursday, Trustwave SpiderLabs revealed a new phishing attack designed to plant the Vidar infostealer on target machines. The trick to this particular campaign is that it conceals its complex malware behind a Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (.CHM) file, Microsoft\u2019s proprietary file format for help documentation saved in HTML. In other words, it\u2019s the kind of file you almost never look at or even think about.After all, what better place to hide something interesting than within something boring? That\u2019s just what cyberattackers have done in a recent spate of data-stealing attacks: leverage .CHM files in a nested attack that prioritizes obfuscation.The Latest PhishSome threat actors will dedicate a tremendous amount of effort to diligently crafting a perfect phishing email. They copy a well-known brand\u2019s graphics to a tee, and compose a perfect message conveying legitimacy and professionalism, but also urgency.Not so here. If the attackers in this case spent any more than three minutes crafting their phishing email, it doesn\u2019t show.The subject line \u2013 \u201cRe: Not read: Coverage Inquiry 3.24.16\u201d \u2013 goes some way to implying that an ongoing discourse is occurring (\u201cRe\u201d), and that the recipient must take action (\u201cNot read\u201d) \u2013 and is otherwise vague enough to not arouse immediate suspicion. The body of the email does even less:The important information for you. See the attachment to the email.Thank You!Said attachment appears to the recipient as \u201crequest.doc,\u201d but is, in fact, an .ISO file, Trustwave noted in its analysis. ISOs are used to copy the information on physical optical discs into a single file. However, as the report notes, hackers have learned how to repurpose ISO files as malware containers. According to Trustwave, there was a \u201cnotable uptick\u201d in this strategy beginning in 2019. Vidar itself started gaining popularity around the same time.The Vidar MalwareVidar is a kind of jack-of-all-trades infostealer, forked from the Arkei malware family. As Threatpost has explained in the past, just after it was first discovered:Vidar steals documents, cookies and browser histories (including from Tor), currency from a wide array of cryptocurrency wallets, data from two-factor authentication software and text messages, plus it can take screenshots. The package also offers malware operators Telegram notifications for important logs. And lastly, threat actors can customize the stealer via profiles, which allows them to specify the kind of data they are interested in.In this latest campaign, the .ISO file contains a .CHM file named \u201cpss10r.chm.\u201d Towards the end of the file\u2019s code is a snippet of HTML application (HTA) code containing JavaScript \u00a0that covertly triggers a second file, \u201capp.exe.\u201d This is, in fact, Vidar malware.\u201cOne of the objects unpacked from the .CHM is the HTML file \u2018PSSXMicrosoftSupportServices_HP05221271.htm\u2019 \u2014\u00a0 the primary object that gets loaded once the CHM pss10r.chm is opened,\u201d according to the Trustwave writeup. \u201cThis HTML has a button object which automatically triggers the silent re-execution of the .CHM \u201cpss10r.chm\u201d with mshta.\u201d Mshta is a Windows binary used for executing HTA files.As soon as app.exe triggers, Vidar downloads its dependencies and configuration settings from a command-and-control (C2) server, which is retrieved from Mastodon, an open-source social networking platform. The malware then searches two hard-coded profiles and nabs the C2 address from the Bio section.A Mastodon profile containing Vidar\u2019s C2 information. Source: Trustwave.Then, Vidar gets to stealing. Any information it sucks up gets sent back to the C2. \u00a0Vidar can also download additional malware to the target machine. Once the job is done, the malware covers its tracks by deleting all the files it\u2019s created.This nested approach and the use of unassuming Help files is all in the name of obfuscation, of course.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this technique used quite a bit recently,\u201d Karl Sigler, senior security research manager at Trustwave SpiderLabs, told Threatpost via email, \u201cand the various attempts at nesting the attack (from .ISO to .CHM to .HTA to JavaScript to execution) shows the lengths that these actors are going to try to obfuscate and hide their attack.\u201dHe concluded quite simply. \u201cThis TTP is really popular right now.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

Still Recognized Certs: A \u2018Significant Threat\u2019Both of the stolen NVIDIA code-signing certificates are expired, but they\u2019re still recognized by Windows, which allow a driver signed with the certificates to be loaded in the operating system, according to reports.According to security researchers Kevin Beaumont and Will Dormann, the stolen certificates use these serial numbers:43BB437D609866286DD839E1D00309F514781bc862e8dc503a559346f5dcc518Casey Bisson, head of product and developer relations at code-security product provider BluBracket, called the certificate theft a \u201csignificant threat.\u201d\u201cSigning certificates are the keys computers use to verify trust in software,\u201d he told Threatpost via email on Monday. \u201cValidating code signatures is a critical step in securing the global code supply chain, and it protects everybody from average consumers running Windows Updates (where signatures are validated automatically) to developers using software components in larger projects (where signatures are hopefully checked as part of the CI process).\u201dMike Parkin, senior technical engineer at enterprise cyber risk remediation provider Vulcan Cyber, agreed that malware authors being able to use legitimate certificates to sign their code \u201ccan have far -reaching consequences.The dire situation is somewhat mitigated due to the stolen certificates having expired, he said in an email on Monday, but that\u2019s not a perfect solution. \u201cThis will make it easier for anti-malware applications to identify malicious code signed with these certs, but there is still the challenge of Microsoft\u2019s operating systems accepting them as valid even past their expiration,\u201d he said.Supply ChainBisson noted that given NVIDIA\u2019s massive install base \u2013 its technology shows up everywhere from gaming to crypto miners to industrial and scientific super-computing \u2013 a supply chain attack targeting users could have \u201cenormous implications.\u201dHe pointed to global power consumption as one yardstick of how NVIDIA\u2019s hardware is slathered across the world: \u201cSome estimates peg crypto as consuming over half a percent of the world\u2019s annual electric generation on its own,\u201d he said, \u201cmost of that related to power-hungry Nvidia processors dependent on Nvidia\u2019s software signed by these keys.\u201dNVIDIA\u2019s hardware is critical for gaming and media production, as well as cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML) that powers everything from voice assistants, image and video processing (including automated moderation), and manufacturing quality control systems, Bisson pointed out.He suggested that the fix for supply-chain threats is to establish a new chain of trust in NVIDIA\u2019s software development workflow with new certificates. \u201cUpstream certificate authorities can revoke Nvidia\u2019s old certificates to block installation of any potentially compromised software with those certificates,\u201d he explained. \u201cAs always, intrusion detection and access control audits are critical to preventing new intrusion attacks, while enforcing signed commits and continuous automated code scanning for secrets, dependency vulnerabilities, along with manual testing are solid steps to ensuring the security of their software.\u201dHow to Block the Signed MalwareDavid Weston, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft, tweeted on Thursday that admins can keep Windows from loading known, vulnerable drivers by configuring Windows Defender Application Control policies to control which of NVIDIA\u2019s drivers can be loaded.That should, in fact, be admins\u2019 first choice, he wrote.WDAC policies work on both 10-11 with no hardware requirements down to the home SKU despite some FUD misinformation i have seen so it should be your first choice.  Create a policy with the Wizard and then add a deny rule or allow specific versions of Nvidia if you need\u2014 David Weston (DWIZZZLE) (@dwizzzleMSFT) March 3, 2022David Weston, Microsoft vice president for OS Security and Enterprise, went on to tweet the attributes to be blocked or allowed.These are all the attributes you can block or allow on: pic.twitter.com/3BV3QoMuMX\u2014 David Weston (DWIZZZLE) (@dwizzzleMSFT) March 3, 2022Unfortunately, Microsoft\u2019s WDAC fix isn\u2019t a practical solution for the majority of Windows users, who aren\u2019t technically literate, Vulcan Cyber\u2019s Parkin pointed out.A better approach would be for\u00a0Microsoft to recognize the certificates as expired and no longer accept them as legitimate, he told Threatpost.Doxxed Emails, Password Hashes & MoreOn Feb. 27, Lapsus$ claimed that it had been in NVIDIA\u2019s systems for a week, that the gang isn\u2019t state-sponsored and that it\u2019s \u201cnot into politics AT ALL\u201d \u2013 a clarification that\u2019s apparently important for cybercrooks now that the Russia/Ukraine cyber war zone is burning at fever pitch.Last Wednesday, March 2, the compromised-email notice site Have I Been Pwned put up an alert regarding 71,335 NVIDIA employees\u2019 emails and NTLM password hashes having been leaked on Feb. 23, \u201cmany of which were subsequently cracked and circulated within the hacking community.\u201dAs has been noted, at least on the face of it, that number of 71,000 compromised employee accounts \u2013 a number that the graphics processing units maker hasn\u2019t confirmed or denied \u2013 doesn\u2019t make sense. In its most recent quarterly report (PDF), NVIDIA only listed a workforce of 18,975.But, given that the Telegraph\u2019s initial report cited an insider who said that the intrusion \u201ccompletely compromised\u201d the company\u2019s internal systems, it could be that the stolen data included former employees.Lapsus$ released a portion of the highly confidential stolen data, including source codes, GPU drivers and documentation on NVIDIA\u2019s fast logic controller product, also known as Falcon and Lite Hash Rate, or LHR GPU.Lapsus$ demanded $1 million and a percentage of an unspecified fee from NVIDIA for the Lite Hash Rate bypass.Lapsus$ also demanded that NVIDIA open-source its drivers, lest Lapsus$ do it itself.Who Is Lapsus$ Group?Lapsus$ Group emerged last year. It\u2019s probably best known for its December attack on the Brazil Ministry of Health that took down several online entities, successfully wiping out information on citizens\u2019 COVID-19 vaccination data as well as disrupting the system that issues digital vaccination certificates.In January, Lapsus$ also crippled the Portuguese media giant Impresa.Lapsus$ also recently released what is purportedly a massive dump of proprietary source code stolen from Samsung, vx-underground reported.030722 16:06 UPDATE: Added commentary from Casey Bisson and Mike Parkin.Register Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event scheduled for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

        "raw text": "Face masks not only have shown in research to slow the spread of COVID-19, they also deter facial-recognition technology from correctly identifying people, according to a new study.New research from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that even the best of 89 commercial facial recognition algorithms tested experienced error rates between 5 percent and 50 percent when matching people in digitally applied face masks with photos of the same person without a mask.The study shows the limitations of facial-recognition technology in a post-pandemic world and are aimed at developing and testing technology that takes into consideration how to identify people who are masked, said Mei Ngan, a NIST computer scientist and the report\u2019s author, in a press statement.\nShe said COVID-19 has given researchers developing facial-recognition technology a new factor to consider when creating accurate facial recognition algorithms.\u201cWe have begun by focusing on how an algorithm developed before the pandemic might be affected by subjects wearing face masks,\u201d she said. \u201cLater this summer, we plan to test the accuracy of algorithms that were intentionally developed with masked faces in mind.\u201dNIST researchers used what\u2019s called \u201cone-to-one\u201d matching to test the algorithms, which means they compared a photo of someone with a different photo of that same person. They digitally applied masks using nine mask variants in black or light blue to mimic the surgical-style masks most people wear in public.Results of the tests demonstrated a few key challenges for developers of facial-recognition algorithms to consider. The key overall finding is that algorithm accuracy when applied to masked faces declines considerably, researchers said.Even the most accurate algorithms failed to authenticate a person about 0.3% of the time, while top face-recognition technology had a failure rate of about 5 percent, according to the study. Moreover, many algorithms considered competent by researchers failed at a much higher rate, between 20 percent to 50 percent of the time.Masks also prevented the algorithms from even performing their appointed task at all, registering what\u2019s called a \u201cfailure to enroll or template,\u201d researchers said. This basically means the technology could not effectively measure a face\u2019s features \u2014 such their size and distance from one another, for example \u2014 and then compare these measurements to those from another photo, which is how they work.Predictably, masks that cover more of a person\u2019s face made it harder for the algorithms to work, researchers found. The more a person\u2019s nose was covered, the lower the accuracy of the technology was.The shape and color of a mask also were factors when it came to accuracy. Round masks produced lower error rates, while black masks gave the algorithms more difficulty in recognizing faces than blue ones, researchers said.False negative readings\u2014in which an algorithm fails to match two photos of the same person\u2013also increased when photo subjects wore masks, according to the study. False positives\u2014when an algorithm incorrectly indicates a match between photos of two different people\u2013were less affected, however, with results were generally the same as in unmasked scenarios or slightly declined.The fact that facial recognition is less accurate when people are masked might be good news for some, as the technology itself has been controversial and even shown evidence of wild inaccuracy in the best of cases.Facial recognition has come under heavy fire from privacy advocates, particularly in its use by law enforcement, which has resulted in alleged racial profiling and errors that misidentified politicians as criminals. These scenarios\u2014which involved Amazon\u2019s Recognition platform\u2013even inspired some Democratic lawmakers to propose a nationwide ban on the technology.Ngan was quick to say that the results of the NIST study are not meant to be conclusive, but merely guidelines for developing technology specifically designed to recognize faces while people are wearing masks\u201cWe can draw a few broad conclusions from the results, but there are caveats,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of these algorithms were designed to handle face masks, and the masks we used are digital creations, not the real thing.\u201dComplimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "LONDON \u2014 A recent attack aimed at a U.S.-based oil, gas and chemical supplier leverages the company\u2019s use of the enterprise-class Asterisk open-source PBX software, used for VoIP services.According to research from Check Point, presented here at Virus Bulletin 2019 on Friday, the attack was first identified early last year when researchers spotted scanning activity targeting 1,500 unique gateways tied to 600 companies. This reconnaissance activity stopped abruptly five months later, only to resume in February of this year, with one difference. This time the scans were targeted at a single U.S.-based engineering company that provides niche services to critical infrastructure utilities in the U.S.The adversary was able to use a command-injection technique over HTTP to inject a PHP web shell into the Asterisk server\u2019s outgoing directory, according to Check Point researcher Lotem Finkelstein. He added that the researchers weren\u2019t sure if the attacker leveraged a vulnerability to compromise the platform.\u201cWe see PHP web shells a lot,\u201d Finkelstein said from the stage at Virus Bulletin. \u201cIt\u2019s typically a somewhat amateurish approach \u2013 but here we saw it to be well-designed, and crafted and tailored for the Asterix server.\u201dAs a result, the adversary was able to gain complete control over the server, including being able to access databases (with private extensions and billing records), call recordings, metadata and detailed information on who called whom and when within the organization. Also, the attacker injected a call file that caused the Asterisk server to make external calls and play canned messages with the identity of the victimized company.The Attack\u2019s TopographyThe file that the adversary injected was a text file called \u201ccmd.txt\u201d \u2013 which contained an obfuscated PHP code. Once executed, the code looks for the existence of Asterisk configuration files and write a new administrative user into them, which gave the attacker full control over the server.\n\nAfter that, the PHP code hooked up with a command-and-control (C2) server, and downloaded a password-protected PHP web shell that carried out the data extraction, including the CALL file, which contains metadata on the calls made by the server.After that, the attacker inserted a new CALL file into the outgoing directory, offering the ability to make outgoing calls under the guise of the victimized company.The AttackerCheck Point was able to piece together some information about the attacker\u2019s identity. The PHP web shell was protected by a hardcoded password, also used in a similar PHP file.\u201cBut instead of the hard-coded string, the PHP had an embedded URL inside it, from which the password had to be extracted,\u201d according to the paper. From there, they were able to track the identity of the attacker to a person who, according to his LinkedIn profile, is a \u201csecurity enthusiast\u201d who lives in the Gaza Strip and works for the Palestinian Ministry of Telecommunications.However, it\u2019s unclear why the attack was undertaken. Despite the attack going on for months, no evidence of data stolen from the server has turned up anywhere on the underground, according to Check Point. Premium number fraud \u2013 in which highjacked phone numbers are used to make pay calls to premium services \u2013 could be one motivation, according to Finkelstein. Another could be hoaxing, prank calls or \u201cswatting\u201d (e.g, making false emergency calls to police). And yet another possibility is that the attacker was after the ability to make calls without being detected by intelligence organizations (although, as Finkelstein pointed out, using a VPN would be easier).\u201cWe don\u2019t have an answer as to motive,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe know he invested a lot of time in probing the servers and the nature of the specific server that he was able to exploit. He knows how many calls come in and out and to who. PBX information is one of an organization\u2019s crown jewels.\u201dThe attack should serve as a warning to others that use Asterisk (which has 2 million downloads per year), the researchers noted.\u201cThe infection vector is a customized PHP web shell, which is weaponized with new techniques targeting the Asterisk internal configuration files and databases \u2013 the same databases that hold all of the calls\u2019 metadata as well as the recordings of the calls,\u201d according to the paper. \u201cIf you own an Asterisk system in your network, you might ask yourself: \u2018Are my employees and I the only ones using it?'\u201dWhat are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "LONDON \u2014 Magecart, the digital card-skimming collective, is now so ubiquitous that its infrastructure is flooding the internet. In a paper presented at Virus Bulletin 2019 this week in London, Jordan Herman and Yonathan Klijnsma of RiskIQ said that there are now 573 known C2 domains for the group, with close to 10,000 hosts actively loading those domains.Magecart \u2013 which is an umbrella group encompassing several different affiliates all using the same modus operandi \u2013 injects malicious JavaScript that steals the data shoppers enter into online payment forms, typically on checkout pages. In all, RiskIQ has detected almost 2 million (2,086,529) instances of Magecart\u2019s javaScript binaries, with over 18,000 hosts directly breached.And, adding insult to injury, because Magecart skimmers stay on websites for so long, if not indefinitely, they can be a second-hand boon to threat actors, researchers said: Markets for skimmers and pre-breached websites are making the barriers to entry extremely low for new Magecart actors.\u201cLarge portions of malicious Magecart domains have been taken up for sinkholing by various parties,\u201d explained Herman and Klijnsma. \u201cHowever, some of them are kicked offline by the registrar, put on hold and eventually released back into a pool of available domains. RiskIQ researchers have noticed bad guys taking advantage of these domains coming back up for sale and buying them to continue skimming, or for other purposes, such as monetizing traffic through advertising or even serving malware.\u201dAccording to RiskIQ, Magecart has been active for nearly 10 years\u2014RiskIQ\u2019s earliest Magecart observation occurred on August 8, 2010. In that time, two different approaches have developed for attacking targets \u2014 gaining access to websites via a direct compromise, or via third-party services in supply-chain attacks.Magecart gets its name from primarily targeting the Magento third-party shopping software \u2013 it\u2019s a combination of \u201cMagento\u201d and \u201cshopping cart.\u201d The platform remains the lifeblood of many Magecart groups today: There are, according to RiskIQ, 9,688 vulnerable Magento hosts out there today.Supply-chain attacks, in which Magecart will typically target third parties that supply code to websites, are responsible for the largest spikes in RiskIQ Magecart detections, the firm noted. For instance, this was the approach taken in the well-publicized Ticketmaster attack that happened in July 2018. A Magecart group attacked website analytics providers SociaPlus and Inbenta in that instance, gaining access to over 800 e-commerce sites in the process and accessing an enormous victim pool.\u201cSuppliers can include vendors that integrate with sites to add or improve site functionality or cloud resources from which websites pull code, such as Amazon S3 buckets,\u201d according to the research. \u201cThese third parties integrate with thousands of websites, so when one supplier is compromised, Magecart has effectively breached thousands of sites at once.\u201dOn the S3 front, an active campaign first spotted in April 2019 has seen Magecart automate the process of compromising websites with skimmers by actively scanning for misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets. So far, the group has compromised a vast collection of S3 buckets to impact well over 17,000 domains, according to the RiskIQ report.In all, it\u2019s a good reminder to web administrators to review the code on their sites for suspicious artifacts and unauthorized changes.\u201cMagecart takes advantage of online businesses\u2019 general lack visibility into their web-facing attack surfaces,\u201d according to the report. \u201cIn many cases, the victims have no idea the JavaScript on their site has been changed, allowing the malicious code to exist there indefinitely. In the case of supply-chain attacks, it\u2019s common a victim does not know that the compromised third-party JavaScript on their site is dangerous \u2014 or that they\u2019re even running the code from the breached supplier.\u201dWhat are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "LONDON \u2014 Three separate, multi-year APT campaigns targeting region-specific software showcase a savvy technique of leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities in niche software in order to infect victims with malware.According to researchers at JPCERT in Japan, speaking at Virus Bulletin 2019, both the APT17 and Bronze Butler threat groups have carried out ongoing campaigns that use the same techniques, swapping out exploits as new exploits are developed. The targets of the attacks are generally Japanese government agencies and vertical organizations, including education organizations, researchers said, with the most recent malicious activity seen in April 2019.According to JPCERT researchers Tomoaki Tani and Shusei Tomonaga, the regional software targeted by the APTs includes Sanshiro (a spreadsheet application similar to Microsoft Excel, which was discontinued in 2014 but still used across Japan); Ichitaro (a word processing, software similar to Microsoft Word); and SkySea Client View (an enterprise asset-management tool).When it comes to Sanshiro, major campaigns from APT17 leveraged a zero-day exploit for an arbitrary code execution vulnerability (CVE-2014-0810), spread in malicious documents attached to spearphishing emails. It began its routine when the user opened the software; and the endgame was the delivery of the PlugX remote access trojan (RAT).\u201cThis exploit was shared in several campaigns, and perhaps the actor was the same in all of them,\u201d said Tani, speaking in a Wednesday session at Virus Bulletin 2019. \u201cFurther analysis showed that PlugX was used in other attacks, with each sample resolving to the same command-and-control server address.\u201dA similar effort targeted Ichitaro, which was used in a multi-year campaign starting in 2014 dubbed Blue Termite. It affected more than 100 organizations across Japan; here, another zero-day code-execution exploit (CVE-2014-7247) was used in spearphishing campaigns to spread a triumvirate of malware: PlugX and two bots, Emdivi and Agtid. The bots can upload and download files from the victim\u2019s computer.JPCERT also observed attacks likely carried out by an APT called Bronze Butler, making use of the SkySea Client View software, which is an asset-management software. It contains a vulnerability (CVE-2016-7836) that was exploited as a zero-day campaign in 2016 \u2013 and it was seen continuing through February 2019. It was used to execute the NodeRAT multiplatform backdoor malware, which is written in JavaScript and runs on Node.js; and the Wali downloader application.This attack is linked, researchers suspect, to an April 2019 effort targeting a vulnerability in the Virus Buster Corporate Edition from Trend Micro, which is popular in Japan.In all cases, the campaigns were aimed at infiltrating target networks, moving laterally and stealing data, in classic APT fashion.The takeaway from the research is that APT groups are actively targeting niche attack surfaces in hopes of flying under the radar of defenders. While these particular attacks occurred in Japan, the same approach would prove effective elsewhere, according to Tani.\u201cTargeted attacks against Japanese organizations exploited three different vulnerabilities in software that\u2019s used only in Japan,\u201d Tani concluded. \u201cNonetheless, these APT groups investigated this software and leveraged them for attacks. Unlike more popular software, it is often the case that countermeasures against vulnerabilities in such regional attacks are not well-prepared. Attackers understand this and aim for such weak points.\u201dWhat are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "LONDON \u2014 A powerful Android botnet dubbed Geost has been spotted targeting Russian citizens, with the end goal of distributing a banking trojan to victims.The botnet has infected more than 800,000 Android devices, controlling several million Euros held in five banks, according to researchers from Czech Technical University, UNCUYO University and Avast that discovered the botnet.Researchers noted that the botnet would likely still be undiscovered if it weren\u2019t for a series of lapses in the cybercriminals\u2019 operational security (OpSec) \u2013 including using unencrypted chat logs found as part of the investigation, and the use of a leaky proxy network that fails in its mission to provide anonymization.\u201cA rare chain of OpSec mistakes lead to the discovery of a new Android banking botnet,\u201d according to the research, presented at Virus Bulletin 2019 in London on Wednesday. \u201cThe unusual discovery was made when the botmasters decided to trust a malicious proxy network built by a malware called HtBot. The HtBot malware provides a proxy service that can be rented to give users a pseudo-anonymous communication to the internet. The analysis of the HtBot network communication led to the discovery and disclosure of a large malicious operation.\u201dHtBot operates by turning victims into unwilling private illegal internet proxies. The infected victims relay communications from the HtBot users to the internet; and, the traffic is continually redirected to new victims, making it hard to track.However, \u201csince these bots offered illegal proxy connections it was possible to capture all the traffic coming from the illegal users to the internet,\u201d according to the research. \u201cDuring the analysis of the network traffic of the illegal users, a pattern was discovered; this turned out to be the content of the command-and-control (C2) communication channel of the new Geost botnet.\u201dAdding insult to injury, Geost\u2019s botmasters also failed to encrypt their communications, giving researchers a direct view into the adversaries\u2019 internal workings. This includes technical details such as how they accessed servers, brought new devices into the botnet, and how they evade antivirus software; as well as clues about how the members of the group interact with each other.\u201cIn one conversation, a member of the ring wants to leave the group but the leader encouraged him to stay, saying, \u2018Alexander, really, if we started together we need to finish it. Because for now this is working and we can earn money. Not every day we are getting 100K for promotion,'\u201d according to the team\u2019s report.Other conversations revolved around money laundering and infiltrating victims\u2019 bank accounts; it turns out that lower-level operatives are responsible for bringing devices into the botnet, while higher-level operatives determine how much money was under their control.Propagation and ReachThe Geost botnet consists of infected Android phones, which are victimized by the botnet via malicious, fake applications. These include fake banking apps and fake social networks. Once infected the phones connect to the botnet and are remotely controlled.\u201cThe usual actions of the attackers seem to be accessing the SMS, sending SMS, communicating with banks, and redirect the traffic of the phone to different sites,\u201d explained the team. \u201cThe botmasters also access a great deal of personal information from the user.\u201dFollowing the infection, the C2 stores the complete list of SMS messages of all the victims starting with the moment the device becomes infected.In terms of its infrastructure, Geost is quite complex. \u201cThe Geost botnet proved to have hundreds of malicious domains generated by a DGA algorithm, at least 13 C2 IP addresses in six countries, at least 800,000 victims in Russia, and access to several million Euros in the bank accounts of the victims,\u201d the team noted in its paper. \u201cWe could see the screens of the C2 servers, lists of victims and SMSs of the victims. The botnet could directly connect to the top five banks in Russia to operate, and deployed more than 200 Android APKs to fake dozens of applications.\u201dThe research team has contacted the five affected Russian banks and are working with them to shut down the campaign.One is one of the top five providers of credit cards in Russia. The second bank is one of the largest private commercial banks in that country. The third is one of the three largest banks in Russia and Eastern Europe and the fourth bank is one of the 500 largest organizations in Europe. A fifth is part of a large group of cooperatives with subsidiaries in more than 15 countries.\u201cThe fact that only five banks were listed suggests that there is a special type of action that can only happen with those banks,\u201d according to the research. \u201cIt may seem as if the malware APKs or the C&C code could access and make transfers in accounts of those banks, but this hypothesis was not proven.\u201dWhat are the top cyber security issues associated with privileged account access and credential governance?

        "raw text": "Researchers have spotted a variant of the Dridex banking trojan with new obfuscation capabilities that help it skirt anti-virus detection.While Dridex has been around since 2011, researchers told Threatpost Friday that they recently spotted phishing emails distributing a never-before-seen variant of the malware. This variant uses file signatures that are difficult for anti-virus software to sniff out \u2013 allowing the malware to evade detection when on infected systems.JR DePre, red team technical manager with eSentire, told Threatpost that the new vartiant is another step in the \u201cconstant game of cat-and-mouse\u201d being played between defenders and attackers behind the Dridex malware: \u00a0\u201cAs detection for new techniques continues to evolve, the malicious actors will continue to update their tools to bypass those detections.\u201d\u201cDue to the popularity of Dridex within modern attacks, it\u2019s safe to assume that the developers of the malware will continue to advance their techniques,\u201d said DePre.Dridex first appeared in the wild in 2011 \u2013 but in the almost decade since, the malware has undergone a series of transformations. Researchers said in a Thursday analysis that like infamous banking trojan Emotet, \u201ceach new version of Dridex traces a further step in the global arms race as the security community responds with new detection and mitigations.\u201dMost recently, researchers spotted the malware being delivered to victims via an email in the form of a malicious document with embedded macros.\u00a0 Once downloaded, Dridex then targets banking information.\u201cDepending on the environment, the macros can be triggered by varying levels of employee interaction,\u201d said researchers.\u00a0 \u201cThe message in the email appears\u2026 with specific numbers redacted (as they could potentially be used by a threat actor to track campaign victim metrics).\u201dThe new variant in this phishing email came with several key changes: The biggest of which are tactics aimed at avoiding anti-viral detection.Anti-virus software mainly rely on file signatures (MD5 or SHA256 hashes) to detect malicious applications, DePre explained.\u00a0Dridex utilizes newly created and signed 64-bit dynamic link libraries (DLLs), which have different file signatures from previous versions that have been detected by anti-virus software in the past.\u201cThese DLLs are side loaded via legitimate MS Windows binaries, making them appear to be part of a legitimate software product, and thus more difficult to detect,\u201d DePre told Threaptost.The new feature is proving effective: So far, only 19 anti-virus products (of about 60) have identified the trojan\u2019s behavior. A full list of the anti-virus engines that successfully detected the trojan \u2013 and those that haven\u2019t \u2013 can be found on VirusTotal.In another novel change, the malware also utilizes an Application Whitelisting technique to bypass mitigation techniques, showing another attempt by the the malware authors to trip up defense tactics.This tactic takes advantage of a weakness in the WMI command-line (WMIC), a\u00a0software utility that enables users to carry out Windows Management Instrumentation\u00a0operations with a command prompt. Windows Management Instrumentation\u00a0is the infrastructure for management data and operations on Windows-based operating systems.Specifically, the malware targets a weak execution policy in the\u00a0WMIC\u2019s application whitelisting process around XLS scripts.\u00a0Application whitelisting is the process of specifying approved applications that are permitted to be executed within a computer environment; many companies utilize this technique to protect themselves from harmful applications.The weakness means that XLS scripts containing \u00a0malicious Visual Basic Script (VBS) can be loaded:\u00a0\u201cEssentially, if a company has Windows Script host disabled or blocked, this variant can bypass that whitelisting technique and still execute malicious code via WMIC using a XLS file with malicious VBS in it,\u201d said DePre.Researchers told Threatpost that they don\u2019t have any further information at this time about the threat actor behind Dridex but \u201care continuing investigations.\u201dMalwareWeb Security",

While this fits into pattern of ongoing attacks on \u201ccivil society\u201d members (i.e., journalists, social justice activists, dissidents and human rights organizations), the larger pool of threats against this group comes from what Citizen Lab terms \u201cforever-days\u201d \u2013 run-of-the-mill malware and old exploits that have been hanging around for years.In the latest campaign, Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist and Montreal resident, was targeted and infected with NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware, according to Citizen Lab. The targeting occurred while Abdulaziz, who recently received asylum in Canada, was attending McGill University.Citizen Lab\u2019s Masashi Nishihata explained in a session at Virus Bulletin 2018 in Montreal this week that while performing a global mapping of NSO\u2019s Pegasus infrastructure, the group identified a suspected Pegasus infection located in Quebec. It was carried out by what researchers \u201cinferred to be a Saudi Arabia-based attacker,\u201d he added.Upon further analysis, the infection was seen using two different networks for internet connectivity: The risq academic network, which is specific to the French-Canadian province of Quebec, and Videotron, which is a large telecom provider in the region. Given that Abdulaziz is a student, Citizen Lab was able to match the infection\u2019s communications pattern to his movements using time stamps and other information that the victim provided.The attack was highly targeted and relied on a knowledge of Abdulaziz as a person. \u201cIt turns out that Omar ordered a large tub of whey protein,\u201d Nishihata said. \u201cShortly thereafter, he received a text message with \u2018shipping information.\u2019 It seemed relevant, and there was no reason to distrust it. It wasn\u2019t a confirmation though; it was the Pegasus spyware.\u201dThe message in fact contained a link to a known Pegasus exploit domain.\u201cWe examined the attack chain and they used a string of three different exploits to carry this out,\u201d Nishihata noted.That Abdulaziz was targeted isn\u2019t surprising, Citizen Lab said in a breakdown of the attack, posted this week: \u201cAbdulaziz has been outspoken on an ongoing diplomatic feud over human rights issues between Canada and Saudi Arabia,\u201d researchers explained.The problems started this summer when Canadian citizens who are also Saudi dissidents were arrested in Saudi Arabia in August, prompting concerns on the part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s government. In the resulting escalation of tensions, Saudi Arabia has expelled the Canadian ambassador, is attempting to pull thousands of students and medical patients from Canada and has suspended Saudi state airline flights to Toronto.Abdulaziz has been gaining some amount of notoriety for his activism, starting even before the feud. He regularly appears in Canadian media, and \u201cOmar had amassed a significant following on YouTube,\u201d said Citizen Lab\u2019s John Scott Railton, speaking at Virus Bulletin 2018 in Montreal this week. \u201cAnd he has been under pressure from the Saudi government to tone it down.\u201dMost recently, Abdulaziz, on a recent guest appearance on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)\u2019s current affairs show, The Current, on August 10, said that Saudi authorities had entered his brother\u2019s home in Saudi Arabia and \u201casked him to convince me [to] stop tweeting about what\u2019s really going on between Canada and Saudi Arabia, or they\u2019re going to send him to jail.\u201dHigh-End Spyware PersistsCitizen Lab said that the situation is just the latest example of the misuse of commercial spyware \u2013 which it defines as products ostensibly made by legitimate companies for use by supposedly vetted governmental organizations to catch terrorists and criminals.\u201cIn six years, we have observed four spyware companies (FinFisher, Hacking Team, Cyberbit and NSO Group) make similar claims: their products are used for catching terrorists and criminals; they undertake due diligence before selling their products to a customer; and they investigate allegations of misuse, taking remedial actions if warranted,\u201d researchers noted in the posting. \u201c[Yet] findings by Citizen Lab show that many governments and their intelligence services cannot resist abusing spyware\u2026 each company\u2019s products have been abused in ways that caused measurable harm to human rights defenders, journalists, lawyers working on behalf of victims of crimes, or civic media (e.g. bloggers).\u201dIsrael-based vendor NSO Group produces and sells the Pegasus mobile phone spyware suite; it contains a range of features that can be used to infect the user\u2019s smartphone, track keystrokes, take control of the phone\u2019s camera and microphone, and access contact lists.It\u2019s been on the international market for a while, and continues to morph: In 2016, Citizen Lab and Lookout found that Pegasus was being used to take control of Apple devices using three zero-day iOS vulnerabilities, collectively called Trident. This function (now patched) was then used to target the Emirati award-winning human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, the firms found, who has been in prison in the United Arab Emirates since March 2017. In addition, former president Ricardo Martinelli stands accused by the government of Panama of having used Pegasus during his tenure between 2009 and 2014 to systematically spy on political opponents and journalists. More recently, Amnesty International was targeted by Pegasus; as were several Mexican dissidents. Recent research shows that use of the malware has spread to 45 different countries.Less Flashy ProblemsThe civil-society set has seen an epidemic of digital threats as they rush to use internet platforms and social media to carry out their work. Some of these threats are sophisticated, and include zero-day exploits, custom kits and government-exclusive spyware like Pegasus, sold for millions of dollars.However, Nishihata and fellow Citizen Lab researcher John Scott Railton contended at Virus Bulletin 2018 that the majority of these threats don\u2019t advance far beyond the minimum necessary technical sophistication to get the job done.\u201cPhishing and commodity off the shelf (COTS) malware, in other words, are the norm,\u201d Railton explained in a session on \u201cforever-days.\u201d \u201cThese basic threats are successful, because they exploit human behavior, and are the original vulnerability.\u201dRegardless of the level of sophistication, these threats can lead to very real harm to individuals, organizations and social movements.\u201cThe security community has a tendency to focus on the newest, most sophisticated and exotic threats,\u201d the researcher said. \u201cPhishing and remote access trojans (RATs) are \u2018boring\u2019. Yet boring threats can do far more harm, on a much larger scale.\u201dTo put it in perspective, the researchers framed it in terms of public health models: Some of the biggest killers in the world are not exotic, high-profile diseases like Ebola, but are actually much more common and mundane illnesses, like malaria and intestinal ailments.The rate of attack for this segment is comparable to other attacked segments, hovering around 20-ish percent of the focus for groups like APT 28, according to Nishihata and Railton. \u201cHowever, these are much, much softer targets,\u201d Railton said \u2013 adding that between 40 percent and 60 percent of civil-society workers in testing are tricked by spear-phishing emails.Nishihata added, \u201cthere\u2019s an inherent asymmetry in information security: It\u2019s cheap to connect, but expensive to secure. In practical terms, for NGO groups, you\u2019re running your ultimate BYOD environment, and they have very limited staff with a mix of technical skills and poor documentation of the systems they\u2019re using. There\u2019s likely no real IT staff.\u201dGoing back to the context of public health, \u201cpreventable and curable issues can become catastrophic without infrastructure to prevent it,\u201d Nishihata said. \u201cZero-days are the Ebola; RATs and \u2018old-day\u2019 exploits are old, crusty and boring \u2013 and preventable; they\u2019re the tuberculosis of security. But they\u2019re delivering, and honestly, if you\u2019re a threat actor, why would you burn a zero-day if you don\u2019t need to?\u201dThat said, despite many of the threat groups having what Railton calls a bottom-of-the-barrel, \u201cmy cousin knows computers\u201d level of sophistication, one thing they\u2019ve gotten very good at is making lures believable for phishing emails.For example, in one campaign using a \u201ccheck out this news\u201d type of lure, if a target clicked on a link in an email, he or she would be redirected to a phishing page for Dropbox or Google Drive that pre-populated the victim\u2019s name and looked identical to the real log-in page.\u201cOnce you put in your credentials, you\u2019re redirected to benign content \u2013 the original content that was promised, so you wouldn\u2019t know you\u2019ve been attacked,\u201d explained Nishihata. \u201cIn all, the campaign used 58 decoy documents and 11 targeting themes and was active for 19 months and it was very, very successful. We estimated the total cost of the attack to be little over $1000.\u201dBetween having a target population that\u2019s more susceptible than most, and the fact that these types of threats present a minimal barrier of entry and require a low level of technical sophistication, these attacks are becoming more and more common.\u201cIt levels the playing field for digital espionage so everyone can do it, and believe me, everyone is,\u201d Nishihata said.GovernmentMalwareMobile SecurityPrivacy",

        "raw text": "MONTREAL \u2014 While troll farms, influence campaigns and Twitter bots that spread disinformation have all become high-profile and negative aspects of the social-media universe, new research shows that there is actually a rich and complex supply chain behind these efforts.\u201cSocial-media fraud is widespread and we know this \u2013 what we didn\u2019t know was just how many players are actually involved in it,\u201d explained Masarah Paquet-Clouston, a researcher with GoSecure, speaking at Virus Bulletin 2018 here on Thursday.Customer-facing websites that claim to be legitimate businesses, such as Devumi, market the ability to \u201cquickly gain followers, viewers, likes and more\u201d through vaguely defined \u201cmarketing tactics.\u201d But behind the scenes, the researcher said, lies a complex chain of traffic resellers, platform providers and bot traffic \u2013 an apparatus that fuels the business of inflating social-media traffic as well as more nefarious activities such as influence campaigns.Bot TrafficThe string that unraveled the sweater on this ecosystem started with the Linux/Moose botnet, first spotted in 2015.Linux/Moose is an IoT botnet, which, as its name suggests, infects devices that have embedded Linux systems. Like Mirai and other IoT botnets, it displays a wormlike behavior, spreading by brute-forcing Telnet credentials. But instead of its traffic being marshalled to drive denial-of-service campaigns, it uses enslaved devices as proxies to relay traffic to social media sites. It steals HTTP cookies on social media sites and performs a type of click-fraud that is used to accumulate illegitimate views, create fake followers and generate Likes. About 86 percent of its traffic flows to Instagram, GoSecure found.Looking further into Linux/Moose\u2019s infrastructure, Paquet-Clouston found that the botnet\u2019s architecture includes a whitelist of seven IP addresses that can push traffic through those proxies. After analyzing the traffic fingerprints left by each IP address on Linux/Moose-infected systems, the researcher eventually determined that these IP addresses are Windows servers with proxy-aware Instagram clients, used to manage fake social-media accounts that perform the faux Likes and follows.In a savvy move, each IP address is tied to a specific group of fake accounts with no overlap between them \u2013 which is a usage pattern that is more credible when it comes to Instagram\u2019s algorithm for rooting out fraud than bouncing between IP addresses.After decrypting and analyzing the traffic for these IPs, Paquet-Clouston found similarities between all seven in terms of their TLS fingerprints, geography, websites targeted, user-agents and so on \u2013 leading her to conclude that they\u2019re all controlled by the same actor.Bulk Traffic Resellers and Software PanelsIt was during the whitelist analysis that Paquet-Clouston uncovered evidence of bulk reseller panels that sell traffic to the aforementioned customer-facing websites (which as mentioned, in turn sell followers, traffic and likes to end users as legitimate businesses).\u201cYou would see an Instagram or Twitter account advertising bulk traffic resellers, where people can buy wholesale followers and likes,\u201d she explained, adding that they all had similar login pages, with different customized branding and pictures. \u201cWhen we visited these reseller sites \u2013 343 panels found in all \u2013 they all seemed really similar, so I began wondering if the same actor was behind all of them.\u201dHowever, the rabbit hole went still deeper. Further exploration yielded thousands of these type reseller sites, all similar in form.\u201cCould it really be the same actor behind all of these panels?\u201d Paquet-Clouston said. \u201cSurely not \u2013 five or 10 maybe, but thousands is a lot.\u201dAfter some analysis of the specific traits in the reseller sites, she found that certain clusters of them seemed related and built on the same platform. For instance, out of 486 reseller panel websites spotted in action on July 17, 99 percent of them were using the same reCAPTCHA SiteKey. This raised the possibility that there was another player in the supply chain: A platform provider, a.k.a. a software panel seller, that enables people to easily these kinds of build bulk resale sites.\u201cThe reCAPTCHA link tying all those sites together tells us that they are all tied to one software panel seller,\u201d she noted.This hypothesis was confirmed by digging deeper \u2013 the researcher uncovered an ad for a software panel that offered an \u201call-in-one solution for reselling or providing social media management services,\u201d including web hosting and panel maintenance. As such, these software panels seller makes it very easy to get started in the social-media fraud business, Paquet-Clouston added.\u201cEven with no technical skills, a person can enter this market no problem,\u201d the researcher explained. \u201cThe platform is an all-in-one service \u2013 all you need is a domain name, and they do everything else.\u201dCost to use the software panel ranges from $50 to $100 per month.In all, GoSecure found 1,500 bulk traffic reseller sites, enabled by just five software-panel sellers.Connection to Botnets?The next step was figuring out how these reseller panels connect to Linux/Moose or other IoT botnets to capture their traffic. It is likely that most of the traffic that ends up being sold by customer-facing websites is generated by bots.However, Paquet-Clouston said more investigation is needed. The software platforms used by the bulk traffic resellers contain APIs for onboarding traffic from external sources \u2013 these sources could be a troll farm, the reseller\u2019s own botnet, another reseller or a botnet that\u2019s already generating large amounts of social-media traffic, like Linux/Moose.She ran into a snag, however. The Linux/Moose botnet doesn\u2019t allow for API connections to its whitelisted IP addresses \u2014 they only accept remote desktop protocol (RDP) connections. That left the researcher wondering how the botnet could be connected to these reseller panels.Paquet-Clouston came up with two hypotheses: \u201cOne, the whitelisted IP addresses\u2019 fat client fetches orders by itself; or, an RDP tunnel is created between the reseller and the whitelisted IP address servers,\u201d she explained. The first case hinges on the a sophisticated proxy-aware Instagram fat-client that the botnet uses to manage fake accounts and the flows of interaction with Instagram. Because it has rich functionality, it\u2019s possible that this is brokering the traffic exchange as a separate process. Otherwise, a manual RDP connection could be made between reseller and botnet.As it stands, \u201cwe still have not [definitively] found out how resellers\u2026are linked to Linux/Moose\u2019s whitelisted IP addresses,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know they are related, since some social-media fraud reseller panels were found in the Instagram accounts followed by Linux/Moose\u2019s traffic.\u201dThe Full Supply Chain Even with outstanding questions, taken together, a picture emerges of the full supply chain. Put simply, customer-facing marketers like Devumi (along with more shadowy players involved in trolling and other forms of social-media fraud) buy traffic from bulk traffic resellers, which are enabled by a software-panel reseller. These bulk traffic resellers in turn very likely connect to whitelisted IP addresses associated with Linux/Moose or a similar botnet in order to take in their traffic.While certain details still need to be cleared up, it\u2019s certain that this is a sprawling enterprise involving hundreds of players. The upshot though is that it\u2019s not nearly as profitable for everyone concerned as researchers expected it to be. GoSecure research found that traffic resellers with customer-facing websites charge a median price of $13 for 1,000 \u201cfollowers\u201d on Instagram. A reseller panel meanwhile makes just $1 from those 1,000 fake followers.\u201cWe really thought this would be making a lot of money,\u201d Paquet-Clouston said. \u201cBut it turns out that even owners of reseller panels have a hard time being profitable. The actors are just not making as much as if they set up a legal business, and they have the added hassle of having to hide behind all of these other people.\u201dFor the organizations, minor celebrities and ordinary people that buy this kind of traffic, the story doesn\u2019t have much of a happy ending either. The research shows that about 80 percent of faux followers are gone within four months, because they get flagged as spam or fakes \u2013 meaning that people are in a constant scramble to maintain their artificially inflated social-media presence.However, the one big winner is the customer-facing traffic seller group. GoSecure found that someone looking to beef up their social-media presence would pay around $112 for 10,000 follows. The Demuvis of the world in turn keep about 92 percent of that revenue.\u201cFurther research is required to better understand the dynamics that link each actor in the supply chain,\u201d Paquet-Clouston said. \u201cStill, this research is part of a two-year-long investigation that attempts to place a botnet\u2019s operation into its economic context.\u201d\u00a0Uncategorized",

        "raw text": "MONTREAL \u2013 The Turla APT group\u2019s extensive activities have diversified this year, representing a mix of old code, new code and fresh targets. Perhaps most interesting, this sophisticated group is branching into using scripts and open-source code in its malware development \u2013 a marked departure for an APT best-known for deploying a complex rootkit called Snake, traditionally focused on NATO-related targets.Russian-speaking Turla (a.k.a. Snake, Venomous Bear, Waterbug and Uroboros) is known for spy campaigns targeting Western governments as well as embassies and consulates in post-Soviet states. It\u2019s been active since at least 2014 (and possibly earlier) developing a range of custom backdoors to carry out its work. It continually evolves both in terms of malware and targets.\u201cTurla is highly capable, well-resourced and they go back for years,\u201d explained Kurt Baumgartner, a researcher with Kaspersky Lab\u2019s threat research team, speaking at Virus Bulletin 2018 in Montreal on Thursday. \u201cTurla is so large, and they have many, many different things going on at once. And if you look at other research, it\u2019s also clearly bigger than just our visibility into it.\u201dNotable developments for the group observed by Kaspersky Lab researchers in 2018 include new versions of Carbon, which is a malware that goes back to 2014; a modified version of its Mosquito malware; and a continued evolution of its IcedCoffee and KopiLuwak binaries.As for Carbon, Baumgartner said that in 2018 it received a new orchestrator and other updates, and that it has been reliably deployed against government and foreign affairs related organizations in Central Asia all year \u2013 an attack pattern that he expects to continue into next year.\u201cThe Carbon framework [ties] together the older, elegant and functional codebase sometimes called \u2018Snake lite\u2019 with ongoing efforts to selectively monitor high-value targets,\u201d Kaspersky Lab researchers said in a posting on their latest Turla research, released on Thursday in tandem with the Virus Bulletin talk. \u201cIt appears that the backdoor is pushed with meterpreter now. And, as we see code modifications and deployment in 2018, we predict more development work on this matured codebase along with selective deployment to continue into 2019.\u201dKaspersky Lab\u2019s Kurt BaumgartnerThe team also has seen a modified version of Mosquito buzzing around in recent months \u2013 now with open-source tooling being bundled into it from the Metasploit project. Turla is using Mosquito to take aim at foreign-affairs-related government targets in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia, according to the research.\u201cMosquito is focused on diplomatic and governmental organizations, and it\u2019s very consistent about that profiling,\u201d said Baumgartner. \u201cIt\u2019s less restrictive in its geography.\u201dHe added that another interesting aspect of Mosquito is its delivery by man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks, which were seen last year: \u201cThe installers that we have seen that support the hypothesis that in all likelihood, there are WiFi based MiTM techniques are going on.\u201dKaspersky Lab\u2019s telemetry shows that download sessions with Adobe\u2019s website were intercepted and injected to deliver Mosquito trojanized installers, which demonstrated consistent WiFi credential theft.\u201cMeanwhile, injection and delivery techniques are undergoing changes in 2018 with reflective loaders and code enhancements,\u201d according to the research. \u201cWe expect to see more Mosquito activity into 2019.\u201dIn 2018, both Turla\u2019s Mosquito and Carbon projects focused mainly on diplomatic and foreign affairs targets, although the APT also targeted scientific and technical centers, and organizations outside of the political arena came under focus as well.Meanwhile, a pair of related Javascript backdoors \u2013 IcedCoffee (which simply downloads other malware and is not very feature rich) and KopiLuwak (a more robust agent) \u2013 have also gained prevalence on the Turla scene.KopiLuwak was seen earlier this summer taking aim at two targets: One in the scientific and energy field, and one related to the governments in Syria and Afghanistan, showing that Turla\u2019s KopiLuwak activity does not necessarily focus on diplomatic/foreign affairs. \u201cInstead, 2018 activity targeted government related scientific and energy research organizations, and a government related communications organization in Afghanistan,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cThis highly selective but wider targeting set most likely will continue into 2019.\u201dKaspersky Lab researcher Mike Scott also flagged a KopiLuwak/Zebrocy code overlap. Zebrocy is a malware used by a different threat group, observed this summer.\u201cThe third layer in the code is exactly the same between the two,\u201d he said, speaking at Virus Bulletin. \u201cThat indicates that the same tool or generator is building these. I couldn\u2019t find any other samples that match these, so they\u2019re tied. Whether one group saw the code and took it, or if they\u2019re collaborating, maybe talking about it over beers or whatnot, who knows.\u201dKaspersky Lab\u2019s Mike ScottTaking the findings together, the researchers believe the Turla group is taking on a new overall shape \u2013 especially as regards the use of ready-made code.\u201cThere is a decided shift by Turla towards increased use of open-source tools in their malware,\u201d said Baumgartner. \u201cThis is a surprise from Turla. They used an incredibly complex root kit for years, to attack high-profile, interesting targets, and now they\u2019re moving to scripts and open source. They haven\u2019t been using a lot of zero-days either \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s been none in 2018. We\u2019ve seen no rootkits and no waterholing. So, something is changing and shifting with this group.\u201dInterestingly, Turla has not been a part of the Russian hacking efforts commonly attributed to APT 28/Sofacy, nor is it part of a number of other well-known activities linked to Russian-speaking groups.Instead, \u201cTurla [is] quietly active around the globe on other projects,\u201d according to the research. \u201cIt is interesting that data related to these organizations [such as the DNC] has not been weaponized and found online, while this Turla activity quietly carries on.\u201dBackground Turla ResearchBy way of background, in recent months Turla was also seen trotting out a fresh backdoor. A campaign using the new malware took aim at Germany\u2019s Federal Foreign Office during 2017 (which the group breached after compromising the network of the country\u2019s Federal College of Public Administration); and, Turla set its sights on the foreign offices of two European countries and a major defense contractor this year, according to IBM research from August. The 2018 efforts included new variants of the backdoor.\u201cThe most recent versions of Turla\u2019s invention went after targets\u2019 inboxes by subverting Microsoft Office\u2019s Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI),\u201d IBM noted in a Tuesday posting analyzing the campaign. \u201cThey were fully controllable by email and didn\u2019t rely on a conventional command-and-control (C&C) server. Instead, the backdoors used specially crafted PDF files in email attachments to fulfill a series of commands such as data exfiltration. The most recent variant from April 2018 was also capable of executing PowerShell commands by leveraging Empire PSInject.\u201dTaken together, the backdoor\u2019s features make it hard to spot and better able to target additional marks, IBM said.Turla\u2019s knack for reinventing its tools and tactics is not a recent development: It was also earlier this year seen using new technique for getting code on victim machines. Researchers at ESET observed the group evolving from its previous tactic of using fake Adobe Flash Player installers to lure victims into executing malware: More recently, it has bundled a backdoor together with a legitimate Flash Player installer. And, making attacks even sneakier and harder to spot, the URLs and the IP addresses it uses appear to correspond to Adobe\u2019s legitimate infrastructure.\u201cIn so doing, the attackers essentially misuse the Adobe brand to trick users into downloading malware,\u201d ESET researchers explained in a post from January on the tactic. While victims believe they\u2019re downloading authentic software from adobe.com, the reality is that the installer tampers with the operating system\u2019s registry to establish persistence on the system, then creates an administrative account that allows remote access.Before that, in 2017, Turla\u2019s Gazer backdoor was uncovered [PDF], which makes an extra effort to evade detection by changing strings within its code, randomizing markers and wiping files securely. It also employs custom encryption.APTs in general are swift to innovate, given their profiles and goals: State-sponsored cyber-espionage for political or corporate information; complex cyber-heists on behalf of organized crime or nation-states; or efforts at spreading disinformation and wielding influence campaigns. They tend to rely on proprietary malware and are focused on making attribution difficult; they also don\u2019t like to be detected since persistence is usually the name of the game. All of that requires staying one or more steps ahead of the defenders and security researchers \u2013 and Turla is no exception in its quest to do so.\u201cTurla is showing no signs of slowing down its efforts to spy on promising targets and secretly infect networks with malware for as long as possible,\u201d IBM noted.\u00a0GovernmentMalware",

        "raw text": "MONTREAL \u2013 As businesses increasingly turn to the cloud and to software-as-a-service applications, they are finding themselves with new attack surfaces and new types of threats \u2013 specifically, hard-to-thwart supply-chain attacks that have the potential for large amounts of collateral damage. In a keynote presentation at Virus Bulletin 2018 in Montreal on Wednesday, John Lambert, distinguished engineer at the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, laid out what the new normal looks like.Put simply, the move to the cloud doesn\u2019t mean that old adversaries focused on compromising the network perimeter simply go away. They just change up their tactics. Software supply-chain attacks in particular are on the rise, he added.\u201cAdversaries study our networks and our technology and our businesses, and it\u2019s important that we study back,\u201d Lambert explained. \u201cIf you\u2019re a customer and you\u2019re choosing a cloud or a SaaS service, expect your attackers to follow you. They\u2019ll infiltrate by changing up their techniques to attack you and get at the same data they were trying to get to when they were attacking you on-prem.\u201dSupply-Chain Attacks SurgeThe most notable emerging tactic is the targeting of the application-development supply chain, which Lambert said is becoming \u201cpervasive across segments.\u201dFor example, he said that Microsoft is seeing more and more malicious JavaScript packages (which are modules that developers use to build web and cloud applications). These are actually backdoor modules masquerading as legitimate pieces of code.A famous case involving this came to light last year when npm Inc. (a JavaScript package repository) removed 38 JavaScript packages that had infected projects with malicious code. A hacker had simply uploaded them to the npm repository, using typo-squatting to dupe developers into using the modules.Typo-squatting is a technique where a piece of software or a URL is given a name that\u2019s almost identical to a legitimate property. In the npm example, one of the malicious packages was named \u201cmongose\u201d \u2013 and it contained source code for the legitimate Mongoose project along with extra malicious code.Similarly, Lambert brought up the increasing use of Python. Last year, 10 malicious libraries, with similar names to legitimate code modules, were found on the Python Package Index, often abbreviated as PyPI. These packages contained the exact same code as the upstream libraries, except for an installation script with malicious properties.Microsoft itself was even compromised this way, Lambert added. Its PowerShell Gallery feature allows developers to create and upload various scripts. After Spectre and Meltdown were discovered, Microsoft published a script to help people understand if they were vulnerable to the two issued; it was dubbed \u201cSpeculation Control.\u201dThe malicious code was hidden in the white space.\u201cSomeone uploaded \u2018Speculations Control, plural, which mimicked all of the functions and was almost identical to the real code,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cBut it contained a backdoor and a decoder.\u201dThe attackers were savvy in this case\u2014the only sign that things were amiss was the code for the decoder; the backdoor itself cleverly made use of a white space to hide.The bad news is that thanks to how close the names are to the real thing, developers may have been none-the-wiser when building applications with the malicious packages \u2013 thus unknowingly turning out malware-laced applications that could be adopted by thousands of users. For instance, in the Python case, the libraries were subsequently incorporated into software \u201cmultiple times,\u201d according to Slovakia\u2019s National Security Authority.\u201cAttackers are preying upon developers, and counting on them not picking up on the typos,\u201d said Lambert. \u201cThis has the potential to create very broad attacks where the malicious functions cause lots of collateral damage.\u201dEvolving DefenseIn terms of how defenders can start to cope with these new trends, Lambert pointed out that machine learning can provide the edge that the security industry needs to stay up with the threats; he noted that in general, defense is moving from \u201cusing security to protect data, to using data to provide security.\u201d\u201cNow, the data and the telemetry and customer traffic information are all giving us a picture of the attacks, and this is informing how security works,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cTo analyze that, machine learning is becoming an important tool.\u201dHe used the concrete example of Windows error reporting to show how this could be put into action. When something crashes on Windows, a report is sent to Microsoft; as a result, Lambert said that the software giant receives billions of crash reports per month.\u201cThe first thing we do is to \u2018bucket\u2019 what\u2019s coming in so engineers can work on this efficiently,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cWhen a line of code crashes, we receive the app name, version and timestamp; the module\u2019s version and timestamp; exception code; and what\u2019s offset in the module at fault. So, it fingerprints the event.\u201dMachine learning helps \u2018fingerprint\u2019 incidents.He said that when these reports are viewed through the lens of security, it\u2019s possible to identify those that need further examination. For instance, if an exception code that corresponds to an unknown stack buffer overrun is identified.\u201cIn that case, we know it\u2019s security-relevant,\u201d Lambert explained. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s an exploit, but it\u2019s worth further investigation.\u201dSimilarly, the fingerprint will show if, say, there was a CSRS.exe involved with no file version (likely malware); if the crash involved a known exploit for the code in question, and sometimes it can detect if it could be a zero-day is headed into the wild.After this initial examination, researchers can use the crash\u2019s full data dump to better evaluate what\u2019s happening.\u201cThe idea is to analyze things in minutes, not hours, so systems are evolving towards targeted, tailored, deeper analysis, using telemetry as its heart,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThe good news is that many security systems connect to the cloud to collect telemetry and send information back. We are very much moving to a world where security\u2019s value is the product plus the data coming from your customers.\u201d\u00a0Cloud SecurityMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "MONTREAL \u2014 A serious flaw in how macOS handles code signatures can lead to the compromise of multiple applications on Apple computers. Worse, the issue is largely unknown to most Mac users, and even most Mac administrators.\u201cBecause macOS checks code signatures very infrequently, it is easily possible to hijack a legitimate application that is already installed on the system without triggering any kind of code signature check,\u201d said researcher Thomas Reed, director of Mac and mobile research at Malwarebytes.In a talk at Virus Bulletin 2018 in Montreal on Wednesday, Reed explained that the Mac platform won\u2019t run apps that aren\u2019t code-signed; macOS will automatically block anything trying to execute without a valid signature. The upsides to this are obvious, he noted. \u201cThis approach gives Apple really good control over a Mac\u2019s application environment. You can\u2019t distribute an unsigned app, nor can you push out one that\u2019s had its signature revoked,\u201d he said.However, the way Apple handles this process has a hole in it.Apps are essentially quarantined when they\u2019re downloaded by a Mac user; any executable is given an initial caution flag. The system then checks the code signature, and makes sure the application is not a known piece of malware. If it passes, the app is given clearance on the machine as a piece of trusted software.That\u2019s where the issue lies. At that point, macOS stops checking that application, once the quarantine flag is wiped out.\u201cFrom now on, it will open as an already-trusted app that never gets checked again by the gatekeeper,\u201d said Reed.And that means that malefactors can infect almost any application already running on the machine (if, of course, they\u2019ve gained access to the user\u2019s software libraries).\u201cAn attacker would simply replace the legit executable in an app bundle with a malicious copy \u2013 and then rename the original to something else,\u201d Reed explained. In a proof-of-concept that he developed, the malicious executable will then launch when the application is called \u2013 but it also launches the renamed legitimate file. This means the application will appear to have its usual functionality while the malicious functions launch in the background \u2013 so the user isn\u2019t aware of anything being amiss.\u201cMost people are not at all suspicious of programs they have been using for some time without any issues,\u201d Reed noted.ExploitationReed said that some aspects of this attack have been seen in the wild in the past (and it should be noted that other code-signing problems with Apple have been observed). However, he said that all past incidents have involved altering the code prior to downloading \u2014 so doing it after-the-fact represents a new (or at least, very little-known) attack vector.\u201cWe have seen malware using this flaw where the bad actors take a legitimate app, make changes, re-sign it with some other code certificate and redistribute it,\u201d Reed said, noting that this was seen in the distribution of the KeRanger ransomware in 2016. \u201c[But] there have been no modern cases of mac malware modifying a legitimate application that is already on the hard drive.\u201dFurther, the issue is straightforward and easy to exploit. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science in a way that\u2019s kind of frightening,\u201d he said. Accordingly, the researcher said he was able to take a \u201cscriptkiddy\u201d approach to developing the PoC for the flaw.\u201cA little basic shell scripting and AppleScripting knowledge, plus a rudimentary knowledge of Swift basics, was all that would be needed, with a little Googling to fill in the gaps,\u201d Reed explained. \u201cAnybody can do this, so this is a little scarier to me than some fancy CVE that an elite hacker would do.\u201dThe resulting PoC consisted of 22 lines of Swift code for the malicious executable, 18 lines of AppleScript for the first part of the dropper, and 16 lines of shell script for the second part of the dropper.In the PoC, if the dropper executes, it infects all of the applications in the app folder.DetectionThere are some silver linings to all of this. For one, there are potential giveaways for users.For one, the PoC results in \u201cdouble-dock\u201d icons where the infected app has two icons stacked on top of each other \u2013 representing the malicious process and the legitimate one.\u201cThe malicious executable won\u2019t quit bouncing, like a kid on sugar, and the other one looks normal, so it\u2019s immediately suspicious,\u201d Reed said. This can however be rectified with coding changes.Another giveaway is that there will be two processes in the activity monitor. The \u201cmalicious\u201d process and the renamed, legitimate process.Users can also use the osquery function to check the signatures of their applications.\u201cThis treats the system like an SQL database, and you can do any number of queries,\u201d explained Reed. \u201cAfter infection, the app will show as unsigned and will have no team identifier, for instance, so you can scan for that. You can also monitor apps for changes.\u201dThere\u2019s also a preventative option, in the form of Santa, a Google tool. It literally determines what\u2019s naughty and what\u2019s nice in terms of code on machines.\u201cUsing this in lockdown mode will allow whitelisted apps to run, while modified apps will be blocked, so malicious code really can\u2019t execute,\u201d Reed said.And finally, there also are some exceptions when it comes to what\u2019s vulnerable. All of Apple\u2019s own apps and some third-party software do their own internal code-signing checks, and if they fail, they crash.What\u2019s almost certain is that Apple will be unlikely to address this anytime soon, since macOS is functioning how it\u2019s meant to, Reed said.\u201cIf Apple were checking code signatures on every single process every time one launches \u2013 and these systems have thousands of processes \u2013 this could be resource-intensive and a real drain on your system,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThis will be a long-standing problem. My feeling is that this isn\u2019t going away anytime soon.\u201dThe best approach is for developers to build in checks for their own signatures when they run.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame but I think that\u2019s the only practical way to address this in the short term,\u201d Reed said. He added, \u201c[Unfortunately], most developers are not aware of this, and do not add their own code signature self-checks. This means that there are countless vulnerable Mac applications in existence on the market.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Uncategorized",

        "raw text": "Microsoft researchers have uncovered a massive phishing campaign that can steal credentials even if a user has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled and has so far attempted to compromise more than 10,000 organizations.The campaign, which has been active since September 2021, depends upon the use of adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing sites in the initial attacks to hijack session cookies and steal credentials. From there, attackers can access victims\u2019 user mailboxes to launch further attacks against other targets, the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MTIC) wrote in a blog post published Tuesday.In AiTM attacks, a threat actor deploys a proxy server between a target user and the website the user wishes to visit\u2013that is, the site the attacker wishes to impersonate, researchers explained.\u201cSuch a setup allows the attacker to steal and intercept the target\u2019s password and the session cookie that proves their ongoing and authenticated session with the website,\u201d they wrote.It\u2019s important to point out that this type of attack does not denote a vulnerability in the type of MFA employed by a corporate email system, they added. AiTM phishing steals the session cookie, so the attacker gets authenticated to a session on the user\u2019s behalf regardless of the sign-in method the latter uses, researchers said.Indeed, attackers are getting wise to organizations\u2019 increasing use of MFA to better secure user accounts and creating more sophisticated phishing attacks like these that can bypass it, noted a security professional.\u201cWhile MFA is certainly valuable and should be used when possible, by capturing the password and session cookie\u2013and because the session cookie shows that MFA was already used to login\u2013the attackers can often circumvent the need for MFA when they login to the account again later using the stolen password,\u201d observed Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at security awareness training firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.AiTM Phishing, UnpackedIn their observation of the campaign, Microsoft researchers took a deeper dive into how these types of attacks work and how they can be used to mount secondary business email compromise (BEC) attacks once initial access to someone\u2019s account is gained, they said.AiTM phishing attacks depend upon the session that every modern web service implements with a user after successful authentication so that the user doesn\u2019t have to be authenticated at every new page they visit, researchers explained.\u201cThis session functionality is implemented through a session cookie\u00a0provided by an authentication service after initial authentication,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe session cookie is proof for the web server that the user has been authenticated and has an ongoing session on the website.\u201dIn AiTM phishing, an attacker attempts to steal a target user\u2019s session cookie so they can skip the whole authentication process and act as if they are the legitimate authenticated user, researchers said.\u201cTo do this,\u00a0the attacker\u00a0deploys\u00a0a webserver that proxies\u00a0HTTP packets\u00a0from the user that visits the\u00a0phishing\u00a0site\u00a0to the target server the attacker\u00a0wishes\u00a0to impersonate\u00a0and\u00a0the other way around,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis way, the phishing site is visually identical to the original website\u00a0(as every HTTP is proxied to and from the original website).\u201dThis attack is especially convenient for threat actors because it precludes the need for them to craft their own\u00a0phishing sites such as the ones used in conventional phishing campaigns, researchers noted.Specific Attack VectorIn the phishing campaign observed by Microsoft researchers, attackers initiate contact with potential victims by sending emails with an HTML file attachment to multiple recipients in different organizations. The messages claim that the recipients have a voicemail message and need to click on the attachment to access it or it will be deleted in 24 hours.If a user clicks on the link, they are redirected to a site that tells them they will be redirected again to their mailbox with the audio in an hour. Meanwhile, they are asked to sign in with their credentials.At this point, however, the attack does something unique using clever coding by automatically filling in the phishing landing page with the user\u2019s email address, \u201cthus enhancing its social engineering lure,\u201d researchers noted.If a target enters his or her credentials and gets authenticated, he or she is redirected to the legitimate Microsoft office.com page. However, in the background, the attacker intercepts the credentials and gets authenticated on the user\u2019s behalf, providing free reign to perform follow-on activities, researchers said.In the phishing email chain that researchers observed, the threat actor used the authentication to commit payment fraud in secondary attacks from within the organization, researchers said.Follow-Up BEC and Payment FraudAttackers took less than five minutes after hijacking sessions and stealing credentials to begin the process of conducting payment fraud by authenticating to Outlook to access finance-related emails and file attachments, researchers said. The following day, they accessed these emails and files every few hours to search for opportunities to commit fraud.The threat actor also deleted from the compromised account\u2019s Inbox folder the original phishing email they sent to hide traces of their initial access, researchers added.\u201cThese activities suggest the attacker attempted to commit payment fraud manually,\u201d they wrote.Attackers also used Outlook Web Access (OWA) on a Chrome browser to commit payment fraud while using the compromised account\u2019s stolen session cookie, researchers added.FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office.

        "raw text": "A new callback phishing campaign is impersonating prominent security companies to try to trick potential victims into making a phone call that will instruct them to download malware.Researchers at CrowdStrike Intelligence discovered the campaign because CrowdStrike is actually one of the companies, among other security firms, being impersonated, they said in a recent blog post.The campaign employs a typical phishing email aiming to fool a victim into replying with urgency\u2014in this case, implying that the recipient\u2019s company has been breached and insisting that they call a phone number included in the message, researchers wrote. If a person targeted calls the number, they reach someone who directs them to a website with malicious intent, they said.\u201cHistorically, callback campaign operators attempt to persuade victims to install commercial RAT software to gain an initial foothold on the network,\u201d researchers wrote in the post.Researchers likened the campaign to one discovered last year dubbed BazarCall by the Wizard Spider threat group. That campaign used a similar tactic to try to spur people to make a phone call to opt-out of renewing an online service the recipient purportedly is currently using, Sophos researchers explained at the time.If people made the call, a friendly person on the other side would give them a website address where the soon-to-be victim could supposedly unsubscribe from the service. However, that website instead led them to a malicious download.CrowdStrike also identified a campaign in March of this year in which threat actors used a callback phishing campaign to install AteraRMM followed by Cobalt Strike to assist with lateral movement and deploy additional malware, CrowdStrike researchers said.Impersonating a Trusted PartnerResearchers did not specify what other security companies were being impersonated in the campaign, which they identified on July 8, they said. In their blog post, they included a screenshot of the email sent to recipients impersonating CrowdStrike, which appears legitimate by using the company\u2019s logo.Specifically, the email informs the target that it\u2019s coming from their company\u2019s \u201coutsourced data security services vendor,\u201d and that \u201cabnormal activity\u201d has been detected on the \u201csegment of the network which your workstation is a part of.\u201dThe message claims that the victim\u2019s IT department already has been notified but that their participation is required to perform an audit on their individual workstation, according to CrowdStrike. The email instructs the recipient to call a number provided so this can be done, which is when the malicious activity occurs.Though researchers were not able to identify the malware variant being used in the campaign, they believe with high likelihood that it will include \u201ccommon legitimate remote administration tools (RATs) for initial access, off-the-shelf penetration testing tools for lateral movement, and the deployment of ransomware or data extortion,\u201d they wrote.Potential to Spread RansomwareResearchers also assessed with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that callback operators in the campaign \u201cwill likely use ransomware to monetize their operation,\u201d they said, \u201cas 2021 BazarCall campaigns would eventually lead to Conti ransomware,\u201d they said.\u201cThis is the first identified callback campaign impersonating cybersecurity entities and has higher potential success given the urgent nature of cyber breaches,\u201d researchers wrote.Further, they stressed that CrowdStrike would never contact customers in this way, and urged any of their customers receiving such emails to forward phishing emails to the address csirt@crowdstrike.com.This assurance is key particularly with cybercriminals becoming so adept at social engineering tactics that appear perfectly legitimate to unsuspecting targets of malicious campaigns, noted one security professional.\u201cOne of the most important facets of effective cybersecurity awareness training is educating users beforehand on how they will or will not be contacted, and what information or actions they may be asked to take,\u201d Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at cybersecurity company Cerberus Sentinel, wrote in an email to Threatpost. \u201cIt is critical that users understand how they may be contacted by legitimate internal or external departments, and this goes beyond just cybersecurity.\u201dRegister Now for this On-demand Event: Join Threatpost and Intel Security\u2019s Tom Garrison in a Threatpost roundtable discussing innovation enabling stakeholders to stay ahead of a dynamic threat landscape.

        "raw text": "Researchers have identified a never-before-seen method for sneaking malicious links into email inboxes.The clever trick takes advantage of a key difference in how email inboxes and browsers read URLs, according a Monday report by Perception Point.The attacker crafted an unusual link using an \u201c@\u201d symbol in the middle. Ordinary email security filters interpreted it as a comment, but browsers interpreted it as a legitimate web domain. Thus the phishing emails successfully bypassed security, but when targets clicked on the link inside, they were directed to a fake landing page nonetheless.A Lame Phishing AttemptOn May 2, Perception Point\u2019s incident response (IR) team flagged a hasily-designed phishing email trying to pass itself off as a Microsoft notice. \u201cYou have new 5 held messages,\u201d it read, directing the recipient to follow a \u201cPersonal Portal\u201d hyperlink.The link directed to a website masquerading as an Outlook login page. Again the hacker\u2019s design choices were poor, and the domain name for this supposed Outlook page was, in fact, \u201cstorageapi.fleek.co,\u201d followed by a long series of random characters.In theory, if a user had overlooked all of these red flags, and submitted their Microsoft credentials, those credentials would\u2019ve gone to the attacker.So here\u2019s the mystery: how did such a low-effort phishing attempt make it past email security filters, which are trained to spot much more sophisticated frauds than this?The key was in the email link.Some Background on LinksPause here for a moment, and open up another webpage in your browser.Type \u201chttps://\u201d into your address bar, then any string of characters you want. Next, type an @ symbol, followed by any web domain. For example:https[://]abc123@www[.]threatpost.comDepending on what browser you\u2019re using, that text before the @ will either return an error message, or disappear without a trace. Why?Well, some browsers enable you to automatically send authentication information to the website you want to visit. The syntax is as follows:http(s)://username[:]password[@]server/resource[.]extBrowsers that support this feature will interpret the string before the @ sign as login credentials. Browsers that don\u2019t will simply ignore the string and execute whatever follows the @. Either way, the domain following @ is where you\u2019ll be going.In January, Microsoft removed this feature from Internet Explorer because of how easily hackers can use it to mask malicious websites as legitimate ones. They explained how:For example, the following URL appears to open http://www[.]wingtiptoys[.]com but actually opens http://example[.]com:http://www[.]wingtiptoys[.]com@example[.]comWhich brings us to the crux of today\u2019s news\u2026The Hacker\u2019s TrickThe URL embedded in the phishing emails from our story was:As we\u2019ve established, browsers will read this as a URL. But email services read the @ symbol in the middle very differently.\u201cIt is common knowledge that an @ sign will be ignored by email security systems when used within the text of an email, and there are many instances of this being used legitimately,\u201d Motti Elloul, vice president of customer success and incident response at Perception Point, told Threatpost via email, \u201cFor example, it can be used to refer to user information within the body of the message.\u201d For this reason, the IR team wrote in their report, \u201cmost email detection platforms cannot recognize this address as a URL, and instead see it as a comment.\u201dThe @ symbol is a cover: to an email security filter it\u2019s a comment, but underneath it\u2019s a regular old malicious link.The ImpactOur hacker \u2013 unknown but for an IP address 202[.]172.25[.]42, coming from Japan \u2013 went after \u201ca wide range of targets, including telecom, web services and financial organizations,\u201d said Elloul. None of their emails managed to trick any targets before they were discovered.Despite the failure of this particular campaign, Elloul told Threatpost, \u201cthe technique has the potential to catch on quickly, because it\u2019s very easy to execute.\u201d As a proof of concept, at least, it proved rather effective.\u201cIn order to identify the technique and avoid the fallout from it slipping past security systems, security teams need to update their detection engines in order to double check the URL structure whenever @ is included.\u201dHacks",

        "raw text": "The ever-evolving banking trojan IcedID is back again with a phishing campaign that uses previously compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send emails that appear to come from legitimate accounts. Attackers also are using stealthy new payload-delivery tactics to spread the modular malware.Researchers from Intezer earlier this month uncovered the campaign, which employs thread hijacking to send malicious messages from stolen Exchange accounts, thus adding an extra level of evasion to the campaign\u2019s malicious intent, wrote researchers Joakim Kennedy and Ryan Robinson in a blog post published Monday.The actors behind IcedID \u2013 as well as other spearphishers \u2013 have previously used phishing emails that \u201creuse previously stolen emails to make the lure more convincing,\u201d researchers wrote. However, this time the threat has evolved in a couple of key ways that make it even more dangerous to targets, which include organizations within energy, healthcare, law and pharmaceutical sectors, researchers noted.Not only is the threat actor now using compromised Microsoft Exchange servers to send the phishing emails from the account that they stole from, but the delivery of the malicious payload also has shifted in a way that can execute malware without the user even knowing, researchers said.\u201cThe payload has also moved away from using office documents to the use of ISO files with a Windows LNK file and a DLL file,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cThe use of ISO files allows the threat actor to bypass the Mark-of-the-Web controls, resulting in execution of the malware without warning to the user.\u201dPreviously the infection chain most commonly associated with IcedID phishing campaigns has been an email with an attached password-protected ZIP archive that contains a macro-enabled Office document, which executes the IcedID installer.Breakdown of the Attack ChainThe new campaign starts with a phishing email that includes a message about an important document and includes a password-protected ZIP archive file attached, the password for which is included in the email body.The email seems extra convincing to users because it uses what\u2019s called \u201cthread hijacking,\u201d in which attackers use a portion of a previous thread from a legitimate email found in the inbox of the stolen account.\u201cBy using this approach, the email appears more legitimate and is transported through the normal channels which can also include security products,\u201d researchers wrote.The majority of the originating Exchange servers that researchers observed in the campaign appear to be unpatched and publicly exposed, \u201cmaking the ProxyShell vector a good theory,\u201d they wrote. ProxyShell is a remote-code execution (RCE) bug discovered in Exchange Servers last year that has since been patched but has been throttled by attackers.Once unzipped, the attached file includes a single \u201cISO\u201d file with the same file name as the ZIP archive that was created not that long before the email was sent. That ISO file includes two files: a LNK file named \u201cdocument\u201d and a DLL file named \u201cmain,\u201d also prepared relatively recently and potentially used in previous phishing email, researchers said.When a user double clicks the LNK file, it uses \u201cregsvr32\u201d to execute the DLL file, which allows for proxy execution of malicious code in main.dll for defense evasion, they wrote in the post. The DLL file is a loader for the IcedID payload.The loader will locate the encrypted payload, which is stored in the resource section of the binary, through the technique API hashing. The resulting hash is then compared with a hardcoded hash, locating the call for FindResourceA, which is dynamically called to fetch the encrypted payload, researchers wrote.The ultimate step in the attack chain is that the IcedID \u201cGziploader\u201d payload is decoded and placed in memory and then executed. The GZiploader fingerprints the machine and sends a beacon to the command-and-control (C2) server \u2013 located at yourgroceries[.]top. \u2013 with information about the infected host, which then can be used for further nefarious activity.Evolution of a ThreatResearchers at IBM first discovered IcedID back in 2017 as a trojan targeting banks, payment card providers, mobile services providers, payroll, web mail and e-commerce sites.The malware has evolved over the years and already has a storied history of clever obfuscation. For example, it resurfaced during the COVID-19 campaign with new functionality that uses steganography \u2013 the practice of hiding code within images to stealthily infect victims \u2013 as well as other enhancements.The new campaign is evidence of its further evolution and could signify that IcedID is indeed becoming, as many fear, the new Emotet \u2013 a modular threat that began as a trojan but steadily evolved into one of the most dangerous malwares ever seen.\u201cThis attack shows how much effort attackers put in all the time to evade detection and why defense in depth is necessary,\u201d observed Saumitra Das, CTO and co-founder at security firm Blue Hexagon, in an email to Threatpost.This time and effort, in turn, shows a level of sophistication on the part of those behind IcedID in that they have thorough knowledge of contemporary email protections and are continuously adding new tactics as security also grows and evolves, he said.\u201cMany email security systems use reputation of senders to block malicious email without being able to assess the email itself,\u201d Das noted. \u201cHere, they used compromised Exchange servers to make it through.\u201dThe group\u2019s use of obfuscated file formats to deliver malware, as well as the final payload\u2019s delivery over the network, also demonstrate that the threat actors know how to evade signature and sandboxes, he added.\u201cThese attacks often go much deeper than simply stealing data,\u201d concurred Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at security firm Cerberus Sentinel, in an email to Threatpost. \u201cThe cybercriminals take the time to read through the mailboxes to understand the inter-organization relationships and operating procedures.\u201cTo protect themselves from similar attacks, it\u2019s critical that organizations ensure that they apply security patches promptly and thoroughly in their environment,\u201d he added. However, what is historically true for patching remains true now: that it\u2019s \u201ca task that\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d Clemens acknowledged.\u201cIt really takes a cultural approach to cybersecurity to plan for failures in defenses like patch management,\u201d he said.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "We\u2019ve had it beaten into our brains: Before you go wily-nily clicking on a page, check the URL. First things first, the tried-and-usually-but-not-always-true advice goes, check that the site\u2019s URL shows \u201chttps,\u201d indicating that the site is secured with TLS/SSL encryption.If only it were that easy to avoid phishing sites. In reality, URL reliability hasn\u2019t been absolute for a long time, given things like homograph attacks that swap in similar-looking characters in order to create new, identical-looking but malicious URLs, as well as DNS hijacking, in which Domain Name System (DNS) queries are subverted.Now, there\u2019s one more way to trick targets into coughing up sensitive info, with a coding ruse that\u2019s invisible to the naked eye. The novel phishing technique, described last week by a penetration tester and security researcher who goes by the handle mr.d0x, is called a browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack.The novel method takes advantage of third-party single sign-on (SSO) options embedded on websites that issue popup windows for authentication, such as \u201cSign in with Google,\u201d Facebook, Apple or Microsoft.The researcher used Canva as an example: In the log-in window for Canva shown below, the popup asks users to authenticate via their Google account.Login to Canva using Google account credentials. Source: mr.d0xIt\u2019s Easy to Fabricate an Identical, Malicious PopupThese days, SSO popups are a routine way to authenticate when you sign in.But according to mr.d0x\u2019s post, completely fabricating a malicious version of a popup window is a snap: It\u2019s \u201cquite simple\u201d using basic HTML/CSS, the researcher said. The concocted popups simulate a browser window within the browser, spoofing a legitimate domain and making it possible to stage convincing phishing attacks.\u201cCombine the window design with an iframe pointing to the malicious server hosting the phishing page, and [it\u2019s] basically indistinguishable,\u201d mr.d0x wrote. The report provided an image, included below, that shows a side-by-side of a fake window next to the real window.Nearly identical real vs. fake login pages. Source: mr.d0x.\u201cVery few people would notice the slight differences between the two,\u201d according to the report.JavaScript can make the window appear on a link, button click or page loading screen, the report continued. As well, libraries \u2013 such as the popular JQuery JavaScript library \u2013 can make the window appear visually appealing \u2026 or, at least, visually bouncy, as depicted in the .gif provided in the researcher\u2019s demo and shown below.BitB demo. Source: mr.d0x.Hovering Over Links: Another Easily Fooled Security SafeguardThe BitB attack can also flummox those who use the trick of hovering over a URL to figure out if it\u2019s legitimate, the researcher said: If JavaScript is permitted, the security safeguard is rendered ineffective.The writeup pointed to how HTML for a link generally looks, as in this sample:<a href=\u201dhttps://gmail.com\u201d>Google</a>\u201cIf an onclick event that returns false is added, then hovering over the link will continue to show the website in the href attribute but when the link is clicked then the href attribute is ignored,\u201d the researcher explained.\u201cWe can use this knowledge to make the pop-up window appear more realistic,\u201d they said, providing this visually undetectable HTML trick:<a href=\u201dhttps://gmail.com\u201d onclick=\u201dreturn launchWindow();\u201d>Google</a>function launchWindow(){// Launch the fake authentication windowreturn false; // This will make sure the href attribute is ignored}All the More Reason for MFAThus does the BitB technique undercut both the fact that a URL contains the \u201chttps\u201d encryption designation as a trustworthy site, as well as the hover-over-it security check.\u201cWith this technique we are now able to up our phishing game,\u201d the researcher concluded.Granted, a target user would still need to land on a threat actor\u2019s website for the malicious popup window to be displayed. But once the fly has landed in the spider\u2019s web, there\u2019s nothing alarming to make them struggle against the idea of handing over SSO credentials.\u201cOnce landed on the attacker-owned website, the user will be at ease as they type their credentials away on what appears to be the legitimate website (because the trustworthy URL says so),\u201d mr.d0x wrote.But there are other security checks that the BitB attack would have to overcome: namely, those that don\u2019t rely on the fallibility of human eyeballs. Password managers, for example, probably wouldn\u2019t autofill credentials into a fake BitB popup because software wouldn\u2019t interpret the as a real browser window.Lucas Budman, CEO of passwordless workforce identity management firm TruU, said that with these attacks, it\u2019s just a matter of time before people fork over their passwords to the wrong person, thereby relegating multifactor authentication (MFA) to \u201ca single factor as the password is already compromised.\u201dBudman told Threatpost on Monday that password reuse makes it particularly dangerous, including sites that aren\u2019t MFA-enabled.\u201cAs long as username/password is used, even with 2FA, it is completely vulnerable to such attacks,\u201d he said via email. \u201cAs bad actors get more sophisticated with their attacks, the move to passwordless MFA is more critical now than ever. Eliminate the attack vector by eliminating the password with password-less MFA.\u201dBy passwordless MFA, he is, of course, referring to ditching passwords or other knowledge-based secrets in favor of providing a secure proof of identity through a registered device or token. GitHub, for one, made a move on this front in May 2021, when it added support for FIDO2 security keys for Git over SSH in order to fend off account hijacking and further its plan to stick a fork in the security bane of passwords.The portable FIDO2 fobs are used for SSH authentication to secure Git operations and to forestall the misery that unfurls when private keys accidentally get lost or pilfered, when malware tries to initiate requests without user approval or when researchers come up with newfangled ways to bamboozle eyeballs \u2013 BitB being a case in point.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Over the weekend, hackers stole millions of dollars worth of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) belonging to 17 members of the OpenSea NFT marketplace.On Saturday, a small number of OpenSea users noticed their NFTs were missing. (NFTs are digital tokens on the blockchain that represent ownership over virtual assets, such as digital drawings or music.)\u201cPanic erupted\u201d wrote Molly White, who runs the blog Web3 is Going Great, because \u201cmany others feared the same could happen to them.\u201dClick to Register for FREESpeculation abounded that a glitch might have arisen from OpenSea\u2019s smart contract \u2013 i.e., the software that the platform runs on \u2013 or perhaps from a widely disseminated token airdrop carried out by a knockoff NFT marketplace called X2Y2.The real cause was much more interesting.About an hour and a half after the NFTs went missing, OpenSea tweeted that, in fact, the phenomenon appeared \u201cto be a phishing attack originating outside of OpenSea\u2019s website.\u201dWe are actively investigating rumors of an exploit associated with OpenSea related smart contracts. This appears to be a phishing attack originating outside of OpenSea's website. Do not click links outside of https://t.co/3qvMZjxmDB.\u2014 OpenSea (@opensea) February 20, 2022Hackers, it turned out, had used some clever social engineering to phish unwitting investors.Bait-and-Switch ContractOn Friday, OpenSea had launched a new smart contract. Quickly, a malicious actor copied and re-sent OpenSea\u2019s email blast notifying users.Those who opened the copycat email were directed to a copycat webpage. There, they were prompted to sign a seemingly legitimate transaction that, purportedly, would migrate their NFTs from the old to the new contract.Instead, clicking \u201cSign\u201d triggered a function called \u201catomicMatch_.\u201d As Check Point Software described on Sunday, \u201cthis kind of request is capable of stealing all victim NFTS in one transaction.\u201dEngineer Head-BangersUnfortunately phishing attacks and social engineering remain some of the hardest security issues to solve as an engineer, noted Matt Bailey, VP of Engineering at Club NFT, via email. That isn\u2019t new to Web3 \u2013 a hazy term for blockchain-based, decentralized systems and technology meant to replace our current internet \u2013 but \u201cit does come with some new wrinkles,\u201d Bailey said.\u201cGeneral usability continues to be a challenge and can contribute to confusion. Understanding what it is you are signing digitally as a user is not always obvious,\u201d he explained.Because blockchain transactions are irreversible, the threat of one wrong click is arguably even greater than in traditional IT attacks.At first, CEO Devin Finzer reported that 32 OpenSea users had fallen victim to the ruse. That figure turned out to be an overshot. New findings on Monday clarified that the \u201coriginal count included anyone who had *interacted* with the attacker, rather than those who were victims of the phishing attack.\u201d1) We\u2019ve narrowed down the list of impacted individuals to 17, rather than the previously mentioned 32. Our original count included anyone who had *interacted* with the attacker, rather than those who were victims of the phishing attack.\u2014 OpenSea (@opensea) February 21, 2022In the end, 250 NFTs were stolen from just 17 users.Even with so few victims, however, the monetary impact of this campaign was extraordinary.OpenSea is one of the most recognizable names in the NFT \u2013 as in, the cryptocurrency/blockchain/metaverse \u2013 space. As of January 2022, the company was valued at $13.3 billion. Daily trading activity on OpenSea has tended to fluctuate between $100M-$200M per day, with $3.68 billion worth of NFT transactions occurring in only the past 30 days, according to DappRadar. According to blockchain research firm Chainalysis, the total market for NFTs reached $41 billion in 2021.The growing value of NFTs helps explain why this particular attacker was able to flip just 17 victims\u2019 assets for around $1.7 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).Such a high-profile incident \u201cpresents the opportunity to improve both personal and marketplace security,\u201d observed Jake Fraser, Head of Business Development for the NFT marketplace Mogul Productions.Blockchain companies will be encouraged to invest in third-party smart contract auditing and bug bounty programs and will place a greater emphasis on educating investors about risks, he told Threatpost on Monday via Telegram. \u201cWhen individuals get more educated, it prevents the likelihood of phishing attacks taking place. Most people in the space are still using hot [online] wallets to store their NFTs, so this is why it is crucial that they know how to identify the red flags when a phishing attack is taking place.\u201dData from Etherscan indicates that this particular campaign may be over, given that the account trafficking the stolen NFTs had initiated only one transaction in the 30 hours preceding the time this article was written on Monday afternoon ET.Join Threatpost on Wed.

        "raw text": "Emotionally vulnerable and willing to offer up any information that lands the gig, job seekers are prime targets for social engineering campaigns. And with the \u201cGreat Resignation\u201d in full swing, cybercriminals are having an easy time finding their next victim.Just since Feb. 1, analysts have watched phishing email attacks impersonating LinkedIn surge 232 percent, attempting to trick job seekers into giving up their credentials.\u201cCurrent employment trends help to make this attack more convincing,\u201d a new report from Egress said. \u201c\u2018The Great Resignation\u2019 continues to dominate headlines, and a record number of Americans left their jobs in 2021 for new opportunities. It is likely these phishing attacks aim to capitalize on jobseekers (plus curious individuals) by flattering them into believing their profile is being viewed and their experience is relevant to household brands.\u201dThe emails had subject lines that would be enticing to job hunters hoping to get noticed, like, \u201cWho\u2019s searching for you online,\u201d \u201cYou appeared in 4 searches this week\u201d or even \u201cYou have 1 new message,\u201d the Egress team said.The phishing emails themselves were convincing dupes, built in HTML templates with the LinkedIn logo, colors and icons, the report added. The scammers also name-checked well-known companies throughout the bodies of the phishing emails, including American Express and CVS Carepoint, to make the correspondence seem more legitimate, the analysts said.Even the email\u2019s footer lifted the company\u2019s headquarters\u2019 address and included \u201cunsubscribe\u201d links to add to the email\u2019s authenticity, the analysts pointed out.\u201cYou can also see the LinkedIn display name spoofing, which is designed to hide the webmail accounts used to launch the attacks,\u201d the report said.LinkedIn phishing email. Source: Egress.Once the victim clicks on the malicious links in the email, they were directed to a site to harvest their LinkedIn logins and passwords.\u201cWhile the display name is always LinkedIn and the emails all follow a similar pattern, the phishing attacks are sent from different webmail addresses that have zero correlation with each other,\u201d the analysts added. \u201cCurrently, it is unknown whether these attacks are the work of one cybercriminal or a gang operating together.\u201d021722 09:18 UPDATE: LinkedIn sent the following statement to Threatpost:\u201cOur internal teams work to take action against those who attempt to harm LinkedIn members through phishing. We encourage members to report suspicious messages and help them learn more about what they can do to protect themselves, including turning on\u00a0two-step verification.

Collecting publicly available information isn\u2019t itself a data breach, but collected in mass quantities, it can be a weapon wielded against users in social-engineering attacks.Last summer, a massive data-scraping attack against LinkedIn was discovered to have collected at least 1.2 billion user records that were later sold on underground forums. At the time, LinkedIn reiterated that the scraped data was public information, not private information, and didn\u2019t qualify as a breach.LinkedIn isn\u2019t really at fault here, according to Yehuda Rosen, senior software engineer at nVisium.\u201cThis has little to do with LinkedIn specifically \u2013 they\u2019re not doing anything wrong here,\u201d Rosen explained to Threatpost. \u201cIt boils down to the fact that LinkedIn has hundreds of millions of members \u2013 many of whom are very accustomed to seeing frequent legitimate emails from LinkedIn \u2013 and may inevitably click without carefully checking that each and every email is the real deal.\u201dThat leaves it to individual users to be mindful of the information they expose publicly and how it could be used to trick them into clicking on a malicious link.\u201cWhile I don\u2019t believe that this will hurt LinkedIn\u2019s brand, this does reiterate the importance of email phishing education,\u201d Ray Kelly, with NTT Application Security, told Threatpost by email. \u201cGiven these emails are coming from a legit LinkedIn email address makes it especially difficult to identify the danger. My rule is to never click on email links. Always visit the site directly.\u201dJoin Threatpost on Wed.

        "raw text": "More and more phishing kits are focusing on bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods, researchers have warned \u2013 typically by stealing authentication tokens via a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack.As MFA continues to see widespread consumer and business adoption \u2013 a full 78 percent of respondents in a recent poll said they used it in 2021 \u2013 cybercriminals have devoted resources into keeping up. According to an analysis from Proofpoint, MFA-bypass phishing kits are proliferating rapidly, \u201cranging from simple open-source kits with human readable code and no-frills functionality to sophisticated kits utilizing numerous layers of obfuscation and built-in modules that allow for stealing usernames, passwords, MFA tokens, Social Security numbers and credit-card numbers.\u201dResearchers also noted that MFA-bypass kits represent a security blind spot, with the associated IP addresses and domains often skating by VirusTotal detection.Transparent Reverse Proxy TrickeryAccording to Proofpoint, one of the phishing-kit approaches that\u2019s particularly gaining steam is the use of transparent reverse proxies (TRPs), which enable attackers to insert themselves into existing browser sessions. This MiTM approach lets adversaries hide out and harvest information as it\u2019s entered or appears on the screen.This is a big departure from traditional phishing, which involves attackers creating copycat sites that mimic, say, an actual Windows log-in page in order to trick targets into entering their credentials. That traditional approach leaves plenty of room for red flags to be introduced, such as outdated logos, poor syntax, spelling errors and the like.TRP kits show \u201cthe actual website to the victim,\u201d researchers noted in a Thursday analysis. \u201cModern web pages are dynamic and change frequently. Therefore, presenting the actual site instead of a facsimile greatly enhances the illusion an individual is logging in safely.\u201dMeanwhile, attackers will hang out and steal session cookies, which can then be used by the threat actor to gain access to the targeted account without the need for a username, password or MFA token.Proofpoint said that there are three TRP kits in particular that have seen upticks in use lately.Developed by a Polish security researcher, Modliska has been on the scene since late 2018. Proofpoint researchers said that it\u2019s a simple affair, allowing users to phish just one site at a time. It uses a command line interface and has a GUI-based mechanism for stealing credentials and session information, they added.\u201cModlishka also integrates Let\u2019s Encrypt so it can make the fake domain landing page just a bit more believable by encrypting the traffic and providing the little padlock in the web bar,\u201d they said. \u201c[It\u2019s also] capable of harvesting a victim\u2019s session even when tech like Duo\u2019s push notification authenticator is used.\u201dMuraena/Necrobrowser, first released in 2019, is a kit that comes in two parts, according to Proofpoint.The first part is Muraena, which \u201cruns server-side and uses a crawler to scan the target site to ensure it can properly rewrite all the traffic needed, to not alert the victim,\u201d researchers explained. It harvests the victim\u2019s credentials and session cookie, then deploys Necrobrowser.\u201cNecrobrowser is a headless browser, which is a browser without a GUI used for automation, that leverages the stolen session cookies to log into the target site and do things such as change passwords, disable Google Workspace notifications, dump emails, change SSH session keys in GitHub and download all code repositories,\u201d according to Proofpoint.Evilginx2 is a Golang kit, also originally created by a security researcher as a pen-testing tool.Its hallmarks are an easy setup and the ability to use its pre-installed \u201cphishlets,\u201d which are yaml configuration files the engine uses to configure the proxy to the target site. Users can also create new phishlets.\u201cUtilizing these phishlets, you can configure the server to phish multiple brands at once,\u201d according to Proofpoint. \u201cEvilginx2 allows you to configure a custom subdomain and landing page URL for each as well.\u201dOnce a victim clicks on the malicious link, they are taken to a secure page to log in, where the attackers lift the credentials, MFA codes and session cookies.\u201cThe victim is either redirected to a different page or allowed to continue through to the page,\u201d according to Proofpoint. \u201cThe threat actor is then able to use the stolen session cookie to log in as the victim where they can take multiple actions like changing the password, copying data or pretending to be the victim.\u201dWhile these tools aren\u2019t new, they\u2019re being increasingly used to bypass MFA, the firm noted, which is worrying given their lack of detection. Researchers from Stony Brook University and Palo Alto Networks developed a tool that managed to identify 1,200 MitM phishing sites. Yet, just 43.7 percent of those domains and 18.9 percent of their IP addresses showed up in VirusTotal \u2013 despite having lifespans of up to 20 or more days.\u201cAs more companies follow Google\u2019s lead and start requiring MFA, threat actors will rapidly move to solutions like these MitM kits,\u201d according to researchers. \u201cThey are easy to deploy, free to use and have proven effective at evading detection. The industry needs to prepare to deal with blind spots like these before they can evolve in new, unexpected directions.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.BreachMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The global pandemic has provided cover for all sorts of phishing scams over the past couple of years, and the rise in alarm over the spread of the latest COVID-19 variant, Omicron, is no exception.As public health professionals across the globe grapple with what they fear could be an even more dangerous COVID-19 variant than Delta, threat actors have grabbed the opportunity to turn uncertainty into cash.U.K. consumer watchdog \u201cWhich?\u201d has raised the alarm that a new phishing scam, doctored up to look like official communications from the National Health Service (NHS), is targeting people with fraud offers for free PCR tests for the COVID-19 Omicron variant.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization WHO) list Omicron as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d of the COVID-19 virus, and warned this week that it\u2019s spreading rapidly around the world. Public-health officials aren\u2019t sure yet how effective current vaccines and other mitigation strategies will be against the mutation, according to CBS News.Once again, global pandemic distress has presented an opportunity for scammers.Omicron Anxiety Fuels Scam Sent by text, email and even offered over the phone, threat actors are contacting people across the U.K. offering them what they say are new test kits specifically designed to detect the Omicron variant.\u201cNHS scientists have warned that the new Covid [sic] variant Omicron spreads rapidly, can be transmitted between fully vaccinated people, and makes jabs less effective,\u201d one phishing email discovered by Which? read. \u201cHowever, as the new covid [sic] variant (Omicron) has quickly become apparent, we have had to make new test kits as the new variant appears dormant in the original tests.\u201dBesides giving false information, the email is littered with grammatical errors. But, should a victim click on the link at the bottom of the correspondence, it takes the person to a fake NHS page that asks for full name, date of birth, address, phone numbers and email address.In addition to harvesting personally identifiable information (PII), the site also asks for a \u00a31.24 as a delivery fee and mother\u2019s maiden name, giving the scammers access to the target\u2019s banking information as well.This, and other pandemic-related phishing campaigns, rely on the victim\u2019s anxiety to cause them overlook obvious signs of fraud.\u201cPhishing attacks and other scams often exploit emotions to get people to react quickly and without thinking things through,\u201d Erich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, told Threatpost. \u201cThis new COVID-19 variant has some significant emotional weight for people who are tired of lockdowns and the continuing impact of the pandemic, making it a powerful tool to get people to click.\u201dThe watchdog has submitted its findings to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), but warned that other similar Omicron bait is likely to surface over the next several weeks \u2014 so consumers should be on alert.COVID-19 Phishing Frenzy Last year, when COVID-19 vaccines began rolling out, one analysis from Barracuda Networks found between October 2020 and last January, the average number of vaccine-themed spear phishing attacks grew by 26 percent.By May, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Department of Homeland Security shut down a scam site targeting immigrant communities with vaccine-related phishing scams.Besides vaccine lures, the pandemic has inspired spear-phishing campaigns offering fake COVID-19 relief checks and even job opportunities for those left unemployed by widespread shutdowns. Even people who held onto their jobs were targeted once they returned to work, with scam emails purporting to offer new office COVID-19 protocols. They instead stole their login credentials.Users should be cautious about almost any unsolicited communication relating to COVID-19. Anyone who received one of these scam Omicron PCR test emails is advised by Which? to forward it via report websites to the NCSC.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.\u00a0REGISTER TODAY\u00a0to learn key concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and how to use it to navigate the data ocean and add context to cybersecurity threats (without being an expert!).

        "raw text": "Even with the most sophisticated email scanning and phishing detection system available, phishing emails are still a very common intrusion vector for cybercriminals to use to introduce malware, including ransomware, to a business\u2019 network. That\u2019s because 1) increasingly, legitimate systems are used; and 2) phishing emails can also be effective even when employees are highly educated and are good at spotting and reporting them.Fortunately, there are tactics to protect your network even when the emails can\u2019t be stopped outright.Increasingly Effective PhishingWhen legitimate email systems are compromised and begin sending out malicious emails from a valid source, the efficacy of phishing is magnified. This was what happened over the weekend when one of the FBI\u2019s email systems was hacked to send out fake cybersecurity alerts to thousands of people.While the email that was sent out didn\u2019t appear to contain any phishing links, it does show that such email compromises can introduce significant security challenges for IT professionals. Most people who received the email would be unlikely to question its legitimacy\u2014even if they looked at the email headers\u2014because the email came from where it said it came from (in the above case, from the FBI).This type of compromise is extremely dangerous; it renders email authentication mechanisms like DMARC, SPF and DKIM useless since the email originates from an authorized source; so that means that anti-spam and anti-phishing software is much more unlikely to flag the message as malicious.Regardless of the actual damage done, the fact remains that such compromises enable malicious actors to execute very effective phishing attacks. So, if the email system has been compromised, what can organizations do to protect their networks from such attacks?Protecting the Network when Phishing Can\u2019t Be Stopped OutrightThere are many resources that network and security professionals should use to protect the business from major attacks. While it would be too exhaustive to list them all, let\u2019s explore a well-rounded, multi-layered approach to try to stop these attacks from gaining control of the network:Although email security is not infallible, as discussed above, there are some functions within email security that should be enabled so that the likelihood of infection from compromising emails is as low as possible.One of the most effective ways of stopping phishing attacks is to enable link-protecting in the corporate email settings. Such protections have the email system open any links and remove the ones that lead to malware downloads. Obviously, this protection can\u2019t defend against all nefarious links, but it certainly can help reduce the number of malicious links that make it through to inboxes.Setting higher spam-filter levels can also help block emails that have malicious intent. These settings use advanced heuristic modeling to look for poorly worded emails, or emails that have wording like other known malicious emails. Again, while not perfect, it\u2019s certainly an important first line of defense.Hopefully, all organizations already have firewalls in place to block well-known malware from making it onto the network; however, some don\u2019t have systems in place to block malware from spreading once it does enter. Intrusion detection and prevention systems enable organizations to find (detection) and eliminate/alter (prevention) the attack before it can take hold of other systems. These systems are often used as a coordinated effort with the endpoint protection (antivirus) that helps eliminate viruses and common malware.There is one caveat here: These systems, while very sophisticated, are not as effective at finding relatively new malware or malware that is effective at hiding for long periods of time. This is because the system looks at packets as they traverse the network and thus often misses malicious activity that moves across the network in sporadic time intervals over days or months. Thus, they, like advanced email security, should be included as part of a broader approach that includes other defenses.Another important prong of a multilayered approach is network detection and response (NDR), which security professionals can use to detect suspicious traffic, and analyze/block malware that makes it through other security systems.According to Gartner, NDR systems \u00a0work by applying \u201cmachine learning and other analytical techniques to network traffic\u201d and it \u201cis helping enterprises detect suspicious traffic that other security tools are missing.\u201d Behavioral, flow-based NDR tools complement signature-based detection solutions because they can detect anomalous behavior based on previously known network traffic.A Balanced ApproachThese three options, plus user education, endpoint detection and other best practices, can contribute to reducing the effectiveness of advanced phishing attacks. By deploying a multi-layered security approach, even when third-party systems are compromised, security teams are more effective at preventing malware from spreading across their network.Justin Jett is the director of audit and compliance at Plixer.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.InfoSec InsiderMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Secure email gateway (SEG) protections aren\u2019t necessarily enough to stop phishing emails from delivering ransomware to employees, especially if the cybercrooks are using legitimate cloud services to host malicious pages.Researchers are raising the alarm over a phishing email kicking off a Halloween-themed MICROP ransomware offensive, which they observed making its way to a target\u2019s inbox despite its being secured by an SEG.Infection RoutineThe original email purported to need support for a \u201cDWG following Supplies List,\u201d which is supposedly hyperlinked to a Google Drive URL. The URL is actually an infection link, which downloaded an .MHT file.\u201c.MHT file extensions are commonly used by web browsers as a webpage archive,\u201d Cofense researchers explained. \u201cAfter opening the file the target is presented with a blurred out and apparently stamped form, but the threat actor is using the .MHT file to reach out to the malware payload.\u201dThat payload comes in the form of a downloaded .RAR file, which in turn contains an .EXE file.\u201cThe executable is a DotNETLoader that uses VBS scripts to drop and run the MIRCOP ransomware in memory,\u201d according to the analysis.The campaign is not particularly sophisticated, but the use of Google Drive allowed it to get past SEGs.\u201cIts opening lure is business-themed, making use of a service \u2013 such as Google Drive \u2013 that enterprises employ for delivering files,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cThe rapid deployment from the MHT payload to final encryption shows that this group is not concerned with being sneaky. Since the delivery of this ransomware is so simple, it is especially worrying that this email found its way into the inbox of an environment using a SEG.\u201dThe recipient of this Halloween MICROP reported the email as suspicious, leading Cofense to discover the potential new threat.A Gory Theme, Unusual Use of Skype\u201cThe MIRCOP ransomware, also known as Crypt888 ransomware, encrypts users\u2019 files to hold them hostage,\u201d a Cofense analysts reported. \u201cAfter the payment demand is met, the threat actor promises to provide the decryption method. For this attack, the threat actor gives a set of instructions on the wallpaper.\u201dThe user is also unable to open any applications besides a few web browsers that can give them access to their email address which is used to contact the attacker,\u201d Cofense researchers wrote in a recent posting. \u201cThe email address is then used to set up the payment required to gain access to the decrypting tool the threat actor claims will unlock the files and applications.\u201dThey added, \u201cThe use of Skype as a medium to negotiate is uncommon, as most organized ransomware gangs have dedicated sites or mobile chat apps.\u201dWatch Locally Stored PasswordsThe other interesting aspect of this campaign is a\u00a0malicious file observed by the Cofense team, named \u201cPI2.exe.\u201d It steals passwords from web browsers including Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera, giving the threat actors both lateral access around the network, as well as an entry point for future attacks.\u201cLooking up the SHA256 hash of this executable on Virus Total, it can be linked to dozens of malicious executables going back to June of this year,\u201d researchers said.This \u201ctool\u201d indicates that the shift to working outside the office just further exposes business to these kinds of attacks, according to Miclain Keffeler, an application security consultant with nVisium, which is why local password management as well as reining in cloud permissions is increasingly imperative, he explained to Threatpost.\u201cCrypt888 seeks horizontal privilege escalation by stealing passwords that users may have saved locally \u2014 inevitably to be used in other ways that could wreak havoc on a business,\u201d Keffeler said. \u201cAs the cloud continues to grow, these saved passwords become a key attack vector as they can often grant large amounts of access \u2014 with little to no security controls.\u201dCybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "A recently discovered phishing scam tried to takeover more than 125 high-profile user accounts on TikTok. Researchers said the campaign marks one of the first major attacks on \u201cinfluencers\u201d found on the TikTok social-media platform.Researchers at cloud email security provider Abnormal Security detected the scams that attempted to take over people\u2019s accounts by sending emails impersonating TikTok and asking users to verify their log-in information.The campaign, tracked on Oct. 2 and Nov. 1, was sent to individuals worldwide. Each target had large-volume TikTok accounts \u201cof all kinds and across disparate locales,\u201d according to a Tuesday report authored by Abnormal Security.\u201cAmong the typical talent agencies and brand-consultant firms we would expect to see, this actor sent messages to social media production studios, influencer management firms, and content producers of all types,\u201d Rachelle Chouinard, a threat intelligence analyst at Abnormal Security, wrote in the report.Impersonation GameThe emails tried to dupe users into sending their log-in information to the threat actors in one of two ways, each of which required further action from the target. In both cases attackers pretended to be contacting users from TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance.One of the emails sent in the campaign informed the user that his or her account violated TikTok\u2019s copyright and asked the user to reply to the email to verify the account, threatening to remove the account in 48 hours if action was not taken.A second email falsely claiming to be sent by \u201cTikTok officials\u201d informed account holders that the account was eligible for a \u201cverified badge\u201d and asked them to reply to the email so the account could be properly verified.\u201cFrom well-known digital media channels to individual actors, models, and magicians, the campaign reached out to content creators worldwide,\u201d Chouinard wrote. \u201cSeveral emails were sent to the wrong company of the same name in the same country, and many of the email addresses used appear to have been lifted directly from social media.\u201dConnecting with AttackersResearchers turned the attackers\u2019 tactics back on them, impersonating influencers by responding to the phishing email, which garnered an email response containing shortened link titled \u201cConfirm My Account\u201d that directed researchers to a WhatsApp chat conversation, she explained.\u201cWithin the WhatsApp conversation, we were asked to verify the phone number and email address linked to the targeted TikTok account,\u201d Chouinard wrote.Next, the threat actor impersonating \u201cTikTok officials\u201d asked researchers to confirm their ownership of the account by providing the six-digit code they\u2019d sent, demonstrating how they bypass multi-factor authentication to take over the account.Communications with attackers ceased after that because attackers likely checked the TikTok account researchers used, which would show that \u201cour audience engagement was below par,\u201d Chouinard wrote. Abnormal Security tried to find an influencer who would permit use of his or her account for the experiment but did not succeed, she said.Motive UnclearThe campaign resulted in a number of those targeted having their accounts deleted or taken over and their data stolen, researchers reported. However, beyond this, researchers didn\u2019t see much of a clear motive for the campaign that would benefit attackers, Chouinard wrote.However, it\u2019s not uncommon for threat actors to target high-profile users of social media accounts\u2014more commonly people who are so-called \u201cinfluencers\u201d on Instagram and Facebook\u2013to extort money from account owners to get them back, she noted.\u201cPast targeting of social media accounts on other platforms offers several options,\u201d Chouinard wrote. \u201cSocial media accounts have become increasingly valuable in recent years, creating the incentive to ransom them back to the original owners for a hefty fee.\u201dInstagram users were indeed the target of a threat campaign from Turkish-speaking cybercriminals uncovered in August 2020. Attackers targeted hundreds of celebrities, startup business owners and others with sizeable followings on the platform in an attempt to steal both Instagram and email credentials.This type of activity has spurred \u201can underground economy\u201d offering ban-as-a-service, manipulating abuse reporting mechanisms to harass and censor other users, primarily on Instagram, Chouinard added.Want to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

        "raw text": "A new business email compromise (BEC) campaign targeting Microsoft 365 users is using a range of sophisticated obfuscation tactics within phishing emails that can fool natural language processing filters and are undetectable to end users.Researchers at Avanan, a CheckPoint company, first discovered the campaign \u2013 dubbed One Font because of the way it hides text in a one-point font size within messages \u2013 in September.Attackers also are hiding links within the cascading style sheets (CSS) in their phishing emails: another tactic that serves to confuse natural language filters like Microsoft\u2019s Natural Language Processing (NLP), researchers said in a report posted online Thursday.Register now for our LIVE event!The One Font campaign also includes messages with links coded within the <font> tag, which \u2013 in combination with the other obfuscation techniques \u2013 also destroy the effectiveness of email filters that depend on natural language for their analysis, according to Jeremy Fuchs, a cybersecurity researcher at Avanan.\u201cThis breaks semantic analysis, which leads many solutions to treat it as a marketing email, as opposed to phishing,\u201d Fuchs wrote. \u201cNatural language filters see random text; human readers see what the attackers want them to see.\u201dThe recent campaign is similar to one Avanan researchers discovered in 2018 called ZeroFont, which used similar tactics to get past Microsoft NLP in its Office 365 security protections. That campaign inserted hidden text with the font size of zero within messages to trip up email scanners that depend on natural language to weed out malicious emails.Like that campaign, One Font also targets Office 365 organizations and can lead to BEC and ultimately endanger the corporate network if the messages aren\u2019t flagged and users are duped into giving up their credentials, researchers said.Obfuscation SophisticationIndeed, since the ZeroFont campaign, cybercriminals have gotten increasingly sophisticated in their tactics to slip past the NLP used in common email filters, researchers said. Other techniques that Avanan researchers have observed include redirect tactics like meta refresh that can disrupt NLP and bypass Microsoft SafeLinks, they said.Once it makes it to inboxes appearing to be a legitimate message, the One Font campaign uses typical phishing social-engineering tactics to get people\u2019s attention. Attackers present what looks like a password-expiration notice, using urgent messaging to spur a potential victim into clicking on a malicious link.That link carries them to a phishing page where they appear to be entering their credentials so they can change their passwords. Instead, threat actors are stealing their credentials to use for other cybercriminal activity, researchers said.In their post, researchers demonstrated how specific phishing emails used a combination of tactics \u2013 specifically, links hidden within the CSS and links slipped within the <font> tag and then sized down to zero \u2013 that together confound natural language filters.Because such obfuscation techniques are invisible to the end user, flagging such messages as malicious can be tricky, Fuchs noted. To avoid these messages slipping past filters, researchers recommend that organizations use a multi-tiered security solution that combines advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as static layers like domain and sender reputation, he wrote.Using a security architecture that relies on more than one factor to block email and requiring corporate users to confirm with an IT department before engaging with any email that asks for a password change also can serve to mitigate attacks, Fuchs wrote.Image courtesy of Debora Cartagena, USCDCP.\u00a0Cybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "A surge in spearphishing emails designed to steal Office 365 credentials include some that were rigged to look like they came from major brands, including Kaspersky.According to a Kaspersky security bulletin posted Monday, two phishing kits identified as \u201cIamtheboss\u201d and \u201cMIRCBOOT\u2019 are being used together by multiple threat actors to send fake fax notifications.\u201cThe phishing e-mails are usually arriving in the form of \u2018fax notifications\u2019 and lure users to fake websites collecting credentials for Microsoft online services,\u201d according to the bulletin.One phishing campaign tracked by researchers appear to abuse an Amazon service called Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), designed to let developers send email messages from apps. The campaign, identified by Kaspersky, relied on a now-revoked stolen SES token used by a third-party contractor during the testing of the website 2050.earth.The 2050.earth site is a Kaspersky project that features an interactive map illustrating what futurologists predict to be the future impact of technology on the planet. The stolen SES token is tied to Kaspersky and SES because the 2050.earth site is hosted on the Amazon infrastructure.\u201cThese emails have various sender addresses, including but not limited to noreply@sm.kaspersky.com. They are sent from multiple websites including Amazon Web Services infrastructure,\u201d the security bulletin warned. The company said the stolen SES token was only abused in a limited capacity relative to an otherwise large-scale campaign abusing multiple brands.It\u2019s unclear what other brands are impacted by the ongoing campaigns and if other non-Kaspersky SES tokens are involved.The company said the SES token was immediately revoked when it was identified as being stolen and abused.The theft caused no damage, according to the advisory. \u201cNo server compromise, unauthorized database access or any other malicious activity was found at 2050.earth and associated services,\u201d it said.Amazon SES Token AbusePhishing is a common way for cybercriminals to dupe people through socially engineered emails into giving up their credentials to online accounts that can store sensitive data. Phishers use these emails \u2013 which sometimes fool people by impersonating a trusted company, application or institution \u2013 to direct people to specially crafted phishing sites so they can enter credentials, thinking they\u2019re doing so for a legitimate reason.Office 365 credentials are a common target for phishing attacks. In March, for example, a phishing scam targeted executives in the insurance and financial services industries with the aim of harvesting their Microsoft 365 credentials and launching business email compromise (BEC) attacks.Cybercrooks abusing the Amazon SES token are attempting to give their \u201cfax notifications\u201d an appearance of legitimacy by allowing them to identify the sender as \u201csm.kaspersky.com\u201d.The Lure: Phony FaxesThe phishing emails typically purport to be \u201cfax notifications\u201d that lure targets to fake websites that harvest credentials for Microsoft\u2019s online services. It\u2019s hardly the first time the old \u201cfax alert\u201d song and dance has been used. In December 2020, Office 365 credentials were likewise under attack by a campaign that used the same email con.One sample phishing email can be seen below.Sample of phishing email. Source: Kaspersky.Analysis showed that the phishing campaigns are relying on a phishing kit that Kaspersky researchers have named \u201cIamtheboss,\u201d used in conjunction with another phishing kit known as \u201cMIRCBOOT.\u201dMIRCBOOT Served Up By Turnkey Phishing Platform BulletProofLinkIf the name MIRCBOOT sounds familiar, it might be because it was one of the phishing kits that Microsoft recently found when it uncovered a large-scale, well-organized, sophisticated phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation that the criminals called BulletProofLink.BulletProofLink, a turnkey platform, provides phishing kits, email templates, hosting and other tools that let users customize campaigns and develop their own phishing ploys. They then use the PhaaS platform to help with phishing kits, email templates and the hosting services needed to launch attacks.MIRCBOOT and the other phishing kits available on BulletProofLink allow cybercriminal wannabes to set up the websites and purchase the domain names they need to launch phishing campaigns, pretending to be, say, employees of a security firm, as in this case.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.HacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "During the early days of the pandemic, while the rest of the world was stress streaming and working on sourdough starter, an ambitious teen stuck in his bedroom decided to set up a fake \u201cLove2Shop\u201d gift card site to harvest people\u2019s payment information, invest the stolen money in cryptocurrency and become a millionaire.The intrepid 17-year-old in the U.K. collected just under $9,000 before the real Love2Shop caught on when customers started to complain, according to a local report from Lincolnshire Live. The boy\u2019s name is being withheld because he\u2019s a juvenile.His age certainly didn\u2019t prohibit the scammer from being allowed to purchase Google ads to help lure people to his phishing scam site, according to prosecutors, ultimately ranking the scam phishing site over the legitimate one.In all, law enforcement said they found 12,000 credit card numbers and 197 PayPal accounts on his computer. They added that he had collected more than $440,000 in stolen money.\u201cHe had received through his PayPal accounts between January and March 2020 a total of \u00a3323,000,\u201d the case\u2019s prosecutor, Sam Skinner, said, according to Lincolnshire Live. \u201cThese sums came into his account and were transferred into cryptocurrency.\u201dGrift Cash Invested in CryptoTurns out not only did the teen set up a lucrative criminal enterprise, but he\u2019s also a wicked investor. His cryptocurrency investments were enormously profitable, ultimately climbing to more than $2.5 million.\u201cThe police found a large quantity of cryptocurrency,\u201d Skinner added, \u201cThere were 48 Bitcoins and a smaller number of other coins. At the time they were worth \u00a3200,000. They are now worth a little over \u00a32 million.\u201dThe teen was sentenced to a year in youth rehabilitation for fraud and money laundering. His Bitcoin was also confiscated.Cybersecurity Fundamentals A bored kid being able to pull off a heist of this size is a symptom of the wider cybersecurity community\u2019s lack of fidelity to fundamentals, according to John Bambenek, principal threat hunter with Netenrich.\u201cUltimately, 40 years on with Internet-connected technologies and we still can\u2019t resolve two basic problems: How can consumers verify that the websites they visit are legitimate? And, How can financial institutions validate transactions are legitimate?\u201d Bambenek told Threatpost. \u201cWe\u2019re failing so profoundly at the very basics that children can literally become millionaire criminals.\u201dAnd the blame so often placed on users for falling victims to cybercrime hasn\u2019t helped anyone but the attackers, as pointed out to Threatpost by Archie Agarwal, CEO of ThreatModeler. He added that companies with massive platforms like Google and PayPal have a responsibility to protect their platforms from being abused.Securing Massive Platforms from Abuse \u201cWith the prevalence of open-source tools that scrape and rebuild replica existing websites in minutes, this type of crime is very hard to prevent,\u201d Agarwal wrote. \u201cAnd we must not make the mistake of blaming the victims for clicking links on a system built on clicking links. It is the duty of the security community and the large Internet companies such as Google and PayPal, who were used in this scam, to find ways for alarms to trip to protect users as fast as possible.\u201dThreatpost asked Google directly about the U.K. teen\u2019s ability to use Google\u2019s advertising platform for criminal gain, and a spokesperson provided this response:\u201cOur goal is to create a safe and trustworthy experience for users. We take matters of ad fraud very seriously and continue to vigorously enforce our policies and be nimble when faced with new threats.\u201dGoogle\u2019s current ad policies prohibit brand impersonation, replicating original content and various other forms of misrepresentation scammers use to abuse Google\u2019s platform.When last March\u2019s Ads Safety Report was released, Google vice president Scott Spencer acknowledged that the pandemic and disinformation campaigns aimed at elections around the world have presented the company with a complicated set of challenges over the past year; but pledged to continue to invest in cybersecurity at scale.Spencer explained that it\u2019s just smart business: \u201cPreserving trust for advertisers and publishers helps their businesses succeed in the long term,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the upcoming year, we will continue to invest in policies, our team of experts and enforcement technology to stay ahead of potential threats.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.HacksWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Armorblox researchers have spotted an ongoing credential-phishing attack that spoofs an encrypted Zix email \u2013 one coming, weirdly enough, from what looks like a legitimate domain associated with the Baptist religion.At least, the threat actor is sending the phishing attack from \u201cthefullgospelbaptist[.]com\u201d: a domain that might be a deprecated or old version of a legitimate Baptist domain, fullgospelbaptist[.]org, which is a religious organization established in 1994.In a Tuesday post, researchers said that, to date, the fake-Zix encrypted email has targeted close to 75,000 inboxes and has slipped past embedded spam and security controls across Office 365, Google Workspace, Exchange, Cisco ESA and others.God isn\u2019t sending encrypted Zix messages: If hapless users click on the spoofed email\u2019s link, it will try to download a presumably unholy HTML file onto their system.The attack is targeting a range of companies across sectors including state and local government, education, financial services, healthcare, and energy, selectively going after a mix of senior executives and cross-departmental employees.In fact, Armorblox\u2019s research team found that the attacker is cherry-picking targets, being careful to select no more than one employee in any single department, probably to forestall the \u201cHey, did you get this weird email?\u201d chat among officemates.The Bogus Zix EmailZix is a key player in the email encryption market, right up there with Cisco Systems, Trend Micro, Proofpoint, Sophos and Norton LifeLock, et al.Building on the name recognition alone helps the email to pass a sniff test it should rightfully flunk. But beyond the brand name alone, the email attack also uses a \u201cgamut\u201d of additional techniques to evade traditional security filters and to \u201cpass the eye tests of unsuspecting end users,\u201d Armorblox explained, including social engineering, exploiting a legitimate-looking Baptist domain and replication of existing workflows.The subject header is \u201cSecure Zix message.\u201d The email body\u2019s header reiterates that title and tells the intended victim that they\u2019ve received a secure Zix message. Click on the \u201cMessage\u201d button to check it out, the email instructs.Credential-phishing email spoofing a Zix secure message. Source: Armorblox.Armorblox provided screenshots of both a genuine Zix secure message and the spoofed Zix secure message notification. As you can see below, the two interfaces aren\u2019t identical, but they\u2019re close enough to trick unsuspecting users.Email spoofing a Zix secure message notification. Source: Armorblox.Screenshot of a genuine Zix secure message template. Source: Armorblox.Satan Wants Select Employees to Click on \u2018Message\u2019Clicking on the \u201cMessage\u201d link in the email will trigger an attempted drive-by download of an HTML file named \u201csecuremessage.\u201d Armorblox researchers couldn\u2019t open that file in their virtual machine (VM) instance, since that\u2019s not where the redirect appeared. Fortunately, by the time researchers wrote up the attack, most site blockers were erecting a block page to prevent systems from getting infected.As far as the threat actor\u2019s preferred prey goes, Armorblox had a few examples: For example, one of the SLED (state and local government and education) businesses that Armorblox counts as customers experienced an attack wherein the targets included the CFO, a director of operations, a director of marketing and a professor.Another example: The credential phishers went after a wellness company, targeting the senior vice president of finance and operations, the president, and a utility email alias (member.services@company[.]com).Why such a seemingly random spread? The researchers theorized that the attackers might have deliberately chosen their victims \u201cto be across departments and to contain a good mix of senior leadership and individual contributors.\u201dAs well, the attackers may have gone after people who don\u2019t tend to turn to each other if they receive a suspicious email, Armorblox explained.Slippery TechniquesArmorblox summed up these techniques that the spoofed Zix email is using to evade traditional email security filters and watchful eyes:Social engineering: The email title, design, and content aimed to induce a sense of trust and urgency in the victims \u2013 a sense of trust because the email claimed to come from a legitimate company (Zix), and a sense of urgency because it claimed the victim was sent a secure message \u2013 something they would be eager to view. The context of this attack also leverages the curiosity effect, which is a cognitive bias that refers to our innate desire to resolve uncertainty and know more about something.It\u2019s easy to see how getting an email that somebody bothered to encrypt could pique recipients\u2019 curiosity. A May 2021 report from Security Advisor found that the curiosity effect \u2013 the desire to resolve uncertainty \u2013 has shown up as one of the top three cognitive biases to be exploited in phishing attacks, appearing in 17 percent of such attacks.Brand impersonation: The email has HTML stylings and content disclaimers similar to real emails from Zix. While not a perfect replica of the real thing, it bears enough resemblance to a legitimate email to be dangerous.Exploiting legitimate domain: The parent domain of the email sender was a deprecated or old version of a legitimate domain \u2013 \u2018thefullgospelbaptist[.]com\u2019. This helped the email bypass authentication checks.Armorblox researcher Abhishek Iyer told Threatpost on Monday that using legitimate (if unrelated) domains to send emails \u201cis more about tricking security controls (i.e. bypassing authentication checks) than it is about tricking recipients, especially if the domains are not spoofed to look like the real thing.\u201dAn example that Armorblox came across last year was a Verizon credential phishing campaign where the page was hosted on the website of a Wiccan coven. Another example: an Amazon credential phishing campaign where the email was sent from the domain of Blomma Flicka Flowers, a small floral design company based out of Vermont. The campaign aimed to lift credentials and other personal information under the guise of Amazon package-delivery notices.\u201cWhether these domains are used to send the email or host the phishing page, the attackers\u2019 intent is to evade security controls based on URL/link protection and get past filters that block known bad domains,\u201d Iyer said via email.Needless to say, the legitimate Baptist organization had nothing to do with the Zix campaign, he continued. \u201cTo host phishing pages on legitimate domains, attackers usually exploit vulnerabilities in the web server or the Content Management Systems (CMS) to host the pages without the website admins knowing about it.\u201dReplicating existing workflows: The context for the email attack replicates workflows that already exist in our daily work lives (getting encrypted email notifications). When we see emails we\u2019ve already seen before, our brains tend to employ System 1 thinking and take quick action. The email content even had every victim\u2019s first name filled in to increase the feeling of legitimacy and the chances of follow through.\u201cSystem 1 thinking\u201d is a reference to Daniel Kahneman\u2019s book, \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow,\u201d which delves into our brains\u2019 two information processing and decision making systems, System 1 being \u201cthe automatic, unconscious, and fast mode of thinking, offering little to no rationale behind its actions.\u201d System 2 thinking is what we need when we look into our inboxes: That\u2019s the \u201cslow, methodical, and analytical mode of thinking, skeptical and rational by default,\u201d Armorblox explained.\u201cSecurity awareness training programs require us to operate in the System 2 mode of thinking, encouraging us to be suspicious of emails we receive,\u201d Armorblox co-founder Arjun Sambamoorthy recommended in a post earlier this month.Phishing Is Getting Harder to SpotIn a recent column for Threatpost\u2019s InfoSec Insider series, Troy Gill, manager of security research at Zix, discussed the most common ways sensitive data is scooped up by nefarious sorts. His thoughts on how easy it is for any of us to fall for increasingly sophisticated phishing attempts such as the Zix spoofed email:\u201cEveryone wants to believe that they wouldn\u2019t fall victim to typical phishing scams. However, the truth is that these methods of intrusion are getting harder to spot as cybercriminals become more savvy with their tactics. Cybercriminals continue to build on trickier spear-phishing strategies that rely on brand-new techniques and even more deceitful tricks that can catch even the most discerning person unaware.\u201d \u2014Troy Gill, Threatpost InfoSec Insider column.How to Protect Your BusinessArmorblox provided this guidance and recommendations to keep the credential-phishers at bay: Augment native email security with additional controlsThe spoofed Zix email got past the security controls of Office 365, Google Workspace, Exchange, Cisco ESA and others. Armorblox recommended that for better protection coverage against email attacks, be they spear-phishing, business email compromise (BEC) or credential phishing attacks like this one, \u201corganizations should augment built-in email security with layers that take a materially different approach to threat detection.\u201dThe screenshot below shows the spoofed Zix email with a Spam Confidence Level (SCL) score of -1. As Microsoft outlines in its matrix of spam confidence level (SCL) in Exchange Online Protection, a rating of -1 means that the message skipped spam filtering and was delivered, since it was assumed to be \u201cfrom a safe sender, was sent to a safe recipient, or is from an email source server on the IP Allow List.\u201dThe email has an SCL score of -1, which means it skipped Microsoft\u2019s spam filters. Source: Armorblox. Watch out for social engineering cues\u201cSince we get so many emails from service providers, our brains have been trained to quickly execute on their requested actions. It\u2019s much easier said than done, but engage with these emails in a rational and methodical manner whenever possible,\u201d researchers recommended. \u201cSubject the email to an eye test that includes inspecting the sender name, sender email address, language within the email, and any logical inconsistencies within the email (e.g. Why is a Zix link leading to an HTML download? Why is the sender email domain from a third-party organization?).\u201d Follow MFA and password management best practices\u201cSince all workplace accounts are so closely interlinked, sharing credentials to one of your accounts can prove to be very dangerous as cybercriminals send emails in your name to trick your customers, partners, acquaintances, and family members,\u201d Armorblox said.Its specific recommendations:If you haven\u2019t already, implement these hygiene best practices:Deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all possible business and personal accounts.Don\u2019t use the same password on multiple sites/accounts.Use a password management software like LastPass or 1password to store your account passwords.Avoid using passwords that tie into your publicly available information (date of birth, anniversary date, etc.).Don\u2019t repeat passwords across accounts or use generic passwords such as \u2018password123\u2019, \u2018YourName123\u2019, etc.092821 14:27 UPDATE: Corrected misspellings of Armorblox.

        "raw text": "Microsoft uncovered a large-scale, well-organization and sophisticated phishing-as-a-service (PhaaS) operation. The turnkey platform allows users to customize campaigns and develop their own phishing ploys so they can then use the PhaaS platform to help with phishing kits, email templates and hosting services needed to launch attacks.Microsoft researchers discovered the operation, marketed by criminals as BulletProofLink, when they found a high volume of newly created and unique subdomains\u2014more than 300,000 in a single run, according to a post published by the Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team.\u201cThis investigation led us down a rabbit hole as we unearthed one of the operations that enabled the campaign,\u201d researchers wrote.\nWith more than 100 available phishing templates that mimic known brands and services\u2014including Microsoft itself\u2013the BulletProofLink operation is responsible for many of the phishing campaigns that impact enterprises today, they said.Phishing is a common way for cybercriminals to dupe people through socially-engineered emails into giving up their credentials to online accounts that can store sensitive data. Phishers use these emails\u2014which sometimes fool people by impersonating a trusted company, application or institution\u2013to direct people to specially crafted phishing sites so they can enter credentials, thinking they are doing so for a legitimate reasonPhishing is often a gateway drug into other criminal activity; phishers sell credentials obtained through campaigns on the dark web, and they can be used by ransomware gangs as an entry point into networks to deliver ransomware attacks, among other nefarious activity.Full-Scale Phishing FacilitatorBulletProofLink\u2014also known as BulletProftLink or Anthrax by its operators in various websites, ads and other promotional materials\u2013provides a starting point for people without significant resources to get into the phishing business.The group has been active since 2018 and maintains multiple sites under aliases. The group leverages services such as YouTube and Vimeo offering instructional videos, advertisements and promotional materials. It is known to hawk their wares on a plethora of underground forums, researchers said.While previously, criminals who wanted to launch these attacks had to build phishing emails and brand-impersonating websites on their own, \u201cthe phishing landscape has evolved its own service-based economy,\u201d researchers said. Now attackers can just purchase all the resources and other infrastructure they need to launch phishing attacks without investing a lot of time or effort, researchers said.There are two key offerings that are available to criminals who want to get into the phishing business: phish kits and phishing-as-a-service.The first are packaged files sold on a one-time basis that come with ready-to-use email phishing templates designed to evade detection and are often accompanied by a portal with which to access them, researchers explained. The kits\u2014an example of which is the MIRCBOOT phish kit\u2013allow people to set up the websites and purchase the domain names they need to launch phishing campaigns.The second offering is similar to ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), which also is a popular way cybercriminals can get into the game without making their own significant investment, researchers said.PhaaS\u2014the bread and butter of BulletProofLink\u2019s operation\u2013follows the software-as-a-service model, they said. Attackers pay an operator to develop turnkey phishing campaigns that include everything from false sign-in page development to website hosting to credential parsing and redistribution.Diving Deeper into PhaaSResearchers took a deeper dive into BulletProofLink\u2019s PhaaS operation to uncover how the group has created a flourishing network of phishers.Like any service provider, the group explains on an \u201cAbout Us\u201d page on its site the services it provides, including the sale of a \u201cunique scam page\u201d as well as a monthly hosted subscription service to set up a customer\u2019s phishing operation. In fact, the group hosts multiple sites to serve its customers, including an online store where customers can register, sign in and advertise their hosted service for monthly subscriptions.The monthly service costs as much as $800, while other services cost about $50 dollars for a one-time hosting link, researchers found, with Bitcoin being a common payment method on the BulletProofLink site. The organization even uses the typical service-provider tactic of offering a 10 percent welcome discount on customers\u2019 orders when they subscribe to its newsletter.An interesting point about the PhaaS working model BulletProofLink uses is that it follows the RaaS model\u2019s method of double extortion\u2014or in this case, \u201cdouble theft,\u201d as researchers describe.In ransomware, this method generally involves attackers exfiltrating and posting data publicly in addition to encrypting them on compromised devices to put pressure on organizations to pay the ransom, they noted.A similar workflow also is present in the economy of stolen credentials in BulletProofLink\u2019s PhaaS model, researchers wrote. The group includes a secondary location in its phishing kit for credentials to be sent once acquired, they observed.\u201cIn cases where the attackers using the service received credentials and logs at the end of a week instead of conducting campaigns themselves, the PhaaS operator maintained control of all credentials they resell,\u201d researchers wrote.In both RaaS and PhaaS, then, the operators supplying resources to facilitate attacks maximize monetization by assuring stolen data, access, and credentials are put to use in as many ways as possible. This also ensures that stolen credentials are likely to end up in the undergound economy, researchers observed.Rule #1 of Linux Security:\u00a0No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.\u00a0 JOIN\u00a0Threatpost and Linux security pros at Uptycs for a LIVE roundtable on the\u00a04 Golden Rules of Linux Security.

        "raw text": "Hackers are upping their game, using an approach I call \u201cDeep Sea Phishing,\u201d which is the use of a combination of the techniques described below to become more aggressive. To keep pace, cybersecurity innovators have been working diligently to develop tools, techniques and resources to improve defenses. But how can organizations fight against evolving threats that have yet to be launched\u2014or even conceived of?For example, in February, 10,000 Microsoft users were targeted in a phishing campaign which sent emails purporting to be from FedEx, DHL Express and other couriers which contained links to phishing pages hosted on legitimate domains, with the goal of obtaining recipients\u2019 work email credentials. Use of legitimate domains allowed the emails to evade security filters, and people\u2019s pandemic-related reliance on delivery services and habituation to similar messages boosted success rates.And in May, attackers launched a massive, sophisticated payment-themed phishing campaign. The phishing emails urged users to open an attached \u201cpayment advice\u201d \u2013 which was, in fact, not an attachment at all but rather an image containing a link to a malicious domain. When opened, Java-based STRRAT malware was downloaded onto the endpoint and via a command-and-control (C2) server connection, ran backdoor functions such as collecting passwords from browsers, running remote commands and PowerShell, logging keystrokes and other criminal activity.Phishing is no longer the basement-brewed, small-scale nuisance of cyber lore, either. Today, nearly 70 percent of cyberattacks \u2013 like like those cited above \u2013 are orchestrated by organized crime or nation-state affiliated actors. With many recovery tabs running into the millions, organizations need a solution that can safeguard them from attacks that have not yet been engineered \u2014 i.e., zero-day attacks that can cause the most damage.But before we tackle the issue of defense, let\u2019s first take a look at just what we\u2019re defending against. The types of phishing tactics noted below are listed in ascending order of sophistication.Types of PhishingNot all phishing attacks are created equal but all, by design, inflict damage on organizations that can involve significant financial payouts, remediation costs, revenue loss and damage to reputations. Attacks range from typical phishing emails to sophisticated spear-phishing schemes and \u201cwhaling.\u201dGarden-variety phishing succeeds as a numbers game. Phishers send out weaponized emails to a large list of recipients, with the well-founded expectation that some small percentage will click. Phishing emails are generally designed to appear to be official messages from trusted companies. However, when the recipient clicks on a seemingly innocuous link embedded within the email, malware may be downloaded straight onto their device, or a malicious webpage opens that either downloads malware or requests personal information like credentials, account numbers or other valuable data to be entered.Unlike phishing, which casts a wide net, spear-phishing emails are highly targeted, going after a specific individual or organization. Cybercriminals use social media and other public information to create personalized email for specific individuals and adopt the guise of a trusted sender.For instance, in April, personal information of 500 million LinkedIn accounts was scraped and leaked from the social-media platform and sold as bait for spear-phishing attacks. Because spear-phishing emails are personalized, recipients are more likely to click on a malicious link within and even enter credentials on a landing page.Whaling, which is a form of spear-phishing, targets prominent individuals like CEOs and CFOs to gain highly sensitive personal or business data. The \u201csender\u201d may pose as a business associate, customer or someone who has a critical business issue that needs to be addressed by the targeted individual. The primary goal of a whaling email is to steal sensitive business information.What sets spear-phishing and whaling apart from average phishing attacks is the use of personal and professional data that builds increased legitimacy in the eyes of the recipient. They are creative and effective forms of phishing that everyone needs to guard against.Cybercriminals are Ahead, Thanks to HumansMore sophisticated phishing attacks require more development time and effort \u2013 investment that is repaid in larger expected payouts, especially when layering on malware. These methods continue to work very well for the bad guys: In fact, according to a survey of MSPs worldwide, 67 percent of respondents indicated that phishing emails were the most common delivery channel for ransomware attacks.This is alarming, given that many companies require employees to periodically undergo anti-phishing training. But alas, not surprising. Employee training falls short of protecting organizations because humans are the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. Gullible, habit-driven creatures that we are, we continue to click on links that compromise organizations\u2019 entire networks.Verizon\u2019s 2021 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) top finding states that 85 percent of breaches involved a human element, 36 percent involved phishing (11 percent more than the previous year), and 10 percent of breaches involved ransomware \u2013 double the rate of the previous year.The Ransomware-Phishing LinkOrganizations of all sizes should be considering what a ransomware attack \u2013 which often starts with phishing \u2013 could do to their performance, financial stability and future. More importantly, they should be assessing their cybersecurity strategies and security architecture, especially in light of the disappearing perimeter associated with increasingly distributed workforces.According to SonicWall, ransomware attacks increased by 62 percent since 2019.This onslaught includes small businesses. An estimated half of all cyberattacks target this group, which may not have the same phishing awareness training in place as larger organizations. The resulting revenue loss and costs of remediation, downtime, reputational damage and legal expenses are all big hits for small businesses.New developments make ransomware even more of a threat. According to the FBI, Ryuk is the top ransomware in terms of payments completed. Now, a worm-like capability has been added, which makes it no longer reliant on human clicks to spread. This is a significant and very worrisome development.Consider this: An initial infection occurs within just a few seconds. Ransomware that is launched when a user clicks a link in a phishing email rapidly begins to spread laterally throughout the network, encrypting PCs and servers for maximum damage \u2013 and maximum profit for the cybercriminals targeting your organization.The ransomware then reads infected files, in search of user credentials that will enable it to spread faster via remote desktop connections between network computers or mapped drives. Backing up data on a cloud, while good practice, may not necessarily be sufficient.Sophisticated strains of ransomware can target files on shared network drives and cloud backup services, thus paralyzing your entire organization and leaving you at the (dubious) mercy of cybercriminals.The impact of ransomware may also extend well beyond the business itself. For instance, the May ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline\u2014a 900-person company\u2014shut down 5,500 miles of pipeline that carry 45 percent of the U.S. East Coast\u2019s fuel supplies. The company paid the $4.4 million ransom, largely due to pressure to restore service for the tens of millions of people and organizations that depend on the pipeline for fuel, including medical services, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, airports and the public at large.An email just needs to hit at one vulnerable moment, with a lure that resonates with one employee who receives it, for that individual to click on a seemingly legitimate link in a phishing email to download an infected file. With today\u2019s zero-day threats and advanced malware, stronger defenses than signature-based scanning techniques and lookups for known malicious domains are needed \u2013 and needed now.Organizations cannot depend on their users as a last line of defense against phishing. After all, user vulnerability is why phishing is so effective and so widely used. Don\u2019t fault your employees: Cybercriminals are among the most sophisticated experts in human behavior as well as in exploiting technologies that allow their efforts to remain undetected.Defense Options: Remote Browser IsolationFor these reasons and more, a very different approach must be considered\u2014one that assumes breach yet prevents exposure to malware and ransomware. And with phishing attacks becoming more layered and multifaceted, it\u2019s hard to tell what the next cybercrime innovation will be, so future-proofing becomes important.Remote browser isolation (RBI) provides organizations with a defense against even the most sophisticated web-based attacks. When a user clicks a link in an email or opens a new browser tab, RBI executes the web content in a virtual browser located in a remote, isolated container in the cloud. Only safe rendering data is sent to the user\u2019s regular endpoint browser, providing a fully interactive, regular browsing experience. No web content reaches the user device, and potentially risky sites can be opened in read-only mode to prevent credential theft, so users are 100 percent protected from malware from malicious websites and URLs in phishing emails.Phishing is not only here to stay, but it is getting more advanced and dangerous each day. Accepting that humans are fallible and easily manipulated is essential, so that organizations stop relying primarily on training and opt for solutions that effectively protect the organizations from the cybercriminals\u2019 best efforts, as well as from their own users\u2019 errors. Using RBI to isolate users and \u201cair gap\u201d them from the dangers of malicious email links and phishing sites is an innovative approach that organizations can adopt today to keep themselves out of the phishing and ransomware headlines.Nick Kael is CTO at Ericom.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by\u00a0visiting our microsite.InfoSec InsiderMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Threat actors impersonated the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) in a two-day phishing campaign that used a combination of tactics \u2013 including creating new domains that mimic federal sites so as to appear to be legitimate \u2013 to evade security detections.Between Aug. 16-18, researchers at e-mail security provider INKY detected 41 phishing emails dangling the lure of bidding for projects benefitting from a $1 trillion infrastructure package recently passed by Congress, according to a report written by INKY\u2019s Roger Kay, vice president of security strategy, that was published on Wednesday.The campaign \u2013 which targeted companies in industries such as engineering, energy and architecture that likely would work with the USDOT \u2013 sends potential victims an initial email in which they\u2019re told that the USDOT is inviting them to submit a bid for a department project by clicking a big blue button with the words \u201cClick Here to Bid.\u201dThe emails themselves are launched from a domain, transportationgov[.]net, that was registered by Amazon on Aug. 16, Kay said. The date of its creation \u2013 revealed by WHOIS \u2013 seems to signal that the site was set up specifically for the phishing campaign.To anyone familiar with government sites, the domain would appear suspicious given that government sites typically have a .gov suffix. However, \u201cto someone reading through quickly, the domain name might seem at least somewhere in the ballpark of reality,\u201d Kay observed.Fooling TargetsIf people take the bait and click, they are led to a site, transportation.gov.bidprocure.secure.akjackpot[.]com, \u201cwith reassuring-sounding subdomains like \u2018transportation,\u2019 \u2018gov,\u2019 and \u2018secure,'\u201d Kay wrote. However, the base domain of the site, akjackpot[.]com, was actually registered in 2019 and \u201chosts what may or may not be an online casino that appears to cater to Malaysians,\u201d he wrote.\u201cEither the site was hijacked, or the site owners are themselves the phishers who used it to impersonate the USDOT,\u201d Kay noted.Once on the fake bidding site, targets are then instructed to click on a \u201cBid\u201d button and sign in with their email provider to connect to \u201cthe network.\u201d It also instructed them to contact a fictitious person at another fake domain \u2013 specifically, mike.reynolds@transportationgov[.]us \u2013 with any questions.Once victims closed the instructions, they were directed to an identical copy of the real USDOT website that the attackers created by copying HTML and CSS from the government\u2019s site onto their phishing site.In a twist, threat actors also copied and pasted in a real warning about how to verify actual U.S. government sites, which could alert savvy victims that they were being scammed by realizing that the phishing site domain ended in .com rather than .gov or .mil, Kay noted.Once on the imposter USDOT site, targets are invited to click a red \u201cClick Here to Bid\u201d button that brings up a credential-harvesting form with a Microsoft logo and instructions to \u201cLogin with your email provider.\u201d A first attempt to enter credentials is met with a ReCAPTCHA challenge \u2013 often used by legitimate sites as an extra security device. However, attackers already captured credentials by this point, Kay noted.If targets make a second attempt to enter credentials, a fake error message appears, after which they are directed to the real USDOT website \u2013 \u201can elegant but perhaps unnecessary flourish that phishers often execute as the final step of their sequence,\u201d Kay wrote.Evading DetectionThough attackers didn\u2019t use any particular new phishing tricks in their campaign, it was the combination of tactics in a new pattern that allowed them to get the emails through secure email gateways, Kay said.\u201cBy creating a new domain, exploiting current events, impersonating a known brand, and launching a credential-harvesting operation, the phishers came up with an attack just different enough from known strikes to evade standard detection methods,\u201d he wrote.Using newly created domains in particular allowed the phishing mails to slip through standard email authentication, i.e., SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, he observed.\u201cSince they were brand new, the domains represented zero-day vulnerabilities; they had never been seen before and did not appear in threat intelligence feeds commonly referenced by legacy anti-phishing tools,\u201d Kay wrote. \u201cWithout a blemish, these sites did not look malicious.\u201dIt\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

        "raw text": "Research shows that the cost of phishing attacks has nearly quadrupled over the past six years: Large U.S. companies are now losing, on average, $14.8 million annually, or $1,500 per employee.That\u2019s up sharply from 2015\u2019s figure of $3.8 million, according to a new study from Ponemon Institute that was sponsored by Proofpoint.According to the study, released Tuesday, phishing leads to some of the costliest cyberattacks.\nOne of the most expensive threat types is business email compromise (BEC). BEC costs ramped up significantly in 2020, with more than $1.8 billion stolen from organizations as cybercrooks launch ever slicker attacks, either impersonating someone inside an organization or masquerading as a partner or vendor in order to pull off financial scams.One of the other most expensive attacks is ransomware, as experts have tracked skyrocketing ransom costs.But what businesses shell out for extortion payments in ransomware attacks or what gets jimmied out of them in fraudulent BEC wire transfers are both just portions of the true costs of phishing attacks, according to the study, titled The 2021 Cost of Phishing.\u201cWhen people learn that an organization paid millions to resolve a ransomware issue, they assume that fixing it cost the company just the ransom. What we found is that ransoms alone account for less than 20 percent of the cost of a ransomware attack,\u201d said Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of Ponemon Institute, in a press release. \u201cBecause phishing attacks increase the likelihood of a data breach and business disruption, most of the costs incurred by companies come from lost productivity and remediation of the issue rather than the actual ransom paid to the attackers.\u201dLost Productivity is the Biggest GotchaIt\u2019s the lost productivity and mopping up that eat up the lion\u2019s share of the costs of phishing attacks, with a host of other investigative and compliance costs in the mix. Below is a table that summarizes the annual hours incurred for six tasks by the average-sized organization on an annual basis. As it depicts, the most time-consuming tasks to resolve phishing scams are the cleaning and fixing of infected systems and conducting forensic investigations.Phishing cost components. Source: Ponemon Institute.Phishing cost categories distribution. Source: Ponemon.The study found that in an average-sized U.S. corporation of 9,567 people, that lost productivity translates to 63,343 wasted hours every year. Each employee wastes an average of 7 hours annually due to phishing scams: an increase from 4 hours in 2015.Estimated hours per employee each year spent dealing with phishing scams. Source: Ponemon Institute.The study, initially conducted in 2015, surveyed nearly 600 IT and IT security practitioners.Researchers found that the average annual cost of phishing has increased from $3.8 million in 2015 to $14.83 million in 2021. As the table shows, productivity losses have spiked, from $1.8 million in FY2015 to $3.2 million in FY2021. (Information about BEC and ransomware wasn\u2019t available in FY2015.) In this, the most current study, annual cost of phishing for BEC was estimated to be $5.97 million, while average ransomware costs were estimated to total $996,000.The BEC BluesSome of the study\u2019s key takeaways:BEC costs nearly $6 million annually for a large organization. Of that, illicit payments made annually to BEC attackers is $1.17 million.Ransomware annually costs large organizations $5.66 million. Of that, only $790,000 accounts for the paid ransoms themselves.Security awareness training reduces phishing expenses by more than 50 percent on average.Costs for resolving malware infections have more than doubled since 2015. The average total cost to resolve malware attacks is $807,506 in 2021, an increase from $338,098 in 2015.Credential compromise costs have increased dramatically since 2015. As a result, organizations are spending more to respond. The average cost to contain phishing-based credential compromises increased from $381,920 in 2015 to $692,531 in 2021. Organizations experienced an average of 5.3 compromises over a 12-month period.Business leaders should pay attention to probable maximum loss scenarios. For instance, BEC attacks could incur losses from business disruptions of up to $157 million if organizations aren\u2019t prepared. Malware resulting in data exfiltration could cost businesses up to $137 million.Ryan Kalember, executive vice president of cybersecurity strategy for Proofpoint, said in a release that the cost of credential compromise has \u201cexploded\u201d in recent years due to threat actors targeting employees instead of networks. It leaves the door \u201cwide-open for much more devastating attacks like BEC and ransomware,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil organizations deploy a people-centric approach to cybersecurity that includes security awareness training and integrated threat protection to stop and remediate threats, phishing attacks will continue.\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Cyberattackers are using Google\u2019s reCAPTCHA (aka the \u201cI am not a robot\u201d function) and fake CAPTCHA-like services to obscure various phishing and other campaigns, according to researchers. There are signs however that those evasion efforts may be losing their efficacy.CAPTCHAs are familiar to most internet users as the challenges that are used to confirm that they\u2019re human. The Turing test-ish puzzles usually involve clicking all photos in a grid that contain a certain object, or typing in a word presented as blurred or distorted text.The idea is to weed out bots on eCommerce and online account sites \u2013 and they serve the same purpose for crooks.\u201cHiding phishing content behind CAPTCHAs prevents security crawlers from detecting malicious content and adds a legitimate look to phishing login pages,\u201d according to a Friday writeup from Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42.Though it\u2019s far from new, it\u2019s an increasingly popular technique: Just in the last month, the firm found 7,572 unique malicious URLs over 4,088 pay-level domains employing the obfuscation method. That\u2019s an average of 529 new CAPTCHA-protected malicious URLs per day.Beyond Phishing: New Categories of Malicious URLs Besides the endless litany of phishing campaigns, scam campaigns and malicious gateways using CAPTCHA evasion are on the rise, according to Unit 42.\u201cSurvey and lottery scams are some of the most common grayware pages,\u201d according to the posting. \u201cIn exchange for a fake payment or chance at winning the lottery, the user is lured into disclosing sensitive information, including address, date of birth, banking information, annual income, etc.\u201dOften, these pages show CAPTCHA challenges only if they suspect automation based on IP and browser versions, researchers said \u2013 so as to make it as easy as possible to sucker visitors.Another growing category is malware delivery pages abusing legitimate CAPTCHA services.\u201cFor example, the URL hxxps://davidemoscato[.]com serves a malicious JAR file that is hidden from security scanners by protecting the page with a CAPTCHA challenge,\u201d researchers noted.How to Find CAPTCHA-Protected Malicious SitesThe good news is that Unit 42 researchers said that it\u2019s possible to detect phishing pages through the association of CAPTCHA keys.The page housing the CAPTCHA will have sub-requests that can be parsed in the HTML, which reveal the reCAPTCHA API key used in the URL parameters, researchers said. Such identifiers can be parsed out and searched for on other pages.\u201cWe see many malicious campaigns reuse CAPTCHA service keys, either to simplify their malware infrastructure or to avoid being blocked by the legitimate reCAPTCHA provider for creating too many CAPTCHA accounts and keys,\u201d they explained.For example, in one case a webpage targeting Microsoft credentials using the same key as a separate URL used for Apple ID phishing, according to the report.\u201cMass phishing and grayware campaigns have become more sophisticated, using evasion techniques to escape detection by automated security crawlers,\u201d researchers concluded. \u201cFortunately, when malicious actors use infrastructure, services or tools across their ecosystem of malicious websites, we have a chance to leverage these indicators against them. CAPTCHA identifiers are one great example of such detection by association.\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Threat actors are using compromised WordPress websites to target manufacturers across Asia with a new spear-phishing campaign that delivers the Warzone RAT, a commodity infostealer available widely for purchase on criminal forums, researchers have found.The threat group Aggah, believed to be affiliated with Pakistan and first identified in March 2019, is delivering the RAT in a campaign aimed at spreading malware to manufacturing companies in Taiwan and South Korea, according to new research from threat detection and response security firm Anomali.The campaign, which began in early July, uses spoofed email addresses appearing to originate with legitimate customers of the manufacturers, signaling that it was the work of Aggah, researchers noted.\n\u201cSpoofed business-to-business (B2B) email addresses against the targeted industry is activity consistent with Aggah,\u201d Tara Gould and Rory Gould from Anomali Threat Research wrote in a report on the campaign published Thursday.Researchers from Palo Alto Network\u2019s Unit 42 first discovered Aggah in March 2019 in a campaign targeting entities in the United Arab Emirates that later was identified as a global phishing campaign designed to deliver RevengeRAT, researchers said.The group, which typically aims to steal data from targets, was first thought to be associated with Gorgon Group: a Pakistani group known for targeting Western governments. This association has not been proven, but researchers tend to agree that the Urdu-speaking group originated in Pakistan, according to Anomali.Among the targets of Aggah\u2019s latest campaign were Fon-star International Technology, a Taiwan-based manufacturing company; FomoTech, a Taiwanese engineering company; and Hyundai Electric, a Korean power company.Threat actors often target global manufacturers and other suppliers not only to target them, but also as a way to infiltrate some of their more high-profile customers. An example of this was seen in April when the now-defunct REvil gang successfully deployed ransomware against Quanta, a Taiwanese supplier of Apple Computer, just ahead of a big Apple product launch event.REvil stole files from Quanta that included blueprints for some of Apple\u2019s new products. The operators threatened to release more and to spill the beans on new products in order to pressure the company to pay up ahead of Apple\u2019s Spring Loaded event.Exploiting Compromised WordPress SitesThe latest Aggah spear-phishing campaign begins with a custom email masquerading as \u201cFoodHub.co.uk,\u201d an online food delivery service based in the United Kingdom, researchers said.The email body includes order and shipping information as well as an attached PowerPoint file named \u201cPurchase order 4500061977,pdf.ppam\u201d that contains obfuscated macros that use mshta.exe to execute JavaScript from a known compromised website, mail.hoteloscar.in/images/5[.]html, researchers explained.\u201cHoteloscar.in is the legitimate website for a hotel in India that has been compromised to host malicious scripts,\u201d they said. \u201cThroughout this campaign, we observed legitimate websites being used to host the malicious scripts, most of which appeared to be WordPress sites, indicating the group may have exploited a WordPress vulnerability.\u201dThe JavaScript uses anti-debugging techniques such as setInterval to detect the use of a debugger based on the execution time, researchers noted. This sends setInterval into an infinite loop if a debugger is detected. After the debugging checks, the script returned http://dlsc.af/wp-admin/buy/5[.]html, another compromised website for a food distributor based in Afghanistan.Eventually, the Javascript uses PowerShell to load hex-encoded payloads, with the ultimate payload being the Warzone RAT, a C++-based malware available for purchase on the dark web, researchers said.\u201cWarzone is a commodity malware, with cracked versions hosted on GitHub,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe RAT reuses code from the Ave Maria stealer.\u201d Capabilities of the Warzone RAT include privilege escalation, keylogging; remote shell, downloading and executing files, file manager, and persistence on the network, researchers noted.\u201cTo bypass User Account Control (UAC), the Windows Defender path was added to a PowerShell command to exclude it,\u201d they explained. \u201cPrivilege escalation in Warzone was carried out using sdclt.exe, a Windows backup utility in Windows 10.\u201dThe Anomali team noted a number of tactics used in the campaign that are evidence of Aggah\u2019s handiwork. These include the use of malicious documents and malicious PowerPoint files containing macros; obfuscated payloads in a PowerShell file, typically hex-encoded; use of scripts embedded in websites; themes of order and payment information; and the aforementioned use of spoofed B2B email addresses within the target industry.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Attackers are using spoofed sender addresses and Microsoft SharePoint lures in a new phishing campaign that is \u201csneakier than usual\u201d and can slip through the usual security protections in its aim to fool people into giving up their credentials, Microsoft researchers discovered.Microsoft Security Intelligence researchers discovered the campaign targeting organizations that use Microsoft Office 365 by using the file-sharing aspect of SharePoint, they revealed in a tweet on Tuesday.The campaign spoofs display sender addresses that contain the target usernames and domains, as well as display names \u201cthat mimic legitimate services to try and slip through email filters,\u201d researchers said.Attackers send emails that \u201cuse a Sharepoint lure in the display name as well as the message,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThis campaign is active with various lure themes,\u201d they tweeted.The email alerts a recipient to a file-share request from someone who appears to be a colleague that they may have missed and includes a link to a phishing page. To appear authentic, the file is said to contain some type of legitimate business content, such as staff reports, bonuses or price books, researchers noted.If a user takes the bait, he or she is eventually directed to a phishing page that requires them to sign into Office 365 with their legitimate credentials, Microsoft said.Given its widespread use among many enterprise and business customers, the SharePoint collaboration platform is a popular target for threat actors.In particular, its file-sharing capability, combined with spoofing, is a particularly effective way to trick victims into revealing credentials, observed Dora Tudor, a cyber security enthusiast with Heimdal Security.\u201cWhen it comes to email spoofing you might think that if the received email came from a trusted entity you can rely on it to be safe but, unfortunately, any links existing in the email may end up infecting you with malware,\u201d she noted in a blog post Tuesday.Suspicious SignsDespite the overall craftiness of this latest campaign, there are some telltale signs that something is amiss, according to Microsoft.For one, the original sender addresses, which use variations of the word \u201creferral,\u201d also use various top-level domains, including the domain com[.]com, which is popularly used by phishing campaigns for spoofing and typosquatting, they noted on Twitter.Other clues to the malicious intent of the campaign are found in its use of URLs that lead potential victims to the phishing page for entering their credentials, according to researchers.Attackers use two URLs with malformed HTTP headers, they said. The primary phishing URL is a Google storage resource that directs to an AppSpot domain requiring the user to sign in \u201cbefore finally serving another Google User Content domain with an Office 365 phishing page,\u201d researchers said.The second URL used in the campaign is found within the notification settings. This one leads to a compromised SharePoint site \u201cthat the attackers use to add legitimacy to the attack,\u201d according to Microsoft.Both URLs require potential victims to sign in to move on to the final page, \u201cbypassing many sandboxes\u201d on the way, researchers said.Researchers provided a query string on GitHub that can be run through Microsoft 365 Defender to flag any emails from the campaign that may have slipped past other gateways, they said.Worried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Customers who signed up for emails from fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill were recently faced with bigger challenges than queso versus sour cream. A breach of the restaurant\u2019s email marketing service last month lead to customers being served phishing lures and malicious links that redirected to credential harvesting sites.Researchers at Inky reported that Chipotle\u2019s email vendor Mailgun was breached, allowing threat actors to commandeer the company\u2019s email marketing efforts.Mailgun has not responded to Threatpost\u2019s request for comment.The Inky report, posted Friday, found 121 phishing emails sent from the compromised Chipotle Mailgun account sent between July 13 and July 16. Those attacks included two vishing attacks (using malicious voicemail message attachments), 14 impersonated USAA bank to harvest financial data and the remaining 105 emails attempted to redirect users to a spoofed Microsoft site that attempted to steal credentials.TTPs Eerily Similar to Nobelium The attacks leveraging Chipotle\u2019s breached Mailgun account are similar to Nobelium\u2019s attack on email marketing service in May 2021. That\u2019s when the group breached Constant Contact\u2018s systems and took over the account of USAID, an international development agency.\u201cInky has no evidence to suggest the same actors are involved in these attacks, it appears to be a case of copying a successful attack vector used by Nobelium,\u201d the report said. \u201cInky continues to investigate these attacks.\u201dNobelium has been credited with the SolarWinds attack on the U.S. government.By late June Nobelium was reported by the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center to be behind brute force and password-spray attacks on Microsoft corporate networks as part of ongoing efforts to gain a foothold in U.S. tech and government agencies.In fact, 45 percent of all phishing attacks in 2020 were aimed at swiping Microsoft credentials, according to a report released early this year by Cofense.Microsoft continues to be a prime target for phishing attacks because the credentials are highly valuable, Inky explained.\u201cAlmost everyone has a Microsoft account, and logins there can lead to all kinds of interesting data, including other logins, trade secrets, financial details, and other intelligence,\u201d Inky said. \u201cThus, it is not surprising that INKY identified 105 phishing emails during that three-day stretch all of which had mail.company[.]com links that redirected the recipient to a malicious Microsoft credential-harvesting site.\u00a0\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Malicious Android apps disguised as TikTok and offers for free Lenovo laptops are being used in ad-stuffing attacks underway against devices on the Jio telecom network in India, security researchers warn.Researchers from Zscaler report this threat actor has been operating various phishing scams since March 2020, all using recent headlines as lures.Their most recent socially engineered messages try to convince users to download their fake version of TikTok by saying the app, which is banned in India, is now available, the report found. Another scam misleads victims into thinking they\u2019re eligible for a free Lenovo laptop courtesy of the Indian government.The Jio User Attack \u201cThe malware involved has features that are also commonly found in other families as well, e.g. it follows common methods of persistence, and propagation using victim\u2019s contact information,\u201d Deepen Desai, Zscaler CISO, told Threatpost. \u201cThe attack campaign is fairly targeted and leverages trusted resources like Weebly\u00a0and\u00a0GitHub\u00a0for distributing the malicious content to the victims.\u201dTargeted but widespread: Jio telecom serves more than half of India\u2019s internet subscribers, which according to a March 2020 report from the Indian Telecom Regulatory Authority topped 743 million people.He added that the Zscaler team observed more than 200 malicious Android apps using \u201cthemes related to current affairs in India.\u201dVictims are told to share the fake TikTok app via WhatsApp \u2013 once it\u2019s shared 10 times, the ads start. Source: ZscalerThreat actors blast out an SMS or WhatsApp message to numbers on the Jio network with the phishing lure message and a link to take advantage of the fraudulent offer, the report showed. The link leads to a Weebly-hosted site controlled by the cybercriminals, it explained.\u201cIn the original download request which we observed in Zscaler cloud, the user-agent string was: WhatsApp/2.21.4.22 which indicated to us that the link was clicked by the user in a WhatsApp message,\u201d according to the analysis.The report added additional examples of the URLs:Website: https://tiktokplus[.]weebly.com/Shortened link:\u00a0http://tiny[.]cc/Tiktok_pro\nURL:\u00a0https://tiktokplus[.]weebly.com/\nGitHub download link:\u00a0https://github.com/breakingnewsindia/t1/raw/main/Tiktik-h[dot]apkOnce the target is on the malicious site, the attacker attempts to get the user to download an Android package (APK) file.In the case of the Lenovo-themed attack, the APK calls datalaile.class, which first checks if it has permissions, if not, a message displays that says, \u201cNeed Permission to start app!!\u201d the report said. Once permissions are granted, a form asking for a username and password is displayed.The next step in the chain is for the attackers to try and spread the malware as far and wide as possible. In the TikTok attack example, the malware prompts the victim to share the malicious link on WhatsApp 10 times.\u201cThere is no check to identify if WhatsApp is installed or not,\u201d the researchers said. \u201cIn case WhatsApp is not installed, a Toast message is shown reading \u2018WhatsApp not installed,\u2019 but the counter still decrements.\u201dOnce the message is shared with 10 others, the congratulations message is delivered, which when clicked calls clickendra.class which displays ads, ending with a final message that \u201cTikTok will start in 1 hour.\u201dThe Ad-Stuffer Malware\u201cThese apps are used by the threat actor to generate revenue by displaying interstitial advertisements to the user,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere are two software development kits (SDKs) used for this purpose. If it fails to retrieve advertisements using one SDK, then it uses the next SDK as a fail-over mechanism.\u201dThey added that the two SDKs observed in the app were AppLovin and StartApp.\u201cBefore displaying the ads, a fake view is created for the user which contains a fake text message and a fake progress bar on top of all the elements,\u201d the report added. \u201cAfter setting the fake view, a request to fetch the ads is sent. If the ad is received successfully, then it is displayed and the fake progress bar is hidden, else a request to load the next ad is sent.\u201dIf the ads fail to load, the Zscaler team observed, the ad-stuffer malware calls lastactivity.class to display a message to the victim, asking them to \u201cClick on ad and install app to continue.\u201d\u201cIt changes the content view, initializes the StartApp SDK again and creates a fake progress bar as earlier,\u201d the report said. \u201cIf the ad is received, then it is displayed to the user.\u201dThe Malware Spreader The code used to propagate the bug is felavo.class, which the researchers said performs two key functions: Initialization and spreading the malicious link through SMS texts, which are sent only to other Jio customers.\u201cThe decoy message used to spread the application is stored in encrypted form,\u201d the report explained. \u201cIn the initialization phase, the service configures the cryptographic context, which is later used to decrypt the decoy message.\u201dThe malware looks through the victim\u2019s contact list to find other Jio-associated numbers by fetching a list of contacts, organizing them and creating a clean list, the team found.Zscaler said it will continue to monitor the threat actors, but users need to be aware these threats are out there and take precautions to protect themselves, Desai added.\u201cAlways rely on trusted app store like Google Play when downloading any applications,\u201d he advised. \u201cDo not download apps from unsolicited messages even if they arrive from your trusted contacts.\u201dEver wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums?

        "raw text": "Apple accidentally approved one of the most popular Mac malware threats \u2013 OSX.Shlayer \u2013 as part of its security notarization process.The Apple notary service is an automated system on recent macOS versions that scans software (ranging from macOS apps, kernel extensions, disk images and installer packages) for malicious content and checks for code-signing issues. Then, when a macOS user installs the software, Apple\u2019s Gatekeeper security feature notifies them about whether any malicious code was detected before they open it.Security researchers Peter Dantini and Patrick Wardle recently discovered that Apple inadvertently notarized malicious payloads that were utilized in a recent adware campaign.\u201cUnfortunately a system that promises trust, yet fails to deliver, may ultimately put users at more risk,\u201d said Wardle in a Sunday analysis. \u201cHow so? If Mac users buy into Apple\u2019s claims, they are likely to fully trust any and all notarized software. This is extremely problematic as known malicious software (such as OSX.Shlayer) is already (trivially?) gaining such notarization.\u201dOn Friday, Dantini noticed that a website (homebrew[.]sh) was actively hosting an adware campaign. The website is likely spoofing the legitimate Homebrew site (hosted at brew.sh), a free and open-source software package management system that simplifies the installation of software on macOS.So I accidentally found a thing https://t.co/WVL86rYzrm\u2014 Peter H. Dantini (@PokeCaptain) August 31, 2020\u00a0When users visited the website, it redirected several times before telling them that their Adobe Flash Player is out of date and recommending an update (via at least three separate pop ups in the browser). While the campaign seems like a fairly run-of-the-mill adware attack, what\u2019s different is that Apple\u2019s notarization requirements do not trigger a warning notification telling the user that the developer cannot be verified, and that it is unknown whether the app is free from malware.The adware payloads were fully notarized in this campaign, meaning the malicious payloads were submitted to Apple prior to distribution. They were scanned by the mobile giant and no malicious code was detected via Apple\u2019s automated system.Upon further inspection, Wardle discovered that the notarized payloads appear to be OSX.Shlayer malware.After running the payloads in an instrumented virtual machine captures, Wardle was able to discover the execution of various shell commands. These commands change file modes, execute and delete files, and more.Shlayer is a top common threat for Macs \u2014 In fact, last year it made up 29 percent of all attacks on macOS devices in Kaspersky\u2019s telemetry for 2019, making it the\u00a0No. 1 Mac malware threat\u00a0for the year. More recently, a new variant of the malware has been spotted actively using poisoned Google search results in order to find its victims.After the malicious payloads were spotted, Wardle notified Apple, which revoked their certificates on Aug. 28. Then, on Aug. 30 (Sunday), the adware campaign was still live and serving up new notarized payloads.\u201cBoth the old and \u2018new\u2019 payload(s) appears to be nearly identical, containing OSX.Shlayer packaged with the Bundlore adware,\u201d said Wardle. \u201cHowever the attackers\u2019 ability to agilely continue their attack (with other notarized payloads) is noteworthy. Clearly in the never-ending cat and mouse game between the attackers and Apple, the attackers are currently (still) winning.\u201dThe Bundlore adware\u2019s goal is generally to install various browser extensions and show victims various ads, Wardle told Threatpost. As of Monday, these newer notarized payloads were also revoked by Apple, Wardle told Threatpost.\u201cMalicious software constantly changes, and Apple\u2019s notarization system helps us keep malware off the Mac and allow us to respond quickly when it\u2019s discovered,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told Threatpost. \u201cUpon learning of this adware, we revoked the identified variant, disabled the developer account, and revoked the associated certificates.

        "raw text": "UPDATEA healthy percentage of Android users targeted by mobile malware or mobile adware last year suffered a system partition infection, making the malicious files virtually undeletable.That\u2019s according to research from Kaspersky, which found that 14.8 percent of its users who suffered such attacks were left with undeletable files. These range from trojans that can install and run apps without the user\u2019s knowledge, to less threatening, but nevertheless intrusive, advertising apps.\u201cA system partition infection entails a high level of risk for the users of infected devices, as a security solution cannot access the system directories, meaning it cannot remove the malicious files,\u201d the firm explained, in a posting on Monday.Moreover, research found that most devices harbor pre-installed default applications that are also undeletable \u2013 the number of those affected varies from 1 to 5 percent of users with low-cost devices, and reaches 27 percent in extreme cases.\u201cInfection can happen via two paths: The threat gains root access on a device and installs adware in the system partition, or the code for displaying ads gets into the firmware of the device before it even ends up in the hands of the consumer,\u201d according to the firm.In the latter scenario, this could lead to potentially undesired and unplanned consequences. For instance, many smartphones have functions providing remote access to the device. If abused, such a feature could lead to a data compromise of a user\u2019s device.Unwanted and Malicious AppsAmong the most common types of malware that Kaspersky has found installed in the system partition of Android smartphones are two older threats: The Lezok and Triada trojans.\u201cThe latter is notable for its ad code embedded not just anywhere, but directly in libandroid_runtime \u2014 a key library used by almost all apps on the device,\u201d according to the analysis.However, examining victims\u2019 system apps revealed a wide range of threats.The Agent trojan for instance is an obfuscated malware that usually hides in the app that handles the graphical interface of the system, or in the Settings utility, without which the smartphone cannot function properly. The malware delivers its payload, which in turn can download and run arbitrary files on the device.Then there\u2019s the Sivu trojan, which is a dropper masquerading as an HTMLViewer app.\u201cThe malware consists of two modules and can use root permissions on the device,\u201d according to Kaspersky. \u201cThe first module displays ads on top of other windows, and in notifications. The second module is a backdoor allowing remote control of the smartphone. Its capabilities include installing, uninstalling and running apps, which can be used to covertly install both legitimate and malicious apps, depending on the intruder\u2019s goals.\u201dThe Plague adware app is another common threat that Kaspersky found installed in the system partition. It pretends to be a legitimate system service, calling itself Android Services \u2013 but in reality, it can download and install apps behind the user\u2019s back, as well as display ads in notifications.\u201cWhat\u2019s more, Plague.f can display ads in SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW \u2014 a pop-up window that sits on top of all apps,\u201d explained the researchers.The Necro.d trojan is unusual, because it\u2019s a native library located in the system directory. Its launch mechanism is built into another system library, libandroid_servers.so, which handles the operation of Android services.\u201cAt the command of the command-and-control (C2), Necro.d can download, install, uninstall and run apps,\u201d explained the researchers. \u201cIn addition, the developers decided to leave themselves a backdoor for executing arbitrary shell commands. On top of that, Necro.d can download Kingroot superuser rights utility \u2014 seemingly so that the OS security system does not interfere with delivering \u2018very important\u2019 content for the user.\u201dPenguin, Facmod, Guerrilla, Virtualinst and Secretad are also often found on mobile device system partitions.As for pre-installed adware, some devices ship with an application called \u201cAppStore,\u201d which Kaspersky researchers said appears to be hidden adware able to load under the radar and display itself in invisible windows. This eats up data and battery power, the researchers pointed out \u2013 but the app also can download and execute third-party JavaScript code.\u201cOur analysis demonstrates that mobile users are not only regularly attacked by adware and other threats, but their device may also be at risk even before they purchased it,\u201d said Igor Golovin, security researcher at Kaspersky, in a media statement. \u201cCustomers don\u2019t even suspect that they are spending their cash on a pocket-sized billboard. Some mobile device suppliers are focusing on maximizing profits through in-device advertising tools, even if those tools cause inconvenience to the device owners.\u201dIn the case of phones with pre-installed adware (Kaspersky said that Meizu devices are among the offenders), users are likely out of luck.\u201cUnfortunately, if a user purchases a device with such pre-installed advertising, it is often impossible to remove it without risking damage to the system,\u201d Kaspersky researcher Igor Golovin told Threatpost. \u201cIn this case, all hopes rest on enthusiasts who are busy creating alternative firmware for devices. But it\u2019s important to understand that reflashing can void the warranty and even damage the device.\u201dHe added, \u201cI advise users to look carefully into the model of smartphone they are looking to buy and take these risks into account. At the end of the day, it is often a choice between a cheaper device or a more user-friendly one.\u201dThis article was updated at 12:15 ET on July 8 to include more information on pre-installed adware.BEC and enterprise email fraud is surging, but DMARC can help \u2013 if it\u2019s done right.

        "raw text": "Government-funded, low-cost cell phones are shipping with pre-installed malware aimed at bombing users with unwanted ads, according to researchers.The UMX U686CL Android-based phone, which is made available to low-income citizens in the U.S. via the Lifeline Assistance Program for $35, uses a \u201cSettings\u201d app that researcher claim is actually a \u201ctrojan dropper.\u201d According to Nathan Collier, a researcher at Malwarebytes, its function is to fetch and install other applications or malware.Unfortunately for those enrolled in Lifeline, the Settings app cannot be removed. That\u2019s because the Settings app is essential and provides user access to the phone\u2019s core settings. As such, if it\u2019s uninstalled, the device becomes unusable.The code in question is \u201cheavily-obfuscated malware we detect as Android/Trojan.Dropper.Agent.UMX,\u201d Collier wrote in a post on Thursday. He added that its nuts and bolts are nearly identical to another known mobile dropper trojan, which comes in two variants called ALReceiver and ALAJobService.\u201cThe only difference between the\u2026codes are their variable names,\u201d according to the analysis.At their core, both droppers have an encoded string within the code that, once decoded, reveals a hidden library file named com.android.google.bridge.LibImp.Once it\u2019s decoded (using Base64 decoding), the library is loaded into memory using DexClassLoader. And after the library is loaded into memory, the dropper fulfills its function by installing another piece of malware \u2013 in the case of UMX U686CL, it\u2019s a known malvertising application called HiddenAds.Collier said that Malwarebytes customers have confirmed that an app called HiddenAds has suddenly appeared on their phones. After installing on a device, periodic full-screen ads will plague the user.Wireless UpdateThere\u2019s also a second concerning application pre-installed on the phone, dubbed Wireless Update. This also serves a legitimate function, receiving and installing over-the-air OS upgrades for the phone \u2013 and it does this automatically. However, it also automatically receives and installs other apps without user consent, Collier warned, making the app questionable at best.\u201cFrom the moment you log into the mobile device, Wireless Update starts auto-installing apps,\u201d he noted. \u201cThere is no user consent collected to do so, no buttons to click to accept the installs, it just installs apps on its own.\u201dThese apps have so far been malware-free, but the functionality obviously opens the door to potential malware infections down the line, Collier said. And adding to the concern is the fact that Wireless Update\u2019s code is identical to code used by a malware from a shady company called Adups Technology.\u201cAdups is a China-based company caught collecting user data, creating backdoors for mobile devices and, yes, developing auto-installers,\u201d he said. According to previous research, the Adups app has been seen installing HiddenAds and other trojans on victim devices in the past. And Adups the company has been in hot water before, after Android phone-maker BLU Products admitted to sharing reams of information with it, including the full contents of their users\u2019 text messages, real-time cell tower location data, call and text-message logs, contact lists, and applications used and installed on devices.Wireless Update can be uninstalled, but users would be left with no security fixes. Collier pointed out that this could be a decent tradeoff.Who is Responsible?Looking into how the malware got there to begin with, Collier found only dead ends and a lack of response.China is where the phones are manufactured, and the dropper app\u2019s code also appears to have been created by Chinese authors: \u201cThe more discernible variant of this malware uses Chinese characters for variable names. Therefore, we can assume the origin of this malware is China,\u201d according to the analysis.This brings up the question of whether the dropper was injected somewhere along the supply chain during the manufacturing process in Asia, unbeknownst to the manufacturer. Google last year reported an uptick in efforts by bad actors to plant potentially harmful applications on Android devices in this way.\u201cMalicious actors increased their efforts to embed PHAs into the supply chain using two main entry points: New devices sold with pre-installed PHAs and over the air (OTA) updates that bundle legitimate system updates with PHAs,\u201d wrote Google in its Android Security and Privacy Year in Review 2018, released last April. \u201cThe developers of pre-installed PHAs only need to deceive the device manufacturer or another company in the supply chain instead of large numbers of users, so it\u2019s easier to achieve large-scale distribution.\u201dMalwarebytes\u2019 Collier said that he wasn\u2019t able to confirm whether or not the company is aware of the pre-installed malware. As for Wireless Update, presumably the company made the choice to go with the Adups code for this feature, but again \u2014 this is not confirmed.Meanwhile, the phone is a Virgin Mobile-branded phone distributed by Assurance Wireless. Assurance Wireless is a federal Lifeline cell phone service provider, offering eligible customers phones, minutes and data. The phone is available at $35 under the government-funded program.\u201cWe informed Assurance Wireless of our findings and asked them point-blank why a U.S.-funded mobile carrier is selling a mobile device infected with pre-installed malware?\u201d Collier said. \u201cAfter giving them adequate time to respond, we unfortunately never heard back.\u201dThreatpost reached out to Assurance Wireless and Virgin Mobile for comment and will update this post with any additional details.Not a New IssuePre-installed malware and unwanted applications are not a new phenomenon, as noted. For instance, in an investigation of malware infections on BLU brand phones, Threatpost found that many phones came pre-installed with malware and also downloaded more malware via a third-party update tool.Consequences have been significant for some affected device manufacturers, if the malware or unwanted application is knowingly installed. For instance, Lenovo, the Chinese PC giant, came under fire in 2014 for pre-loading the Superfish code. That powered something called VisualDiscovery, which was meant to help shoppers by analyzing images on the web and presenting similar product offers with lower prices\u2014a form of targeted advertising. After a major vulnerability was found in the Superfish code, backlash was swift, given that the adware was pre-installed on machines without any disclosure on the part of Lenovo. VisualDiscovery was installed on nearly 800,000 Lenovo laptops before the issue came to light, and the laptop-maker ended up paying a $7.3 million settlement.In the case of the UMX U686CL, there\u2019s a socioeconomic disparity issue here that\u2019s worth noting, Collier pointed out: \u201cBudget should not dictate whether a user can remain safe on his or her mobile device. Shell out thousands for an iPhone, and escape pre-installed maliciousness. But use government-assisted funding to purchase a device and pay the price in malware? That\u2019s not the type of malware-free existence we envision.\u201dConcerned about mobile security?

        "raw text": "While macOS is often touted as \u201csafer\u201d on the cybersecurity front compared to Windows-based systems, cybercriminals are in fact increasingly targeting Apple\u2019s ecosystem.The number of attacks on macOS users through malicious and potentially unwanted programs has been increasing annually since 2012, and in 2018 it exceeded 4 million attacks, according to telemetry from Kaspersky released on Wednesday. The pace is staying steady so far this year: During the first half of 2019, the firm registered 1.8 million malware attacks on Macs.The trojan downloader Shlayer, which downloads and installs various adware (mainly from the Bnodlero family), is the No. 1 threat seen taking aim at macOS, according to the report. It\u2019s making use of people\u2019s thirst for pirated content.\u201cIf you try to search for sites where you can watch or download a popular movie or TV series for free, the very first search results will lead to resources that request you to update Flash Player in order to view content,\u201d the firm explained. \u201cIt is these updates that contain Shlayer.\u201dWith the exception of Shlayer, the rest of the top ten is filled out by various unwanted software belonging to the adware class, which display ads in system notifications, web page banners, search results pages, the browser and so on.The adware samples making the rounds include Bnodlero, which installs ad extensions into a browser, and changes the default search engine and homepage. In addition, it can download and install extra adware. The Pirrit adware family meanwhile goes even further and installs a proxy server on the victim\u2019s machine to intercept traffic from the browser. And, the Cimpli adware uses advanced stealth tactics, such as becoming purposely inactive if it detects an installed security solution in macOS.Two other malware families that were seen attacking macOS in the first half of the year include a trojan called Spynion and another trojan, Vidsler.The former is distributed along with several free macOS apps, mainly from sites such as MacUpdate, VersionTracker and Softpedia.\u201cWhile the app is being installed on the victim\u2019s computer, a malicious component is downloaded and installed,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe Spynion\u2019s main objective is to monitor user activity on the network and transfer intercepted confidential data to the attackers\u2019 servers. The trojan also has backdoor functionality, i.e., it allows attackers to remotely connect to the user\u2019s macOS.\u201dVidsler meanwhile is distributed via banner ad links, under the pretext of requiring the user to update video codecs or download a new version of a video player.\u201cIn terms of functionality, Vidsler is similar to Shlayer: It downloads, installs, and runs other software, most often from the FkCodec AdWare family,\u201d Kaspersky explained.New variants that have appeared this year include a previously unknown macOS malware from the North Korea-linked APT known as Lazarus Group, which attacked the financial sector earlier this year, the company said.\u201cAn extremely dangerous (but also an extremely rare) threat is a targeted attack on macOS and iOS users, mainly business users,\u201d according to the report. \u201cSeveral well-known cybercriminal groups are currently working to develop malware for these operating systems, but the likelihood that a random user will be the target of such programs is extremely small. However, if you work in a financial institution, such as, for example, a bank, and your MacBook or iPhone is a corporate device, then the chances that you will be targeted increase considerably.\u201dGeographically speaking, the top three most-targeted countries remained the same between 2018 and 2019: The United States came in first place (24.4 percent), Germany came in second (14.6 percent), and France came in third (12.4 percent).Phishing for Apple IDsBeyond malware, Kasperksy also detected nearly 6 million phishing attacks on macOS users in the first half of 2019. Of these, 11.80 percent targeted corporate users.\u201cThe data that has been collected over the last four years suggests that the number of phishing attacks on macOS users is definitely growing, and quite rapidly at that,\u201d according to the report. \u201cWhile in 2015 we registered a total of 852,293 attacks, in 2016 this figure grew by 86 percent to over 1.5 million, and in 2017 it skyrocketed to 4 million. In 2018, the number of attacks continued to grow, crossing the 7.3 million mark. At this point we can see that during the first half of 2019 alone, 5.93 million attacks were committed, which means that the number of attacks may exceed 16 million by the end of the year if the current trend continues.\u201dThe phishing pages visited by MacOS users most often pretended to be banking services (39.95 percent), the second popular being global internet portals (21.31 percent) and social networks came in third in 2019 (12.3 percent).There are also rafts of fake web pages that mimic Apple\u2019s official pages or simply mention the brand.\u201cThe attackers continue to mainly target Apple IDs, which are the users\u2019 key to gaining access to Apple\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d according to the report. \u201cApple IDs are relatively easy to monetize. For example, they can be sold to other criminals. Perhaps the theft of this type of data is now the most dangerous threat macOS users face, in terms of the balance between the probability of the attack and the damage in the event of its success. Moreover, our statistics show that this type of attack is likely to be on the rise in the near future.\u201dLinks to these sites are usually sent in emails that allegedly come from Apple Support. The recipient is threatened that their account will be locked unless they click the link and log in to confirm the information that has been specified in their profile. In another tactic, the email might thank the user for purchasing an Apple device or app on the App Store. The customer is then invited to learn more about the product (or cancel the purchase) by clicking a link that leads to a phishing page. Here, the victim is required to enter their Apple ID login and password, which, of course, will be sent to the attackers.The countries with the largest share of unique macOS users who experienced phishing attacks in the first half of the year were Brazil (30.87 percent), India (22.08 percent), and France (22.02 percent).Interested in the role of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity, for both offense and defense?

        "raw text": "More than 50 malicious apps have been discovered on the Google Play app marketplace, peddling adware to millions of Android victims.The 50 adware apps, which have been since removed, include fitness, photoshopping and gaming apps, and were installed a total of 30 million times, researchers at Avast said in a Tuesday analysis.\u201cThe adware applications are linked together by the use of third-party Android libraries which bypass the background service restrictions present in newer Android versions,\u201d researchers said in a post. \u201cThe applications in this article used the libraries to keep displaying more and more ads to the user, which is against Play store rules.\u201dNames of the apps that have been removed from Google Play include: Chess Battle, Connect the Dots, Easy Pics Cutter, Magic Gamepad \u2013 Stress Releaser & Boredom Blocker, Pro Photo Blur, Free Watermark Camera 2019, Magic Cut Out and more. A full list of screenshotted apps can be found here.Adware is a tricky type of malware which once downloaded persistently displays full-screen ads \u2013 and in some cases tries to persuade users to install further adware-ridden apps. Researchers said so far they have found two versions of the adware, dubbed \u201cTsSdk\u201d \u2013 after a term found in the code of the first version of the adware.The first version was installed 3.6 million times from Google Play apps that were simple game, fitness or photo-editing apps \u2013 such as one app called HiFit. These were mostly installed in India, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, researchers said.Interestingly, the apps peddling this first version of adware worked as advertised in their Google Play descriptions \u2013 however, they would add a malicious app shortcut and a \u201cGame Center\u201d to the victims\u2019 home screen, both of which, once clicked on, would begin to show full-screen ads, mostly for various games.\u201c[The first version of adware] is not very well obfuscated and the adware SDK is easy to spot in the code,\u201d researchers said. \u201cIt is also the less prevalent of the two versions. Some variants of [this version] also contain code that downloads further applications, prompting the user to install them.\u201dThe second version of the adware was installed a whopping 28 million times, mostly via fitness and music apps distributed in the Philippines, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Nepal and Great Britain.This second version of the adware is more advanced, as it carries out several checks before deploying full-screen ad functionality, and it\u2019s also encrypted: \u201cIt seems like the developers of the adware put a little more effort into [the newer version], as it appears newer and its code is better protected,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe adware code is encrypted using the Tencent packer, which is rather hard to unpack by analysts, but is easily captured during dynamic analysis in apklab.io.\u201dIn the video below, researchers show how the downloaded adware plays out.In addition to Google Play, this newer adware version is also distributed in Facebook ads, researchers said. In the four hours after download, this newer version shows ads every 15 minutes.Despite Google Play\u2019s January claim that it has been ramping up its offensive against malicious apps, they have continued to plague the official app store for Android devices.Just in this past January,\u00a0Google Play removed\u00a0two malicious apps that were infecting devices with a notorious banking malware bent on scooping up victim\u2019s credentials. Also, last month an Android\u00a0spyware\u00a0dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims\u2019 phones, mainly via Google Play.Also, early last year, Google\u00a0removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights to call recorders to WiFi signal boosters, which together were downloaded at least 7.5 million times from the Google Play marketplace.Google did not respond by deadline to a request for statement from Threatpost.Mobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "At least 85 fake apps harboring adware, disguised as game, TV, and remote control simulator apps have been removed from the Google Play app store.Researchers with Trend Micro said Tuesday that they found an active adware family in fake apps on the Google Play store that had been downloaded a whopping 9 million times around the world. \u00a0Once downloaded, the fake apps hide themselves on the victim\u2019s device and continue to show a full-screen ad every 15 minutes.\u201cThis adware is capable of displaying full-screen ads, hiding itself, monitoring a device\u2019s screen unlocking functionality, and running in the mobile device\u2019s background,\u201d Ecular Xu, mobile threat response engineer with Trend Micro, said in the report. \u201d After verifying our report, Google swiftly suspended the fake apps from the Play store.\u201dSome of the fake apps harboring adware.Google did not respond to a request for comment from Threatpost.After the initial ad is closed, the fake app would then show prompts like \u201cstart,\u201d \u201copen app\u201d or \u201cnext\u201d \u2013 but tapping on these buttons brings up yet another full-screen ad.The app then informs the user that it is loading or buffering \u2013 but then disappears from the phone\u2019s screen and hides the apps\u2019 icon on the device. Researchers said that the fake app still runs in the device\u2019s background after hiding itself, and is configured to keep showing ads on the user\u2019s device at regular intervals.Example of full-screen adSome of the fake apps exhibit an even trickier behavior, where they monitor the victim\u2019s actions and show an ad each time the user unlocks the mobile device\u2019s screen, researchers said.These apps are able to do so by registering \u201ca receiver module\u2026in AndroidManifest.xml so that each time a user unlocks the device it will then trigger a full-screen ad pop up,\u201d according to Xu.Though they come from different companies, researchers said that the fake apps appear to have similar behaviors, and share the same code, indicating that the adware is from the same family: \u201cWe tested each of the fake apps related to the adware family and discovered that though they come from different makers and have different APK cert public keys, they exhibit similar behaviors and share the same code,\u201d they said.One of the most-downloaded apps containing adware is the \u201cEasy Universal TV Remote,\u201d which said it allows users to control their TVs using their smartphones. The app, offered by a firm called \u201cBig Fishes,\u201d was downloaded more than 5 million times.Negative ratings in the review section of the app on Google Play gave away suspicious clues that the app was adware, including claims that it was causing phones to crash and that it was vanishing into thin air after download.In order to remove the fake apps, users can manually uninstall them on the phone\u2019s app uninstall feature.\u00a0 However, \u201cit can be difficult to get there when full-screen ads show up every 15 or 30 minutes or each time a user unlocks the device\u2019s screen,\u201d researchers said.Easy Universal TV RemoteAdware has continued to pop up on official app marketplaces.\u00a0Last year, Google removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights, call recorders to WiFi signal boosters that had been downloaded up to 7.5 million times from the Google Play marketplace.Mike Bittner, digital security & operations manager at The Media Trust, said that adware is more than just an annoyance: It can potentially be used for more malicious purposes like directing devices to steal information linked to the user\u2019s device; downloading unwanted files; and redirecting users to malicious sites.\u201cIt is tantamount to a hostile takeover of the user\u2019s browser,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce bad actors are able to collect information en masse, they can sell the information on the dark web or parlay that information for targeting activities that enable bad actors to commit identity theft or influence voter behavior.\u201dMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A strain of malware that spreads on the web via advertising platforms has mounted a large-scale, mass data harvesting campaign, opening up thousands of Android users to follow-on attacks. Researchers said it\u2019s likely there\u2019s an organized crime ring operating behind the scenes.Named ICEPick\u20103PC by the Media Trust, the malware is a sophisticated form of adware using rarely seen techniques, according to Mike Bittner, digital security and operations manager at the firm.\u201cPublishers and website owners are outsourcing advertising management \u2013 what goes into delivery of an ad, such as its animation, is then handled by third-party code,\u201d Bittner told Threatpost. \u201cDuring the implementation of this code by third-party agencies, malicious code is injected into the library to hijack that operation.\u201dSpecifically, the bad code has been seen being injected into the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP), which is a library of JavaScript tools for HTML5 animation.\u201cMalicious code is injected into TweenMax, one of GSAP\u2019s most popular tools, and CreateJS, another suite of tools, while self\u2010service agencies implement the libraries on a website,\u201d the Media Trust noted in a posting Wednesday about the malware.When a user clicks on an infected ad, the malware makes an RTC peer connection between the infected device and a remote peer. It then profiles the user\u2019s device, and sends the extracted device IP to the remote user. The malware\u2019s name, ICEPick-3PC, is actually a nod to the ICE protocol used to establish the RTC peer connection.The malware harvests device fingerprinting information such as user agent, device type and whether the device is an Android device. It also checks the battery level, and the device\u2019s motion and orientation activity in order to verify that it\u2019s actually being used by a human being. If the device checks out as an attractive target, ICEPick\u20103PC extracts IP information.\u201cOne main component of this attack that\u2019s interesting and that speaks to its sophistication is the fact that it actually establishes a peer-to-peer connection and successfully extracts the private IP address of the Android user,\u201d Bittner said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we have never before seen on a massive scale. Usually you see adware performing simple redirects to pop-ups resulting in a phishing attempt.\u201dThe malware has been seen affecting more than 100 clients of The Media Trust, including recognized publishers and major e\u2010commerce businesses in retail, healthcare and a variety of other industries that get tens of thousands of visitors per month.\u201cWe don\u2019t typically see this, the actual targeting of specific users on such a mass scale,\u201d said Bittner. \u201cIt\u2019s using an advertising platform as a way to reach a mass audience to infect, targeting by geography and user agent. It has a level of sophistication and specificity that we don\u2019t typically see in adware.\u201dThis extraction and collection of IPs on such a large scale marks a significant advancement in malware authoring, according to the Media Trust.\u201cStealing IP en masse with such efficiency demands rarefied coding skills,\u201d the researchers said in the posting. \u201cThis malware has overcome such hurdles and even breaks through VPNs in order to intercept IPs.\u201dOverall, the data enables bad actors to identify users\u2019 device vulnerabilities, and leaves the devices wide open for potential future attacks. \u201cThe reason the IP is significant is that you can get user agent and device type relatively easily, but the IP can be used for future exploit targeting,\u201d Bittner said. \u201cThere are any number of open-source tools for bad actors that can give you a profile on a particular device and determine what potential exploits they\u2019re vulnerable to.\u201dThe malware\u2019s level of sophistication and advanced techniques points to a well-organized criminal operation behind it all. The attack on recognized publishers and e\u2010commerce businesses \u201cmight portend a larger\u2010scale attack, or, at the minimum, the illegal trading of user information, in the near future,\u201d the firm said.In order to protect sites from ICEPick-3PC, publishers and e\u2010commerce businesses should thoroughly vet the self\u2010service ad agencies they work with for security weaknesses and avoid repeat offenders. They can also detect such offenders by scanning interactive ads and site pages for unauthorized code.\u00a0MalwareMobile SecurityPrivacy",

        "raw text": "UPDATEApple removed the top-rated app Adware Doctor from its official Mac App Store after researchers publicly exposed the privacy-busting app on Friday. The app was removed the same day. In addition to Adware Doctor, Apple also took action against a number of different macOS apps that also collected browser history data.Apple was initially alerted to the rogue app in early August \u2013 over a month ago. But it appears, only after faced with public scrutiny,\u00a0did Apple remove the app. The app, which cost $5, was listed on Apple\u2019s Mac App Store as the company\u2019s fourth-highest \u201cTop Paid\u201d software program.Researchers said the app violates Apple\u2019s sandboxing security policies by surreptitiously copying a user\u2019s entire browser history and cookies and sending both to a China-based domain.The researcher that goes by the Twitter handle @privacyis1st is credited for first spotting the app early last month. After discovering the app, the researcher reached out to Patrick Wardle, chief research officer at Digita Security and founder of Mac security company Objective-See, to assist in analyzing the app.\u201cWe tore apart Adware Doctor\u2026 [and] our research uncovered blatant violations of user privacy and complete disregard of Apple\u2019s App Store Guidelines,\u201d Wardle wrote in a technical analysis of the\u00a0app posted on Friday. \u201cThere is rather a massive privacy issue here. Let\u2019s face it, your browsing history provides a glimpse into almost every aspect of your life.\u201dLast week, Apple did not answer Threatpost\u2019s questions as to why the app wasn\u2019t removed sooner. The company has publicly said that the sandboxing issues tied to the data exfiltration of browser histories and cookies has been fixed in its upcoming Mojave macOS.Related Apps Also Get the BootIn a separate report, additional macOS apps were also flagged for violating Apple\u2019s security rules for developers. Mac App Store applications identified as \u201cOpen Any Files\u201d and \u201cDr. Antivirus\u201d and \u201cDr. Cleaner\u201d were also observed exfiltrating Safari, Chrome and Firefox browsing and search histories.The apps were identified by Malwarebytes, who notified Apple of the behavior of the app Open Any Files in December 2017. On Sunday, all three of the apps were removed from the Apple Mac App Store, according to a report by publication\u00a09to5Mac\u2019s\u00a0Guilherme Rambo.\u00a0 \u200fOn Monday Trend Micro moved to set the record straight on apps it distributed: Dr Cleaner, Dr Cleaner Pro, Dr. Antivirus, Dr. Unarchiver, Dr. Battery and Duplicate Finder. It said in a blog post that the apps were being unfairly characterized as duplicitous.\u201cReports that Trend Micro is \u2018stealing user data\u2019 and sending them to an unidentified server in China are absolutely false,\u201d it wrote in a statement. The company acknowledged that its apps \u201ccollected and uploaded a small snapshot of the browser history on a one-time basis, covering the 24 hours prior to installation.\u201d It explained it this way:This was a one-time data collection, done for security purposes (to analyze whether a user had recently encountered adware or other threats, and thus to improve the product & service). The potential collection and use of browser history data was explicitly disclosed in the applicable EULAs and data collection disclosures accepted by users for each product at installation (see, for example, the Dr Cleaner data collection disclosure here:\u00a0\u00a0https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1119854.aspx). The browser history data was uploaded to a U.S.-based server hosted by AWS and managed/controlled by Trend Micro.Trend Micro then followed up with an update that read:We have taken action and have 3 updates to share with all of you.First, we have completed the removal of browser collection features across our consumer products in question. Second, we have permanently dumped all legacy logs, which were stored on US-based AWS servers. This includes the one-time 24 hour log of browser history held for 3 months and permitted by users upon install. Third, we believe we identified a core issue which is humbly the result of the use of common code libraries. We have learned that browser collection functionality was designed in common across a few of our applications and then deployed the same way for both security-oriented as well as the non-security oriented apps such as the ones in discussion. This has been corrected.The company is not affiliated with the\u00a0Open Any Files, mentioned by Malwarebytes.\u201cWe\u2019ve reported software like this (Open Any Files) to Apple for years, via a variety of channels, and there is rarely any immediate effect,\u201d wrote Thomas Reed, director of Mac and Mobile at Malwarebytes. \u201cIn some cases, we\u2019ve seen offending apps removed quickly, although sometimes\u00a0 those same apps have come back quickly (as was the case with Adware Doctor). In other cases, it has taken as long as six months for a reported app to be removed.\u201dReed contends that Adware Doctor was originally listed in 2015 as Adware Medic. Reed said he complained to Apple that Adware Medic was a copy of his own app (also called Adware Medic). \u201cIt was eventually removed, but was replaced soon after by an identical app named Adware Doctor,\u201d he said.(This article was updated on 9/11/2018 at 9:30am ET to include comments from Trend Micro.)Privacy",

        "raw text": "A malicious Telegram instant-messaging app installer scurries past a slew of antivirus (AV) engines to deliver Purple Fox malware, evading detection by separating the attack into bite-sized morsels that fly under the radar.In a Monday report, Minerva Labs said that the attack evades detection by AV products from the likes of Avira, ESET, Kaspersky, McAfee, Panda, Trend Micro, Symantec and many more.\u201cWe have often observed threat actors using legitimate software for dropping malicious files,\u201d analysts wrote. \u201cThis time however is different. This threat actor was able to leave most parts of the attack under the radar by separating the attack into several small files, most of which had very low detection rates by AV engines, with the final stage leading to Purple Fox rootkit infection.\u201dThe malicious installer, bearing the familiar Telegram icon of a white paper plane, is actually a compiled AutoIt script called \u201cTelegram Desktop.exe.\u201d The installer creates a new folder named \u201cTextInputh\u201d under C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\. It drops two files into the folder: an actual Telegram installer (which isn\u2019t executed), and a malicious downloader, TextInputh.exe.Files dropped by compiled AutoIT. Source: Minerva Labs.The malicious downloader, TextInputh.exe, creates a new folder named \u201c1640618495\u201d under the C:\\Users\\Public\\Videos\\ directory. In the next stage of the attack, the executable contacts a command-and-control (C2) server \u2013 a C2 that was already down at the time of investigation \u2013 and downloads two files to the new folder: a legitimate 7z archiver and a RAR archive (1.rar).The 1.rar archive contains the payload and the configuration files, as shown in the image below. The 7z program unpacks everything onto the ProgramData folder.Files contained in 1.rar. Source: Minerva Labs.TextInputh.exe then performs these actions on infected machines:Copies 360.tct with \u201c360.dll\u201d name, rundll3222.exe and svchost.txt to the ProgramData folderExecutes ojbk.exe with the \u201cojbk.exe -a\u201d command lineDeletes 1.rar and 7zz.exe and exits the processSource: Minerva Labs.Next, a registry key is created for persistence, a DLL (rundll3222.dll) disables Microsoft\u2019s User Account Control (UAC) malware-inhibiting security control, the payload (svchost.txt) is executed, and these five additional files are dropped onto the infected system:Calldriver.exeDriver.sysdll.dllkill.batspeedmem2.hgUAC is a Windows security feature designed to prevent changes to an operating system by unauthorized users, applications or malware. Bypassing UAC is a key function that\u2019s regularly coded into malware. With UAC out of the picture, any programs that run on an infected system \u2013 including viruses and malware \u2013 are free to gain administrator privileges.Small Files Cluster-Block 360 AVThe five files that fly under the radar \u201cwork together to shut down and block the initiation of 360 AV processes from the kernel space, thus allowing the next stage attack tools (Purple Fox rootkit, in our case) to run without being detected,\u201d according to Minerva Labs\u2019 writeup.\u201cThe beauty of this attack is that every stage is separated to a different file which are useless without the entire file set,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThis helps the attacker protect his files from AV detection.\u201dAfter blocking 360 AV, the malware then gathers the following list of system information, checks to see if a long list of security tools are running, and, finally, sends all the information to a hardcoded C2 address.HostnameCPU \u2013 by retrieving a value of HKLM\\HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System\\CentralProcessor\\0\\ ~MHz registry keyMemory statusDrive TypeProcessor Type \u2013 by calling GetNativeSystemInfo and checking the value of wProcessorArchitecture.The Latest Bite from the Rabid Purple FoxPurple Fox, which first appeared in 2018, is a malware campaign that up until March required user interaction or some kind of third-party tool to infect Windows machines. Last spring, the attackers behind the campaign skipped over that crutch by empowering the malware with the ability to brute force its way into victims\u2019 systems on its own, according to research from Guardicore Labs. At the same time, Purple Fox was outfitted with a rootkit that allowed it to burrow in, evade detection and establish persistence.Minerva Labs said that it found a large number of malicious installers delivering the same Purple Fox rootkit version using the same attack chain. It\u2019s not entirely clear how it\u2019s being distributed, though analysts believe that some were delivered via email, while others were presumably downloaded from phishing sites.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.Malware",

        "raw text": "LEIPZIG, GERMANY \u2013 Researchers hunting cyber-espionage group Sednit (an APT also known as Sofacy, Fancy Bear and APT28) say they have discovered the first-ever instance of a rootkit targeting the Windows Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) in successful attacks.The discussion of Sednit was part of the 35C3 conference, and a session given by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vachon, a malware researcher at ESET who published a technical write-up on his findings earlier this fall (PDF). During his session, Vachon said that finding a rootkit targeting a system\u2019s UEFI is significant, given that rootkit malware programs can survive on the motherboard\u2019s flash memory, giving it both persistence and stealth.\u201cUEFI rootkits have been researched and discussed heavily in the past few years, but sparse evidence has been presented of real campaigns actively trying to compromise systems at this level,\u201d he said.The rootkit is named LoJax. The name is a nod to the underlying code, which is a modified version of Absolute Software\u2019s LoJack recovery software for laptops. The purpose of the legitimate LoJack software is to help victims of a stolen laptop be able to access their PC without tipping off the bad guys who stole it. It hides on a system\u2019s UEFI and stealthily beacons its whereabouts back to the owner for possible physical recovery of the laptop.Each time the system restarts, the code executes on boot, before the OS loads and before the system\u2019s antivirus software is launched. That means that even if the device\u2019s hard drive is replaced, the LoJack software will still operate.According to Vachon, the bad guys are making good use of this with LoJax. This weaponized, customized version of Absolute Software\u2019s wares dates back to a vulnerable 2009 version, which had several key bugs, chief among them a configuration module that was poorly secured with weak encryption.\u201cThis vulnerability allowed Sednit to customize a single byte that contains the domain information for the legitimate software to connect to in order to download the recovery software,\u201d he said. In the case of LoJax, the single byte contained Sednit command-and-control domains that ultimately delivered the rootkit payload.The infection chain is typical: An attack begins with a phishing email or equivalent, successfully tricking a victim into downloading and executing a small rpcnetp.exe dropper agent. The rpcnetp.exe installs and reaches out to the system\u2019s Internet Explorer browser, which is used to communicate with the configured domains.\u201cOnce I have a foothold on the machine I can use this tool to deploy the UEFI rootkit,\u201d Vachon explained, adding that the hacker tool takes advantage firmware vendors allowing remote flashing. \u201cUEFI rootkit is located in the BIOS region of the serial peripheral interface (SPI) flash memory,\u201d he said.Once the UEFI rootkit is installed, there\u2019s not much a user can do to remove it besides re-flashing the SPI memory or throwing out the motherboard, Vachon said.In May, Arbor Networks spotted LoJack being reused by Sednit agents to develop LoJax. But it wasn\u2019t until September that Sednit began to use it in live campaigns, observed by ESET. These are targeting mostly government entities located in the Balkans, as well as Central and Eastern Europe.ESET said it identified a customer who had been infected by the rogue version of the LoJax. And last month, the Pentagon made a good-faith gesture to be more open and started uploading\u00a0malware samples from APTs\u00a0and other nation-state sources to the website VirusTotal.\u00a0The first\u00a0two samples\u00a0were rpcnetp.dll and rpcnetp.exe, which are both detected as dropper mechanisms for the UEFI rootkit.By enabling Secure Boot, and making sure their UEFI firmware is up to date, end users can protect themselves against attack, Vachon said.HacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Apple has patched a vulnerability in macOS can allow attackers to bypass a key OS protection and install a malicious rootkit to perform arbitrary operations on a device, researchers from Microsoft have discovered.The problem\u2014dubbed \u201cShrootless\u201d\u2013is associated with a security technology called System Integrity Protection (SIP) found in macOS. Jonathan Bar Or from the Microsoft 365 Defender Research Team explained in a blog post that SIP restricts a user at the root level of the OS from performing operations that may compromise system integrity.Researchers were assessing processes entitled to bypass SIP protections when they discovered the vulnerability, which is being tracked as CVE-2021-30892, Or wrote.\u201cWe found that the vulnerability lies in how Apple-signed packages with post-install scripts are installed,\u201d he explained in the post. \u201cA malicious actor could create a specially crafted file that would hijack the installation process. After bypassing SIP\u2019s restrictions, the attacker could then install a malicious kernel driver (rootkit), overwrite system files, or install persistent, undetectable malware, among others.\u201dMicrosoft Security Vulnerability Research (MSVR) shared the researchers\u2019 findings to Apple through its Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), and the company responded promptly, Or said. Apple included a fix for the flaw in a raft of security updates it released on Oct. 26Microsoft\u2019s interest in a MacOS flaw demonstrates researchers\u2019 interest in security for \u00a0enterprise networks that use hybrid environments, which increase the attack surface for threat actors to compromise myriad devices regardless of OS, Or noted.\u201cThis OS-level vulnerability and others that will inevitably be uncovered add to the growing number of possible attack vectors for attackers to exploit,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs networks become increasingly heterogeneous, the number of threats that attempt to compromise non-Windows devices also increases.\u201dHow SIP WorksOr explained how SIP works to give context for the flaw. Apple first introduced the process, also known as \u201crootless,\u201d in macOS Yosemite. The process \u201cessentially locks down the system from root by leveraging the Apple sandbox to protect the entire platform,\u201d Or explained.Two NVRAM variables control the system: csr-active-config, a bitmask of enabled protections; and csr-data, which stores netboot configuration.\u201cThese variables cannot be legitimately modified in non-recovery mode,\u201d Or wrote. \u201cTherefore, the only legitimate way to disable SIP is by booting into recovery mode and turning SIP off. Turning SIP on or off is done using the built-in csrutil tool, which can also display the SIP status.\u201dSIP has a number of protections that it uses to secure the macOS kernel and other root processes. Attackers can bypass SIP, however, using a number of attack scenarios, Or wrote.For instance, they could load untrusted kernel extensions could compromise the kernel and allow the said extensions to perform operations without any checks, or bypass filesystem checks that allow a kernel extension to enforce SIP to itself completely. Attackers also could freely modify the NVRAM to control SIP itself, researchers said.Breakdown of ShrootlessResearchers discovered Shrootless when, in their analysis, they came across the daemon system_installd, which has the powerful com.apple.rootless.install.heritable entitlement. With this entitlement, any child process of system_installd would be able to bypass SIP filesystem restrictions altogether, Or wrote.Upon examining all the child processes of system_installd, researchers discovered a few cases that could allow attackers to abuse its functionality and bypass SIP, he explained.\u201cFor instance, when installing an Apple-signed package (.PKG file), the said package invokes system_installd, which then takes charge of installing the former,\u201d Or wrote. \u201cIf the package contains any post-install scripts, system_installd runs them by invoking a default shell, which is zsh on macOS. Interestingly, when zsh starts, it looks for the file /etc/zshenv, and \u2014 if found \u2014 runs commands from that file automatically, even in non-interactive mode.\u201dTherefore, an attacker can perform arbitrary operations on the device by creating a malicious /etc/zshenv file and then waiting for system_installd to invoke zsh, he explained.Researchers created a fully functional proof-of-concept (PoC) Shrootless exploit that could override the kernel extension exclusion list using three steps. The PoC downloads an Apple-signed package (using wget) that is known to have a post-install script; then plants a malicious /etc/zshenv that checks for its parent process; and finally, if it\u2019s system_installd, writes to restricted locations; and invokes the installer utility to install the package.The Microsoft team also found that zshenv could be used as a general attack technique as a persistence mechanism or to elevate privileges besides being used for a SIP bypass, Or wrote.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Microsoft signed a driver being distributed within gaming environments that turned out to be a malicious network filter rootkit.G DATA malware analyst Karsten Hahn first noticed the rootkit, publicly posting the find on June 17 and simultaneously reaching out to Microsoft. Hahn noted that the code \u2013 a third-party driver for Windows named Netfilter that has been circulating in the gaming community \u2013 connected to an IP address in China.As Hahn detailed in a security advisory on Friday, G DATA analysts first thought their telemetry had popped up a false positive on a legitimately signed file. But there was nothing wrong with the telemetry, it turned out: It was legitimately malicious, Hahn wrote.According to WHOIS records, the command-and-control (C2) address \u2013 IP 110.42.4.180 \u2013 that the malicious Netfilter driver connected to belonged to Ningbo Zhuo Zhi Innovation Network Technology Co. Ltd.WHOIS search for the IP address. Source: Threatpost.On Friday, Microsoft confirmed the incident, saying that it had launched an internal investigation, has added malware signatures to Windows Defender, and has shared the signatures with security companies. As of Monday morning, 35 security vendors had flagged the file as malicious.As of Friday, Microsoft was still trying to figure out how a rootkit could slip through the signing process.Microsoft signature details on network filter rootkit. Source: VirusTotal.Here\u2019s Hahn:What started as a false positive alert for a Microsoft signed file turns out to be a WFP [Windows Filtering Platform] application layer enforcement callout driver that redirects traffic to a Chinese IP. How did this happen?Third-Party Account SuspendedMicrosoft said in its advisory that it\u2019s now investigating a malicious actor that\u2019s \u201cdistributing malicious drivers within gaming environments.\u201d The threat actor submitted drivers for certification through the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program (WHCP), which is designed to ensure that Windows-compatible software and hardware run smoothly on Windows 10, Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 and to provide guidance for developing, testing and distributing drivers.\u201cUsing the Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard, you can manage submissions, track the performance of your device or app, review telemetry and much more,\u201d according to Microsoft\u2019s site.And, apparently, you can spread yet more hurt on the already beleaguered gaming industry, which has been pummeled by pandemic-bored attackers. The onslaught has included every Sony PlayStation 3 ID out there being compromised, provoking bans of legit players on the network; hackers cracking pirated games with cryptojacking malware; and the Steam gaming platform being used to host malware.Microsoft has suspended the malicious-driver-disseminating account and has reviewed the threat actor\u2019s submissions for additional signs of malware.The Goal: To Cheat at GamingMicrosoft said the repercussions of this attack are limited. It hasn\u2019t seen any sign of the WHCP signing certificate having been exposed, nor of any infrastructure having been compromised. According to its advisory, the rootkit-spreader is limiting its activity specifically to China and apparently isn\u2019t targeting enterprises. Microsoft isn\u2019t attributing the attack to a nation-state actor at this point.The company said that the threat actor\u2019s goal is to cheat gaming systems: \u201cTo use the driver to spoof their geo-location to cheat the system and play from anywhere,\u201d according to Microsoft\u2019s advisory. \u201cThe malware enables them to gain an advantage in games and possibly exploit other players by compromising their accounts through common tools like keyloggers.\u201dMicrosoft said that an important piece of the puzzle is the fact that the techniques used in the attack occur after exploitation: In other words, an attacker must \u201ceither have already gained administrative privileges in order to be able to run the installer to update the registry and install the malicious driver the next time the system boots or convince the user to do it on their behalf,\u201d its advisory stressed.The company said that it plans to share an update regarding how it will refine its partner access policies, validation and the signing process to boost its protections. It said that customers don\u2019t have to take any actions: Just follow security best practices and deploy antivirus software, it recommended.Bad Certificates = Great Way to Spring Supply-Chain AttacksDigital certificates allow their owners to cryptographically link ownership to a public key for authentication purposes. They\u2019re one way for threat actors to escape detection as they fool users into downloading malware because it appears legitimate to their systems, as ReversingLabs\u2019 Tomislav Pericin noted back in 2019, when researchers spied cybercriminals duping certificate authorities by impersonating legitimate entities. They turned around and sold the fraudulently purchased certificates on the black market, where they were purchased by other threat actors and used to digitally sign malicious files \u2013 mainly, adware.But malicious actors can ramp it up far past adware, as was evidenced in the SolarWinds attack, in which the component that contained the malware was code-signed with the appropriate SolarWinds certificate, as noted by Ray Kelly, principal security engineer at WhiteHat Security. The signature made the DLL look like \u201ca legitimate and safe component\u201d for SolarWinds\u2019 Orion product, Kelly observed, and from there, it was bundled into a \u201cpatch\u201d and distributed across thousands of customers.Join Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a cyberattack that uses unusual evasion tactics to backdoor French organizations with a novel malware dubbed Serpent, they said.A team from Proofpoint observed what they call an \u201cadvanced, targeted threat\u201d that uses email-based lures and malicious files typical of many malware campaigns to deliver its ultimate payload to targets in the French construction, real-estate and government industries.However, between initial contact and payload, the attack uses methods to avoid detection that haven\u2019t been seen before, researchers revealed in a blog post Monday.These include the use of a legitimate software package installer called Chocolatey as an initial payload, equally legitimate Python tools that wouldn\u2019t be flagged in network traffic, and a novel detection-bypass technique using a Scheduled Task, they said.\u201cThe ultimate objectives of the threat actor are presently unknown,\u201d Proofpoint researchers Bryan Campbell, Zachary Abzug, Andrew Northern and Selena Larson acknowledged in the post. \u201cSuccessful compromise would enable a threat actor to conduct a variety of activities, including stealing information, obtaining control of an infected host or installing additional payloads.\u201dSerpent: A Slippery Attack ChainThe attack chain begins as many email-based attacks do\u2014with an email that appears to be coming from a legitimate source that includes a Microsoft Word document containing malicious macros. Various parts of the macro include ASCII art that depicts a snake, giving the backdoor its name, researchers said.The macro-laden document purports to have important information related to the \u201cr\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es (RGPD),\u201d aka the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), a law which mandates how companies must report data leaks to the government.If macros are enabled, the document executes the document\u2019s macro, which reaches out to an image URL\u2013e.g., https://www.fhccu[.]com/images/ship3[.]jpg\u2013that contains a base64 encoded PowerShell script hidden using steganography.The PowerShell script first downloads, installs and updates the installer package and repository script for Chocolatey, a software management automation tool for Windows that wraps installers, executables, .ZIP files and scripts into compiled packages, researchers said.\u201cLeveraging Chocolatey as an initial payload may allow the threat actor to bypass threat-detection mechanisms because it is a legitimate software package and would not immediately be identified as malicious,\u201d researchers noted.The script then uses Chocolatey to install Python, including the\u00a0pip\u00a0Python package installer. This component then installs various dependencies including\u00a0PySocks, a Python-based reverse proxy client that enables users to send traffic through SOCKS and HTTP proxy servers, researchers said.Next, the PowerShell script fetches another image file\u2013e.g. https://www.fhccu[.]com/images/7[.]jpg,\u2013which contains a base64 encoded Python script that also is obscured using steganography, they said. The PowerShell script saves the Python script as \u201cMicrosoftSecurityUpdate.py\u201d and then creates and executes a .bat file that in turn executes the Python script.The attack chain ends with a command to a shortened URL which redirects to the Microsoft Office help website, researchers said. The steganographic images used to hide the scripts are hosted on what appears to be a Jamaican credit-union website, they added.Serpent BackdoorOnce successfully installed on a targeted system, the Serpent backdoor periodically pings the \u201corder\u201d server, or the first onion[.]pet URL), and expects responses of the form <random integer>\u2013<hostname>\u2013<command>.If <hostname> matches the hostname of the infected computer, the infected host runs the command provided by the order server (<command>), researchers said. This could be any Windows command as designated by the attacker, the output of which is then recorded.Next, Serpent uses PySocks to connect to the command-line Pastebin tool called Termbin, pastes the output to a bin, and receives the bin\u2019s unique URL.As its final act, the backdoor sends a request to the \u201canswer\u201d server (a second onion[.]pet URL), including the hostname and bin URL in the header. This allows the attacker to monitor the bin outputs via the \u201canswer\u201d URL and see what the infected host\u2019s response was, researchers observed. Once this entire process is complete, Serpent cycles through it indefinitely, they added.Task-Scheduler Evasion TacticIn addition to using steganographic images and the Chocolatey package installer to hide its nefarious activities, the attack also uses what Proofpoint researchers said is a never-before-seen application of signed binary proxy execution using a Scheduled Tasks executable, as \u201can attempt to bypass detection by defensive measures.\u201dA command that leverages schtasks.exe to create a one-time task to call a portable executable is contained within a Swiper image called ship.jpg after the end of file marker, researchers said.\u201cIn this case the executable is called calc.exe,\u201d researchers wrote in the post. The trigger for this task is contingent on the creation of a Windows event with EventID of 777, after which the command then creates a dummy event to trigger the task ,and deletes the task from the task scheduler as if it never occurred, they said.\u201cThis peculiar application of tasking logic results in the portable executable being executed as a child process of taskhostsw.exe, which is a signed Windows binary,\u201d researchers said.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The Daxin malware is taking aim at hardened government networks around the world, according to researchers, with the goal of cyberespionage.The Symantec Threat Hunter team noticed the advanced persistent threat (APT) weapon in action in November, noting that it\u2019s \u201cthe most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have seen from China-linked actors\u2026exhibiting technical complexity previously unseen by such actors.\u201dThey added that Daxin\u2019s specific scope of operations includes reading and writing arbitrary files; starting and interacting with arbitrary processes; and advanced lateral movement and stealth capabilities.The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also flagged the activity, which Symantec characterized as \u201clong-running.\u201d The earliest known sample of the malware dates from 2013, when it already had a large part of the codebase fully developed.\u201cDaxin malware is a highly sophisticated rootkit backdoor with complex, stealthy command-and-control (C2) functionality that enabled remote actors to communicate with secured devices not connected directly to the internet,\u201d warned CISA, in a Monday alert. \u201cDaxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the actors to deeply burrow into targeted networks and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.\u201dBuilt for StealthFrom a technical standpoint, Daxin takes the form of a Windows kernel driver, according to Symantec\u2019s Monday analysis, and has a focus on stealth.\u201cDaxin\u2019s capabilities suggest the attackers invested significant effort into developing communication techniques that can blend in unseen with normal network traffic on the target\u2019s network,\u201d the firm found. \u201cSpecifically, the malware avoids starting its own network services. Instead, it can abuse any legitimate services already running on the infected computers.\u201dIt communicates with legitimate services via network tunneling, they added \u2013 and further, it can set up daisy-chain communications, researchers added to move internally via hops between several linked computers.\u201cDaxin is also capable of relaying its communications across a network of infected computers within the attacked organization,\u201d they said. \u201cThe attackers can select an arbitrary path across infected computers and send a single command that instructs these computers to establish requested connectivity. This use case has been optimized by Daxin\u2019s designers.\u201dDaxin also can hijack legitimate TCP/IP connections. According to Symantec, it monitors all incoming TCP traffic for certain patterns, and when a preferred pattern is detected, it disconnects the legitimate recipient and takes over the connection.\u201cIt then performs a custom key exchange with the remote peer, where two sides follow complementary steps. The malware can be both the initiator and the target of a key exchange,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cA successful key exchange opens an encrypted communication channel for receiving commands and sending responses. Daxin\u2019s use of hijacked TCP connections affords a high degree of stealth to its communications and helps to establish connectivity on networks with strict firewall rules. It may also lower the risk of discovery by SOC analysts monitoring for network anomalies.\u201dWhen all of this is put together, the result is that a single command message that includes all the details required to establish communication, specifically the node IP address, its TCP port number and the credentials to use during custom key exchange. When Daxin receives this message, it picks the next node from the list.The research team linked Daxin to Chinese actors because it\u2019s usually deployed alongside tools known to be associated with Chinese espionage actors.\u201cMost of the targets appear to be organizations and governments of strategic interest to China,\u201d they added. \u201cDaxin is without doubt the most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have seen used by a China-linked actor.\u201dMoving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The Roaming Mantis Android malware campaign has buzzed into Europe, quickly infesting France in particular, where there have been 66,789 downloads of the group\u2019s specific remote access trojan (RAT) as of January.The campaign pushes the Android RAT known as Wroba (aka Moqhao or XLoader) onto victim devices. According to research from Kaspersky, it has been updated with the ability to exfiltrate images and galleries from a victim device, which potentially paves the way for lifting sensitive information from things like drivers\u2019 licenses, abusing stored QR codes for payment services, or even for blackmail or sextortion.Roaming Mantis has been on the move since 2018, mostly observed in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Now, its arrival in France has resulted in that country seeing the highest volume of attacks worldwide, according to researchers at Kaspersky. There have also been detections in Germany.\u201cThe actor is focusing on expanding infection via smishing to users in Europe,\u201d Kaspersky researchers noted in a Monday writeup. \u201cThe campaign in France and Germany was so active that it came to the attention of the German police and French media.\u201dThe campaign typically spreads via \u201csmishing\u201d \u2013 i.e., SMS-based phishing, usually impersonating Google Chrome or a region-specific entity such as Yamato Transport in Japan.\u201cTypically, the smishing messages contain a very short description and a URL to a landing page,\u201d they explained. \u201cIf a user clicks on the link and opens the landing page, there are two scenarios: iOS users are redirected to a phishing page imitating the official Apple website, while the Wroba malware is downloaded on Android devices.\u201dThe Wroba RAT has a feature that checks the region of the infected device in order to display a phishing page in the corresponding language. In the past, it has checked for Asian regions, but Germany and France have been added as well, according to Kaspersky.Interestingly, researchers also found that for non-targeted regions, the landing page blocks the connection from the source IP address, so the user just receives a fake \u201c404\u201d error page.Recent Obfuscation UpdatesThe criminal group behind Roaming Mantis has recently updated some of its other tactics and tools, including adding various obfuscation techniques to the proceedings in order to evade detection.\u201cFirst, the actor changed the programming language from Java to Kotlin, a programming language designed to interoperate fully with Java,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThen\u2026the data structure of the embedded payload\u2026was also modified.\u201dThe first-stage payload, a loader that fetches Wroba, is now encased in a carapace of junk code, the researchers found. It\u2019s an .ELF file was embedded into the .APK file that\u2019s downloaded to the device. The .ELF file uses Java Native Interface (JNI) to install the second-stage payload, for decryption and also part of the loading feature, according to the researchers.\u201cThe loader function takes each section of data from the embedded data, except the junk data,\u201d they explained. \u201cThen, the encrypted payload is XORed using the embedded XOR key. After the XOR operation, as with previous samples, the data is decompressed using zlib to extract the payload, a Dalvik Executable (DEX) file.\u201dThe decrypted payload is then saved and executed to infect the malicious main module on victim devices.Stealing ImagesAs for the Wroba backdoor itself, the RAT has received two new data-stealing commands: \u201cget_photo\u201d and \u201cget_gallery.\u201d This brings the total number of embedded backdoor commands to 21, according to Kaspersky.\u201cThese new backdoor commands are added to steal galleries and photos from infected devices,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cThis suggests the criminals have two aims in mind. One possible scenario is that the criminals steal details from such things as driver\u2019s licenses, health insurance cards or bank cards, to sign up for contracts with QR code payment services or mobile payment services. The criminals are also able to use stolen photos to get money in other ways, such as blackmail or sextortion.\u201dThey added, \u201cWe predict these attacks will continue in 2022 because of the strong financial motivation.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareMobile SecurityPrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) Charming Kitten is sharpening its claws with a new set of tools, including a novel PowerShell backdoor and related stealth tactics, that show the group evolving yet again. The new tools may signal that it\u2019s getting ready to pounce on new victims, researchers believe.Researchers at cybersecurity firm Cybereason discovered the tools, which include a backdoor they dubbed \u201cPowerLess Backdoor,\u201d as well as an evasive maneuver to run the backdoor in a .NET context rather than as one that triggers a PowerShell process, the Cybereason Nocturnus Team wrote in a report published Tuesday.\u201cThe Cybereason Nocturnus Team was able to identify a new toolset that includes a novel backdoor, malware loaders, a browser info stealer, and a keylogger,\u201d Cybereason Senior Malware Researcher Daniel Frank wrote in the report.The team also identified links between Charming Kitten and the Memento ransomware that emerged late last year and until now has been unattributed, signaling that the APT may be moving beyond its typical cyberespionage tactics and into new cybercriminal territory, researchers said.Charming Kitten is a prolific APT believed to be backed by the Iranian government and known by a number of other names \u2013 including TA453, APT35, Ajax Security Team, NewsBeef, Newscaster and Phosphorus.The group \u2013 which first rose to prominence in 2018 \u2013 was extremely active throughout 2020 and 2021 and is best known for targeted cyber-espionage attacks against politicians, journalists, human-rights activists, researchers, scholars and think tanks.Some of the APT\u2019s more high-profile attacks occurred in 2020, when the group targeted the Trump and Biden presidential campaigns as well as attendees of two global geo-political summits, the Munich Security Conference and the Think 20 (T20) Summit, in separate and various incidents.New Quiver of MalwareThe Cybereason Nocturnus team uncovered a raft of new Charming Kitten activity when they investigated threat-intelligence efforts that \u201cincluded pivoting on an IP address (162.55.136[.]20) that was already attributed to Iranian threat actors by multiple sources, including US CERT,\u201d Frank explained.The team took a deeper dive into different files that were downloaded from the IP address and discovered a treasure trove of novel tools as well as links to Memento ransomware, he said.Charming Kitten is now using what researchers have dubbed PowerLess Backdoor, a previously undocumented PowerShell trojan that supports downloading additional payloads, such as a keylogger and an info stealer.The team also discovered a unique new PowerShell execution process related to the backdoor aimed at slipping past security-detection products, Frank wrote.\u201cThe PowerShell code runs in the context of a .NET application, thus not launching \u2018powershell.exe\u2019 which enables it to evade security products,\u201d he wrote.Overall, the new tools show Charming Kitten developing more \u201cmodular, multi-staged malware\u201d with payload-delivery aimed at \u201cboth stealth and efficacy,\u201d Frank noted. The group also is leaning heavily on open-source tools such as cryptography libraries, weaponizing them for payloads and communication encryption, he said.This reliance on open-source tools demonstrates that the APT\u2019s developers likely lack \u201cspecialization in any specific coding language\u201d and possess \u201cintermediate coding skills,\u201d Frank observed.The Memento ConnectionCybereason Nocturnus also found that another IP that US CERT has linked to Charming Kitten,91.214.124[.]143, has been communicating with malicious files and has \u201cunique URL directory patterns that reveal a potential connection to Memento ransomware,\u201d Frank wrote.\u201cThe string \u2018gsdhdDdfgA5sS\u2019 appears to be generated by the same script as the one listed in the Memento ransomware IOCs \u2013 \u201cgadfTs55sghsSSS\u201d \u2013 he explained, citing specific directory activity that researchers observed. \u201cThe domain \u2018google.onedriver-srv[.]ml\u2019 was previously resolved to the IP address 91.214.124[.]143 mentioned in the US CERT alert about Iran state-sponsored actors activity.\u201dAnalyzing this directory activity points to the IP potentially serving as a domain being used as command and control (C2) for Memento, researchers found.Indeed, this connection makes sense when noting that Charming Kitten\u2019s activity last year to exploit the ProxyShell vulnerability \u2013 an RCE flaw in Microsoft Exchange servers that suffered a barrage of attacks \u2013 \u201ctook place in about the same time frame as Memento,\u201d Frank observed.\u201cIranian threat actors were also reported to be turning to ransomware during that period, which strengthens the hypothesis that Memento is operated by an Iranian threat actor,\u201d he wrote.Organizations on AlertCharming Kitten\u2019s continuous evolution of its capabilities has been well-documented, so its new tools and potential to branch out in terms of the type of attacks it can deliver should come as little surprise.Indeed, threat groups in general are just like any legitimate businesses in that they must bob and weave constantly to meet business objectives, especially when old tactics don\u2019t serve them anymore or authorities are on to them, noted one security professional.\u201cCybercriminals, like any business, work to evolve their software to improve, evolve and scale to bring about the best results needed to be successful,\u201d observed James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.In the same way, organizations need to constantly be on their toes and create \u201ca strong security culture\u201d so they aren\u2019t caught unawares by novel tactics used by APTs like Charming Kitten and other highly organized threat groups, he said.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A brand-new multiplatform malware, likely distributed via malicious npm packages, is spreading under the radar with Linux and Mac versions going fully undetected in VirusTotal, researchers warned.The Windows version, according to a Tuesday writeup from Intezer, has only six detections as of this writing. These were uploaded to VirusTotal with the suffix \u201c.ts,\u201d which is used for TypeScript files.Dubbed SysJoker by Intezer, the backdoor is used for establishing initial access on a target machine. Once installed, it can execute follow-on code as well as additional commands, through which malicious actors can carry out follow-on attacks or pivot to move further into a corporate network. This kind of initial access is also a hot commodity on underground cyberforums, where ransomware groups and others can purchase it.It was first seen in December during a cyberattack on a Linux-based web server of a \u201cleading educational institution,\u201d researchers said. Looking at its command-and-control (C2) domain registration and other sample data, this trickster appears to have been cooked up in the second half of 2021, they added.A possible attack vector for SysJoker is an infected npm package, according to Intezer\u2019s analysis \u2013 an increasingly popular vector for dropping malware on targets. Npm and other public code repositories are centralized developer communities where coders can upload and download building blocks for building applications. If one of these building blocks is malicious, it can be pulled into any number of apps, ready to strike any users of those infected projects.SysJoker\u2019s Infection RoutineOnce it finds a target, SysJoker masquerades as a system update, researchers said, to avoid suspicion. Meanwhile, it generates its C2 by decoding a string retrieved from a text file hosted on Google Drive.\u201cDuring our analysis the C2 has changed three times, indicating the attacker is active and monitoring infected machines,\u201d researchers noted in the report. \u201cBased on victimology and malware\u2019s behavior, we assess that SysJoker is after specific targets.\u201dSysJoker\u2019s behavior is similar for all three operating systems, according to Intezer, with the exception that the Windows version makes use of a first-stage dropper.After execution, SysJoker sleeps for a random amount of time, between a minute and a half and two minutes. Then, it will create the C:\\ProgramData\\SystemData\\ directory and copy itself there using the file name \u201cigfxCUIService.exe\u201d \u2013 in other words, it masquerades as the Intel Graphics Common User Interface Service.After gathering system information (mac address, user name, physical media serial number and IP address), it collects the data into a temporary text file.\u201cThese text files are deleted immediately, stored in a JSON object and then encoded and written to a file named \u2018microsoft_Windows.dll,'\u201d researchers noted.SysJoker will then establish persistence by adding an entry to the registry run key \u201cHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.\u201d Between each of these stages of infection, it sleeps for a random period of time.Establishing C2 CommunicationTo establish a connection with the C2, SysJoker first decodes a hardcoded Google Drive link using a hardcoded XOR key, researchers observed. It uses the same key to encrypt information sent back and forth to and from the C2, they added.That Google Drive link opens a text file named \u201cdomain.txt\u201d that holds an encoded C2 (the address changes dynamically according to server availability). The link decodes the C2 and sends the previously collected machine fingerprinting data over, according to the analysis. The C2 replies with a unique token \u2013 an identifier for that particular infection that it will use to ping the C2 for instructions.SysJoker CommandsSysJoker can receive various commands, including \u201cexe,\u201d \u201ccmd,\u201d \u201cremove_reg\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d \u2013 only two of which were enabled at the time of Intezer\u2019s analysis.\u201cremove_reg and exit are not implemented in this current version,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cBased on the instruction names, we can assume that they are in charge of self deletion of the malware.\u201dThe exe command is in charge of dropping and running an executable.\u201cSysJoker will receive a URL to a .ZIP file, a directory for the path the file should be dropped to and a filename that the malware should use on the extracted executable,\u201d according to Intezer. \u201cIt will download this file, unzip it and execute it.\u201dAfter execution, the malware will reply \u201csuccess\u201d if the file was successfully installed or \u201cexception\u201d if not.The cmd command is for running next-stage instructions.\u201cSysJoker will decode the command, execute it and upload the command\u2019s response to the C2 via /api/req/res API,\u201d researchers explained. \u201c[But] during our analysis, the C2 hasn\u2019t responded with a next stage instruction.\u201dHow to Detect & Mitigate SysJoker MalwareEven though VirusTotal detections are low to non-existent for SysJoker, Intezer provided some tips for determining whether it has jested its way onto a network.Users or admins can first use memory scanners to detect a SysJoker payload in memory. They can also use detection content to search endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security information and event management (SIEM) platforms (Intezer\u2019s post has rich indicators of compromise and other data to help with this).If a compromise is detected, victims can take the following steps, according to the firm:Kill the processes related to SysJoker, delete the relevant persistence mechanism and all files related to SysJoker.Make sure that the infected machine is clean by running a memory scanner.Investigate the initial entry point of the malware.

Analysis of the new malware suggests that we may not have heard the last from the Nobelium advanced persistent threat (APT) behind the sprawling SolarWinds supply-chain attacks of 2020.Namely, Tomiris has a number of similarities to the Sunshuttle second-stage malware (aka GoldMax) that was distributed by Nobelium (aka DarkHalo). That\u2019s according to a report presented at the virtual Security Analyst Summit (SAS) 2021 on Wednesday, from Kaspersky researchers Pierre Delcher and Ivan Kwiatkowski.Nobelium also isn\u2019t the only APT that could have links to the malware; the researchers said that the targeting of the Tomiris campaign shows a number of overlaps with Kazuar, a backdoor linked to the Turla APT, first reported by Palo Alto in 2017 (though its development goes back to 2015).History Repeats Itself: SolarWinds Keeps BlowingAs the researchers noted, news of the SolarWinds attacks rocked the world last December.The espionage attacks started with SolarWinds, a major U.S. IT firm, spread to its clients, and went undetected for months. The attackers, believed by some U.S. officials to be backed by Russia, spied on private companies that included cybersecurity firm FireEye, Microsoft and up to 10 federal government departments, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Treasury Department.The Sunburst malware, aka Solorigate, was the tip of the spear in the campaign, in which adversaries were able to use SolarWinds\u2019 Orion network management platform to infect targets. The campaign pushed Sunburst out via trojanized product updates to almost 18,000 organizations around the globe. Once Sunburst was embedded, the attackers proceeded to pick and choose which organizations to further penetrate, ultimately resulting in about 100 compromised organizations.By the time that FireEye first discovered the campaign in December, Nobelium was believed to have already been working on it for over a year. Evidence indicates that the APT spent six months inside the Orion networks as the threat actor polished the attack.The first malicious update, which contained the Sunburst malware, was pushed to SolarWinds users in March 2020. \u201cWe can only assume that DarkHalo [Nobelium] leveraged this access to collect intelligence until the day they were discovered,\u201d the Kaspersky researchers explained in their report, which provided the following timeline of the SolarWinds campaign:SolarWinds timeline. Source: Kaspersky.Leaks and Family LikenessesWhen it all came to light in December, Kaspersky researchers discovered two things: First, that the malware\u2019s DNS-based protocol leaked the identity of about 100 victims who downloaded the trojanized package containing the Sunburst backdoor \u2013 victims that Nobelium planned to further exploit, including a U.S. government organization and a large U.S. telecom.A month after that, Kaspersky uncovered similarities between Sunburst and the Kazuar backdoor, which Palo Alto linked to Turla. Turla, aka Snake, Venomous Bear, Waterbug or Uroboros, is a Russian-speaking APT known since 2014, but with roots that go back to 2004 and earlier, according to previous research from Kaspersky.Last March, FireEye and Microsoft released more details about Sunshuttle/GoldMax. A few months later, in May, Microsoft attributed a spear-phishing attack to Nobelium, but by that time, the trail had gone cold. It looked like Nobelium had slipped under the radar: There were no major discoveries of incidents attributable to Nobelium following Sunburst.Detecting More Glimmers From NobeliumBut in June, more than six months after Nobelium went dark, Kaspersky picked up on a DNS hijacking of multiple government zones of a CIS member state that allowed the threat actor to redirect traffic from government mail servers to machines they controlled: a feat it pulled off likely after obtaining credentials to the control panel of the victims\u2019 registrar.The takeover was hard to detect, Delcher and Kwiatkowski said: \u201cWhile the malicious redirections were active, visitors were directed to webmail login pages that mimicked the original ones,\u201d according to their analysis. \u201cDue to the fact that the attackers controlled the various domain names they were hijacking, they were able to obtain legitimate SSL certificates from Let\u2019s Encrypt for all these fake pages, making it very difficult for non-educated visitors to notice the attack \u2013 after all, they were connecting to the usual URL and landed on a secure page.\u201dIt was all quite convincing: When targets tried to access their corporate email, they were redirected to a fake copy of its web interface, shown below. After that, they were tricked into downloading a malicious software update.Malicious webmail login page set up by the attackers. Source: Kaspersky.When Kaspersky researchers traced the attackers\u2019 path, they found that the purported update was actually a previously unknown backdoor: Tomiris, a backdoor designed to establish a foothold in compromised systems that could be used to download additional, as yet unidentified malware.Tomiris proved suspiciously similar to the Sunshuttle/GoldMax second-stage malware that was deployed by the Sunburst backdoor in the SolarWinds attacks.This is an incomplete list of similarities Kaspersky noted between Tomiris and Sunshuttle:Just like Sunshuttle, Tomiris was developed in the Go programming languageEach backdoor uses a single encryption/obfuscation scheme to encode both configurations and network trafficBoth rely on scheduled tasks for persistence, use randomness and sleep delays to hide their activitiesThe general workflow of the two programs, in particular the way features are distributed into functions, look similar enough that Kaspersky analysts suggest they could be indicative of shared development practicesEnglish mistakes were found in both Tomiris (\u2018isRunned\u2019) and Sunshuttle (\u2018EXECED\u2019 instead of \u2018executed\u2019) strings, which points to both malicious programs being created by people that do not speak English natively (It\u2019s widely acknowledged that the Nobelium actor is Russian-speaking)The Tomiris backdoor was discovered in networks where other machines were infected with Kazuar \u2013 the backdoor which is known for its code overlaps with the Sunburst backdoor\u2018Tell Us We\u2019re Right/Wrong\u2019Kaspersky is eager for other researchers to confirm or challenge its suspicions. \u201cNone of these items, taken individually, is enough to link Tomiris and Sunshuttle with sufficient confidence,\u201d Delcher said in a press release. \u201cWe freely admit that a number of these data points could be accidental, but still feel that taken together they at least suggest the possibility of common authorship or shared development practices.\u201dAt the SAS conference, Delcher said that if the researchers haven\u2019t exactly picked up on the work of the developers behind SolarWinds, they have at least spotted work from developers that share common development practices.\u201cAll in all, it feels like we are just missing one piece of evidence to be able to wrap up all the standards together with a high degree of certainty,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really starting to look like a duck and quacks like a duck, [but] in my opinion \u2026 we are not exactly there yet.\u201dThe researchers have found clues that may indicate that the Tomiris backdoor authors might be Russian speaking. That\u2019s not enough to make a solid link to the SolarWinds attackers, but looking at the timeline, the Tomiris campaign did in fact drop soon after the discovery of Sunburst/Solorigate, which feels significant to the researchers.\u00a0\u201cI estimate that Tomiris development started around December 2020, right after the SolarWinds incident blew up,\u201d Delcher said. \u201cRight after the discovery of Solarigate, the attackers dropped this campaign and then they moved on to something new. They registered domains and then nothing happened until late January. And while they\u2019re doing this \u2026 they might [have been] rebuilding [their] capabilities.\u201d\u00a0Also in the press release, Kwiatkowski added that if Kasperskiy\u2019s guess about Tomiris and Sunshuttle being connected is on target, \u201cIt would shed new light on the way threat actors rebuild capacities after being caught.\u00a0He invited others in the cybersecurity industry to weigh in: \u201cWe would like to encourage the threat intelligence community to reproduce this research and provide second opinions about the similarities we discovered between Sunshuttle and Tomiris.\u201d092921 14:38 UPDATE: Added comments from Pierre Delcher\u2019s presentation at SAS 2021.Rule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

        "raw text": "The threat actors behind the notorious SolarWinds supply-chain attacks have dispatched new malware to steal data and maintain persistence on victims\u2019 networks, researchers have found.Researchers from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) have observed the APT it calls Nobelium using a post-exploitation backdoor dubbed FoggyWeb, to attack Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers. AD FS enables single sign-on (SSO) across cloud-based apps in a Microsoft environment, by sharing digital identity and entitlements rights.The attacks started as far back as April, Ramin Nafisi from MSTIC wrote in a blog post published Monday.Nobelium is employing \u201cmultiple tactics to pursue credential theft\u201d to gain admin privileges to AD FS servers, Nafisi wrote. Then, once a server is compromised, the threat group deploys FoggyWeb \u201cto remotely exfiltrate the configuration database of compromised AD FS servers, decrypted token-signing certificates\u00a0and token-decryption certificates,\u201d he said, which can be used to penetrate into users\u2019 cloud accounts.In addition to remotely exfiltrating sensitive data, FoggyWeb also achieves persistence and communicates with a a command-and-control (C2) server to receive additional malicious components and execute them, Nafisi added.Backdoor BreakdownNafisi provides a thorough breakdown of the sophisticated FoggyWeb backdoor, which operates by allowing abuse of the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) token in AD FS, he explained in the post.\u201cThe backdoor configures HTTP listeners for actor-defined URIs that mimic the structure of the legitimate URIs used by the target\u2019s AD FS deployment,\u201d Nafisi wrote. \u201cThe custom listeners passively monitor all incoming HTTP GET and POST requests sent to the AD FS server from the intranet/internet and intercept HTTP requests that match the custom URI patterns defined by the actor.\u201dAttackers store the malware in an encrypted file called Windows.Data.TimeZones.zh-PH.pri, while the malicious file version.dll acts as a loader. The DLL file leverages the CLR hosting interfaces and APIs to load FoggyWeb, a managed DLL, in the same Application Domain within which legitimate AD FS managed code is executed.In this way, FoggyWeb gains access to the AD FS codebase and resources, including the AD FS configuration database. The malware also inherits AD FS service account permissions that are required to access the AD FS configuration database, Nafisis wrote.Additionally, \u201cbecause FoggyWeb is loaded into the same application domain as the AD FS managed code, it gains programmatical access to the legitimate AD FS classes, methods, properties, fields, objects and components that are subsequently leveraged by FoggyWeb to facilitate its malicious operations,\u201d he added.Moreover, FoggyWeb is also AD FS version-agnostic, which means it doesn\u2019t need to keep track of legacy versus modern configuration table names and schemas, named pipe names and other version-dependent properties of AD FS, Nafisi wrote.Malware MitigationMicrosoft has notified all customers observed being targeted or compromised by FoggyWeb, as well as included a comprehensive list of compromise indicators in the post.The company also has recommended several mitigation actions for organizations, including: Auditing of on-premises and cloud infrastructure to identify any changes the actor might have made to maintain access; removing user and app access, reviewing configurations for each, and re-issuing new, strong credentials; and using a hardware security module to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data.Microsoft also is advising that all customers review their AD FS Server configuration and implement whatever changes are needed to secure the systems from attacks.Tracking a Known Threat ActorMicrosoft researchers have been keeping a wary eye on Nobelium since the company got caught up in the SolarWinds attack that was first discovered late last year. They\u2019ve been tracking the threat group\u2019s activity and capabilities, which have expanded as the actors have built and deployed new malware.Since the SolarWinds incident, researchers have observed Nobelium steadily building out its arsenal beyond the Sunburst/Solorigate backdoor and Teardrop malware it initially deployed in that attack, which reached tens of thousands of organizations around the globe (though fewer than 100 were selected by the attackers for actual breach and compromise).The group used malware called Raindrop in those follow-on SolarWinds attacks, then later added GoldMax, GoldFinder and Sibot malware for layered persistence to its toolset.Microsoft researchers also identified EnvyScout, BoomBox, NativeZone and VaporRage as four pieces of malware that were used in a Nobelium email-based attack chain earlier this year.Rule #1 of Linux Security:\u00a0No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.\u00a0JOIN\u00a0Threatpost and Linux security pros at Uptycs for a LIVE roundtable on the\u00a04 Golden Rules of Linux Security.

        "raw text": "The Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) group is back with a new backdoor used to infect systems in Afghanistan, Germany and the U.S., researchers have reported.On Tuesday, Cisco Talos researchers said that they\u2019ve spotted infections they attributed to the Turla group (aka Snake, Venomous Bear, Uroburos and WhiteBear) \u2013 a Russian-speaking APT. Those attacks are \u201clikely\u201d using a stealthy, \u201csecond-chance\u201d backdoor to maintain access to infected devices, they noted.\u201cSecond-chance,\u201d as in, it\u2019s sticky: Even if an infected machine supposedly gets wiped clean of the primary malware, the attackers can maintain access to the system.The novel backdoor, dubbed TinyTurla, can be used to drop payloads and to upload and/or execute files, according to the writeup. It could also be used as a second-stage dropper to infect the system with additional malware.\u201cThe backdoor code is quite simple but is efficient enough that it will usually fly under the radar,\u201d according to the report.How TinyTurla TiptoesCisco Talos said that the attackers have installed TinyTurla as a service disguised as \u201cWindows Time Service,\u201d mimicking the legitimate Windows service that\u2019s used to synchronize the date and time for systems running in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).TinyTurla also mimics the legitimate Windows Time service in its ability to upload, execute or exfiltrate files. The backdoor contacts a command-and-control (C2) server via an HTTPS encrypted channel every five seconds to check for new commands, the researchers explained.Due to TinyTurla\u2019s limited functionality and its simple coding, anti-malware tools have a tough time detecting that it\u2019s malware, the researchers said. That helps to explain why it hasn\u2019t been identified yet, even though adversaries have deployed it since \u201cat least 2020.\u201d\u201cTurla is well-known and closely monitored by the security industry. Nevertheless, they managed to use this backdoor for almost two years,\u201d Cisco Talos stressed. \u201cThis clearly shows that there is room for improvement on the defensive side.\u201dHowever, that five-second anomalous blip in network traffic can be sniffed out by some defense systems, they noted, showing \u201ca great example of how important it is to incorporate network behavior-based detection into your security approach.\u201dHow TinyTurla TwirlsThe attackers used a .BAT file that installs TinyTurla as an innocent-looking, fake Microsoft Windows Time service and which also sets the configuration parameters in the registry used by the backdoor. Below is a screenshot shared by Cisco Talos, redacted to remove the original C2 IP addresses \u201cdue to ongoing investigations.\u201dC2 IP addresses removed due to ongoing investigations. Source: Cisco Talos.Cisco Talos researchers said that the malware\u2019s DLL ServiceMain startup function doesn\u2019t do much beyond executing a function they called \u201cmain_malware\u201d that includes the backdoor code. They called the dynamic link library (DLL) \u201cpretty simple\u201d: It consists of just a few functions and two \u201cwhile\u201d loops, including \u201cthe whole malware logic.\u201dThe researchers noted that while Turla often uses sophisticated malware, the group also uses \u201cgood enough\u201d malware like this to fly under the radar.The APT actor isn\u2019t perfect, though, and has make mistakes on the detection front: \u201cTalos has monitored many noisy Turla operations, for example,\u201d the report continued. \u201cDuring their campaigns, they are often using and re-using compromised servers for their operations, which they access via SSH, often protected by Tor. One public reason why we attributed this backdoor to Turla is the fact that they used the same infrastructure as they used for other attacks that have been clearly attributed to their Penguin Turla infrastructure.\u201dThat infrastructure is old: In the Penguin Turla attacks of 2011, disclosed by Kaspersky Lab in 2014, Linux machines were targeted with a backdoor based on the open-source LOKI2 backdoor that was released in Phrack magazine in September 1997.)Who Is Turla?The Turla APT has roots that go back to 2004 and earlier, according to research from Kaspersky. In January, the firm suggested that Turla malware may have been used in the SolarWinds blitzkrieg, given that Kaspersky researchers found code similarities between the Sunburst backdoor used in that sprawling series of supply-chain attacks and the Kazuar backdoor attributed to Turla.At the time, Kaspersky described Turla as \u201ca complex cyberattack platform focused predominantly on diplomatic and government-related targets, particularly in the Middle East, Central and Far East Asia, Europe, North and South America, and former Soviet-bloc nations.\u201dThe APT has developed a huge arsenal of tools to do so. Besides being potentially tied to the Sunburst backdoor used in SolarWinds, Turla has also been linked to well-known malware like Crutch \u2013 which leveraged Dropbox in espionage attacks against European Union countries last December \u2013 and, again, with the Kazuar backdoor, described in 2017 by Palo Alto Networks as a multiplatform espionage backdoor with API access.Cisco Talos noted that monitoring of Russian-speaking actors; technical evidence; and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) all help to trace things back to Turla in this latest case.\u201cBy tracking these plus political interests, it\u2019s often possible to attribute certain campaigns and toolsets to this actor,\u201d the researchers wrote.Used to Target Afghan GovernmentCisco Talos first unearthed the TinyTurla backdoor when it was used to target Afghanistan in the leadup to the Taliban\u2019s coup and the pullout of Western military might. It assesses with \u201cmoderate confidence\u201d that the malware was used to target the former Afghan government.It\u2019s a case study in how malicious services can slip by unnoticed in the crowd of legitimate services constantly running in the background, according to the writeup.\u201cIt\u2019s often difficult for an administrator to verify that all running services are legitimate,\u201d the report explained, reiterating the need for network monitoring that can alert security teams to these infections. \u201cIt is important to have software and/or automated systems detecting unknown running services and a team of skilled professionals who can perform a proper forensic analysis on potentially infected systems,\u201d researchers said.Cisco Talos concluded by urging adoption of a multi-layered security architecture to detect these kinds of attacks. \u201cIt isn\u2019t unlikely that the adversaries will manage to bypass one or the other security measures, but it is much harder for them to bypass all of them,\u201d researchers forecasted.They said they expect Turla campaigns \u2013 along with further refinement of the TTPs being used \u2013 as likely to continue \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201dRule #1 of Linux Security: No cybersecurity solution is viable if you don\u2019t have the basics down.

        "raw text": "The novel backdoor technique called SideWalk, seen in campaigns targeting US media and retailers late last month, has been tied to an adversary that\u2019s been around for quite a while: namely, China-linked Grayfly espionage group.ESET researchers, who named and discovered the new \u201cSparklingGoblin\u201d advanced persistent threat (APT) actor behind SideWalk, reported at the time that the group is an offshoot of another APT \u2013 Winnti Group \u2013 first identified in 2013 by Kaspersky.ESET also said that the SideWalk backdoor is similar to one used by Winnti (aka APT41, Barium, Wicked Panda or Wicked Spider, an APT known for nation state-backed cyberespionage and financial cybercrime) called CrossWalk (Backdoor.Motnug). Both CrossWalk and SideWalk are modular backdoors used to exfiltrate system information and can run shellcode sent by the command-and-control (C2) server.According to a report published by Symantec on Thursday, the SideWalk malware has been deployed in recent Grayfly campaigns against organizations in Taiwan, Vietnam, the US and Mexico. Symantec\u2019s Threat Hunter Team has observed recent campaigns that have involved exploits targeting Exchange and MySQL servers.Besides attacking organizations in the IT, media and finance sectors, the group also has zeroed in on the telecoms sector, according to the report.Indicted but UndeterredThe US indicted several members of APT41 in September 2020, all of them Chinese residents and nationals. A Federal grand jury charged them with pulling off dozens of crimes, including allegedly facilitating \u201d the theft of source code, software code-signing certificates, customer-account data and valuable business information,\u201d which in turn \u201cfacilitated other criminal schemes, including ransomware and cryptojacking.\u201dAs the Department of Justice (DOJ) said at the time, one of the defendants \u2013 Jiang Lizhi \u2013 allegedly bragged about having a \u201cworking relationship\u201d with the Chinese Ministry of State Security: a relationship that would give him and his alleged co-conspirators a degree of state protection.According to Symantec researchers, the SideWalk campaign suggests that the arrests and the publicity can\u2019t have made much of a dent in the group\u2019s activity.Pesky GrayflyYou might know Grayfly better by its also-known-as\u2019s, which include GREF and Wicked Panda. Symantec said that even though the Grayfly APT is sometimes labeled APT41, its researchers consider Grayfly to be a distinct arm of APT41 that\u2019s devoted to espionage. This is similar to how Symantec separately tracks other sub-groups of APT41, such as Blackfly, the APT\u2019s cybercrime arm.Grayfly, a targeted attack group, has been around since at least March 2017, using the CrossWalk/Backdoor.Motnug (aka TOMMYGUN) backdoor. The group has also wielded a custom loader called Trojan.Chattak, Cobalt Strike (aka Trojan.Agentemis, the legitimate, commercially available tool used by network penetration testers and, increasingly, by crooks) and ancillary tools in its attacks.Researchers have seen Grayfly targeting a number of countries in Asia, Europe, and North America across a variety of industries, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing and telecommunications. Recently, it\u2019s continued to torment telecoms, but it\u2019s also been going after the media, finance and IT service providers.Grayfly\u2019s typical modus operandi is to target publicly facing web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion before spreading further within the network, Symantec said. After it has penetrated a network, Grayfly then might install its custom backdoors onto more systems. That gives the operators remote access to the network and proxy connections that enable them to access hard-to-reach segments of a target\u2019s network, according to the writeup.Walking the Slippery SideWalk Symantec researchers observed that in the recent SideWalk campaign, Grayfly looked to be particularly interested in attacking exposed Microsoft Exchange or MySQL servers, suggesting that \u201cthe initial vector may be the exploit of multiple vulnerabilities against public-facing servers.\u201dIn fact, the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recently put out an urgent alert about a surge in ProxyShell attacks, as attackers launched 140 web shells against 1,900 unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers. Security researchers at Huntress reported seeing ProxyShell vulnerabilities being actively exploited throughout the month of August to install backdoor access once the ProxyShell exploit code was published on Aug. 6: A few weeks later, the surge hit.In at least one of the SideWalk attacks that Symantec researchers observed, the suspicious Exchange activity was followed by PowerShell commands used to install an unidentified web shell. That may sound familiar, given that one of the vulnerabilities Huntress described last month was CVE-2021-34523: a bug that enables malicious actors to execute arbitrary code post-authentication on Microsoft Exchange servers due to a flaw in the PowerShell service not properly validating access tokens.The Grayfly attackers executed the malicious SideWalk backdoor after the web shell was installed. Then, they deployed a tailor-made version of the open-source, credential-dumping tool Mimikatz that Symantec said has been used in earlier Grayfly attacks. Symantec\u2019s report does a deep dive on the technical details, including indicators of compromise.Expect more to come, researchers said, since this fly isn\u2019t likely to buzz off: \u201cGrayfly is a capable actor, likely to continue to pose a risk to organizations in Asia and Europe across a variety of industries, including telecommunications, finance, and media. It\u2019s likely this group will continue to develop and improve its custom tools to enhance evasion tactics along with using commodity tools such as publicly available exploits and web shells to assist in their attacks.\u201dIt\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.

It\u2019s been active since at least January 2016, but it periodically pops in and out of dormancy in order to fine-tune tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) and thereby evade detection and ramp up its success rate.True to form, in March, Bitdefender spotted FIN8 re-emerging after a period of relative quiet with a new version of the BadHatch backdoor to compromise companies in the chemical, insurance, retail and technology industries. Sardonic is an updated version of BadHatch that\u2019s apparently still under development, Bitdefender said.It\u2019s a refinement of BadHatch in that it can be automatically boosted with new functionality without the malware needing to be redeployed: A way to make it more agile, Bitdefender said.Bogdan Botezatu, director of threat research for Bitdefender, told BankInfoSecurity that the security firm has seen FIN8 carrying out two attacks over the past few months, what he called \u201cunusually high activity for a threat actor that used to take long breaks between attacks.\u201dBesides BadHatch \u2013 a backdoor that provides file transfer and reverse-shell functionality \u2013 FIN8\u2019s well-stocked arsenal has included malware variants such as ShellTea, a backdoor also known as PunchBuggy, and the memory-scraper tool PoSlurp/PunchTrack. FIN8 has also used the TTPs of exploiting Windows zero-days and spear-phishing.Bitdefender isn\u2019t sure what the initial infection vector was on the thwarted bank attack, but based on FIN8\u2019s prior attacks, it was likely via social engineering and spear-phishing campaigns.FIN8 attack anatomy. Source: Bitdefender.Sardonic Still Being RefinedAnd now, there\u2019s Sardonic. Earlier this week, Bitdefender published a deep dive describing a forensic investigation that led to the discovery of the new backdoor. Artifacts led researchers to conclude that the threat actors use that name to describe \u201can entire project including the backdoor itself, the loader and some additional scripts,\u201d according to Bitdefender.Sardonic is apparently still under development, and Bitdefender suspects that the threat actors will be using additional updates still to come.The evolution of BadHatch. Source: Bitdefender.The Two AttacksDuring one of the attacks \u2013 a recent attack against an unidentified financial institution in the U.S. \u2013 FIN8 used a three-stage process to deploy and execute the Sardonic backdoor: A PowerShell script, a .NET loader and downloader shellcode.After it was loaded, Bitdefender said that the embedded dynamic link library obtained the value of the Y1US environment variable and extracted the string that contained options for behavior customization so it could make changes.Bitdefender said that the new backdoor tried to evade security monitoring by using TLS encryption in order to conceal Powershell commands. After it gains network access, FIN8 has used the access to scan for victim networks, give attackers remote access, install a backdoor and deliver other malware payloads.Fending Off Financial MalwareBitdefender recommends that companies in the targeted verticals \u2013 retail, hospitality and finance \u2013 check for potential compromise by applying the indicators of compromise (IoCs) listed in its whitepaper (PDF), and implementing endpoint detection and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR) and other security defenses.Bitdefender offered these protective measures:Separate the PoS network from the ones used by employees or guestsIntroduce cybersecurity awareness training for employees to help them spot phishing e-mails.Tune your e-mail security solution to automatically discard malicious or suspicious attachments.Integrate threat intelligence into existing SIEM or security controls for relevant indicators of compromise.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Apple provided additional design and security details this week about the planned rollout of a feature aimed at detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) images stored in iCloud Photos.Privacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation warned that the process of flagging CSAM images essentially narrows the definition of end-to-end encryption to allow client-side access \u2014 which essentially means Apple is building a backdoor into its data storage, it said.\u201cApple can explain at length how its technical implementation will preserve privacy and security in its proposed backdoor, but at the end of the day, even a thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly scoped backdoor is still a backdoor,\u201d The EFF said in reaction to the Apple announcement.Apple\u2019s new document explained that the tool is only available to child accounts set up in Family Sharing and the parent or guardian must opt-in. Then, a machine-learning classifier is deployed to the device in the messaging app, which will trigger a warning if the app detects explicit images being sent to or from the account. If the account is for a child under 13 years old, the parent or guardian will also receive a notification, according to Apple.\u00a0 The image is not shared with the parent, only a notification, Apple added.Apple Explains How It Protects Privacy While Monitoring CSAM Content \u00a0\u201cThis feature does not reveal information to Apple,\u201d the company said. \u201cSpecifically, it does not disclose the communications of the users, the actions of the child or the notifications to the parents. It does not compare images to any database, such as a database of CSAM material. It never generates any reports for Apple or law enforcement.\u201dThe feature also detects collections of CSAM images uploaded to iCloud photos, Apple said. First it runs code on the device that compares any photo being uploaded to a known database of CSAM images.\u201cThe iCloud photo servers can decrypt the safety vouchers corresponding to positive matches \u2014 if and only if that user\u2019s iCloud Photos account exceeds a certain number of matches, called the match threshold,\u201d Apple added.After a certain number of images is detected, the images are sent to a human reviewer and if an issue is detected, the information is turned over to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children who will notify law enforcement as necessary.\u201cThe system is designed so that a user need not trust Apple, any other single entity, or even any set of possibly colluding entities from the same sovereign jurisdiction (that is, under the control of the same government) to be confident that the system is functioning as advertised,\u201d Apple said.First, Apple said it generated a CSAM device database by combining information from two separate child-safety agencies.\u201cAny perceptual hashes appearing in only one participating child-safety organization\u2019s database, or only in databases from multiple agencies in a single sovereign jurisdiction, are discarded by this process, and not included in the encrypted CSAM database that Apple includes in the operating system,\u201d Apple\u2019s document explained. \u201cThis mechanism meets our source-image correctness requirement.\u201dThe company added that the database is never updated or shared over the internet.\u201cSince no remote updates of the database are possible, and since Apple distributes the same signed operating system image to all users worldwide, it is not possible \u2013 inadvertently or through coercion \u2013 for Apple to provide targeted users with a different CSAM database,\u201d the company explained. \u201cThis meets our database update transparency and database universality requirements.\u201dApple added that it will publish a Knowledge Base article with a root hash of the encrypted database with each iOS update, to allow for independent third-party technical audits.It\u2019s unclear how any of these details will reassure critics of the move.\u201cWhile Apple aims at the scourge of child exploitation and abuse, the company has created an infrastructure that is all too easy to redirect to greater surveillance and censorship,\u201d the EFF said in response. \u201cThe program will undermine Apple\u2019s defense that it can\u2019t comply with the broader demands.\u201dWorried about where the next attack is coming from?

        "raw text": "Financial cybercrime gang FIN7 has rebounded after the jailing of some key members, launching a campaign that uses as a lure a legal complaint involving the liquor company that owns Jack Daniels whiskey. The gambit successfully compromised at least one law firm, giving them a shot of the JSSLoader remote-access trojan (RAT), researchers said.According to eSentire\u2019s Threat Response Unit (TRU), the successful breach for FIN7 (aka Carbanak Group or Navigator Group) was part of a wider, non-targeted email campaign. It purports to relate to a legal complaint centering around liquor giant Brown-Forman.\u201cOne of the victims of the malicious legal complaint campaign was a law firm,\u201d researchers said in a posting this week. \u201cThe lure successfully bypassed the law firm\u2019s email filters, and it was not detected as suspicious by any of the firm\u2019s employees.\u201dThe ultimate purpose of installing the backdoor is unclear. FIN7 usually carries out targeted attacks on point-of-sale systems at casual-dining restaurants, casinos and hotels; or, it infiltrates systems to steal bank-card data and sell it. Since 2020, it has also added ransomware/data exfiltration attacks to its mix, carefully selecting targets according to revenue using the ZoomInfo service.\u201cIt is plausible that proficient financial cybercrime groups, such as FIN7, are providing initial access to seasoned ransomware groups, such as REvil (aka Sodinokibi), Ryuk, etc. as a way to monetize their access,\u201d according to TRU.Savvy Email LuresThe lawsuit campaign was geared to take advantage of a certain amount of zeitgeist, according to the analysis. The messages were sent the first week of June, just one month before settlement claims were due for a real class action suit against Brown-Forman regarding a ransomware breach the company suffered last August.\u201cThe infamous REvil gang took credit for the ransomware attack,\u201d according to TRU. \u201cAlthough the company said they were able to disrupt the attack before their data could be encrypted, the REvil gang broadcasted on their blog/leak site that they had access to Brown-Forman\u2019s systems for over a month and stole a terabyte of their company data.\u201dWhile using such a specific lure lawsuit in a wide-scale campaign may seem counterintuitive, it can net lucrative fish, researchers noted.\u201cCorporate users might immediately suspect a random legal complaint, that arrives via email, from a large spirits and wine company,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHowever, law firms deal with legal complaints across industry verticals regularly, so the content would not be considered out of the ordinary. Thus, law firms may be more susceptible to this topic.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the only activity from FIN7 of late; researchers have also observed a campaign using a USPS mail delivery notification lure, and a campaign themed with Windows 11 that delivered the JSSLoader malware.\u201cWhatever the specific intentions of FIN7, they appear to be actively adjusting their lures to maximize campaign success,\u201d according to TRU researchers. \u201cCybercriminals use well-timed lures and try to predict the susceptibility of a theme for their threat campaigns, and they will use lures built around social trends, global crises and routine events.\u201dRobust Cybercriminal InfrastructureDespite the group\u2019s incarceration woes, FIN7\u2019s infrastructure appears to be robust, researchers said, with a network of servers at the ready:The primary download server: browm-forman[.]comIntermediate servers hosting first-stage payloads: opposedent[.]com, jurisdictionious[.]com, halfious[.]com, pigeonious[.]comVictim vetting: fairedale[.]com (\u201cGiven its position in redirection and JavaScript management, its role may be to test whether a visiting computer is a susceptible victim (and not, for example, a security researcher) before redirecting the user to the malicious payload\u201d)Command-and-control domains (C2s) for the first payload: unitious[.]com, injuryless[.]com, deprivationant[.]com, jurisdictionient[.]com, legislationient[.]comTRU recently observed the registration of a new lookalike domain within this web of infrastructure, brown-formam[.]com, on June 9.\u201cWhile in-the-wild use has not been observed, the registration and TLS certificate patterns match the previous landing page,\u201d researchers said. \u201cWe assess this domain will replace the prior one given that it has been exposed publicly.\u201dNotably for the Brown-Forman case, FIN7 threat actors registered the infrastructure months before TRU saw it in action.\u201cEither the attackers were using it for months before eSentire saw the activity, or they weaponized it after a period of time to evade email filtering by newly registered domains. If that is the case, this shows a degree of planning and sophistication on the part of FIN7.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\u00a0BreachMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "An ongoing surveillance operation has been uncovered that targets a Southeast Asian government, researchers said \u2013 using a previously unknown espionage malware.According to Check Point Research, the attack involves spear-phishing emails with malicious Word documents to gain initial access, along with the exploitation of older, known Microsoft Office security vulnerabilities. But most notable, researchers said, is the novel backdoor, which they said has been in development by a Chinese APT for at least three years.The documents were \u201csent to different employees of a government entity in Southeast Asia,\u201d according to the Check Point analysis. \u201cIn some cases, the emails are spoofed to look like they were from other government-related entities. The attachments to these emails are weaponized copies of legitimate looking official documents and use the remote template technique to pull the next stage from the attacker\u2019s server.\u201dThe malicious documents download a template from various URLs, according to the analysis, which are .RTF files embedded with the\u00a0RoyalRoad weaponizer, also known as the 8.t Dropper/RTF exploit builder. RoyalRoad is a tool that researchers have said is\u00a0part of the arsenal of several Chinese APTs, such as Tick, Tonto Team and TA428; it generates weaponized RTF documents that exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft\u2019s\u00a0Equation Editor\u00a0(CVE-2017-11882, CVE-2018-0798 and CVE-2018-0802).The RoyalRoad-generated RTF document contains an encrypted payload and shellcode, according to the analysis.\u201cTo decrypt the payload from the package, the attacker uses the RC4 algorithm with the key 123456, and the resulted DLL file is saved as 5.t in the %Temp% folder,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe shellcode is also responsible for the persistence mechanism \u2013 it creates the scheduled task named Windows Update that should run the exported function StartW from 5.t with rundll32.exe, once a day.\u201dThe .DLL gathers data on the victim\u2019s computer including the OS name and version, user name, MAC addresses of networking adapters and antivirus information. All of the data is encrypted and then sent to the attackers\u2019 command-and-control server (C2) via GET HTTP request method. After that, a multi-stage chain eventually results in the installation of the backdoor module, which is called \u201cVictory.\u201d It \u201cappears to be a custom and unique malware,\u201d according to Check Point.Victory BackdoorThe malware is built to steal information and provide consistent access to the victim. Check Point researchers said it can take screenshots, manipulate files (including creating, deleting, renaming and reading them), gather information on the top-level windows that are open, and shut down the computer.Interestingly, the malware appears to be related to previously developed tools.\u201cSearching for files similar to the final backdoor in the wild, we encountered a set of files that were submitted to VirusTotal in 2018,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cThe files were named by the author as MClient and appear to be part of a project internally called SharpM, according to their PDB paths. Compilation timestamps also show a similar timeframe between July 2017 and June 2018, and upon examination of the files, they were found to be older test versions of our VictoryDll backdoor and its loaders chain.\u201dThe specific implementation of the main backdoor functionality is identical; and, the connection method has the same format, according to the firm. Also, MClient\u2019s connection XOR key and VictoryDll\u2019s initial XOR key are the same.However, there are differences between the two in terms of architecture, functionality and naming conventions. For instance, MClient features a keylogger, which is absent for Victory. And, Victory\u2019s exported function is named MainThread, while in all versions of the MClient variant the export function was named GetCPUID, according to Check Point.\u201cOverall, we can see that in these three years, most of the functionality of MClient and AutoStartup_DLL was preserved and split between multiple components \u2013 probably to complicate the analysis and decrease the detection rates at each stage,\u201d the form said. \u201cWe may also assume that there exist other modules based on the code from 2018 that might be installed by the attacker in the later stages of the attack.\u201dAttributionCheck Point has attributed the campaign to a Chinese APT. One of the clues is that the first-stage C2 servers are hosted by two different cloud services, located in Hong Kong and Malaysia. These are active in only a limited daily window, returning payloads only from 01:00 \u2013 08:00 UTC Monday through Friday, which corresponds with the Chinese workday. Also, Check Point said that the servers went dormant in the period between May 1 and 5 \u2013 which China\u2019s Labor Day holidays.On top of that, the RoyalRoad RTF exploit building kit is a tool of choice among Chinese APT groups; and some test versions of the backdoor contained internet connectivity check with www.baidu.com \u2013 a popular Chinese website.\u201cWe unveiled the latest activity of what seems to be a long-running Chinese operation that managed to stay under the radar for more than three years,\u201d Check Point concluded. \u201cIn this campaign, the attackers utilized the set of Microsoft Office exploits and loaders with anti-analysis and anti-debugging techniques to install a previously unknown backdoor.\u201dJoin Threatpost for \u201cA Walk On The Dark Side: A Pipeline Cyber Crisis Simulation\u201d\u2013 a LIVE interactive demo on\u00a0Wed, June 9 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "A never-before-documented Brazilian banking trojan, dubbed Bizarro, is targeting customers of 70 banks scattered throughout Europe and South America, researchers said.According to an analysis from Kaspersky released Monday, Bizarro is a mobile malware, aimed at capturing online-banking credentials and hijacking Bitcoin wallets from Android users. It spreads via Microsoft Installer packages, which are either downloaded directly by victims from links in spam emails or installed via a trojanized app, according to the analysis.Once installed, it kills all running browser processes to terminate any existing sessions with online banking websites \u2014 so, when a user initiates a mobile banking session, they have to sign back in, allowing the malware to harvest the details. To maximize its success, Bizarro disables autocomplete in the browser, and even surfaces fake popups to snatch two-factor authentication codes, researchers added.Bizarro also has a screen-capturing module.\u201cIt loads the magnification.dll library and gets the address of the deprecated MagSetImageScalingCallback API function,\u201d explained Kaspersky researchers. \u201cWith its help, the trojan can capture the screen of a user and also constantly monitor the system clipboard, looking for a Bitcoin wallet address. If it finds one, it is replaced with a wallet belonging to the malware developers.\u201dAnd finally, Bizarro also has a main backdoor module that is capable of carrying out more than 100 commands, according to the analysis.A Fully Functional Backdoor \u201cThe core component of the backdoor doesn\u2019t start until Bizarro detects a connection to one of the hardcoded online banking systems,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThe malware does this by enumerating all the windows, collecting their names. Whitespace characters, letters with accents (such as \u00f1 or \u00e1) and non-letter symbols such as dashes are removed from the window name strings. If a window name matches one of the hardcoded strings, the backdoor continues starting up.\u201dThe commands fall into a few main camps:Commands that allow the command-and-control (C2) operators to get data about the victim and manage the connection status; for instance, one asks for Bizarro\u2019s version, OS name, computer name, Bizarro\u2019s unique identifier, installed antivirus software and the codename used for the bank that has been accessed.Commands that allow attackers to search for and steal the files located on the victim\u2019s hard drive, and those that allow adversaries to install files on the victim device.Commands that allow attackers to control the user\u2019s mouse and keyboard.Commands that allow the attackers to control the backdoor operation, shut down, restart or destroy the operating system, and limit the functionality of Windows.Commands that log keystrokes.Commands that display various messages that trick users into giving attackers access to bank accounts, including fake popup windows (i.e., messages like \u201cthe data entered is incorrect, please try again\u201d; error messages asking the user to enter a confirmation code; and those that tell the user that their computer needs to be restarted in order to finish a security-related operation).Commands that enable Bizarro to mimic online banking systems. According to Kaspersky, \u201cTo display such messages, Bizarro needs to download a JPEG image that contains the bank logo and instructions the victim needs to follow. These images are stored in the user profile directory in an encrypted form. Before an image is used in a message, it is decrypted with a multi-byte XOR algorithm. As the messages are downloaded from the C2 server, they can be found only on the victims\u2019 machines.\u201dCommands that enable custom messages.\u201cThe custom messages that Bizarro may show are messages that freeze the victim\u2019s machine, thus allowing the attackers to gain some time,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cWhen a command to display a message like this is received, the taskbar is hidden, the screen is greyed out and the message itself is displayed. While the message is shown, the user is unable to close it or open Task Manager. The message itself tells the user either that the system is compromised and thus needs to be updated or that security and browser performance components are being installed. This type of message also contains a progress bar that changes over time.\u201dJoining the T\u00e9trade, Going GlobalBizarro is active in Argentina, Chile, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal and Spain, researchers said. This global spread is typical of a group of banking malware strains originating in Brazil, consisting of Grandoreiro, Guildma, Javali and Melcoz.Collectively known as \u201cthe T\u00e9trade\u201d (translated as \u201ca group of four\u201d) these families employ a range of innovative and sophisticated techniques on the technical side as well. Bizarro is the latest to join the club (which, incidentally, makes the collective group name a bit of a misnomer).Source: KasperskyResearchers said that Bizarro is supported by a fairly extensive operation, which includes using affiliates and recruiting money mules to perform a variety of functions. The various duties include carrying out initial attacks to gain a foothold on victim devices; helping with cashouts to launder ill-gotten funds; and even translation help.\u201cCybercriminals are constantly looking for new ways to spread malware that steals credentials for e-payment and online banking systems,\u201d said Fabio Assolini, security expert at Kaspersky, in a statement. \u201cToday, we witness a game-changing trend in banking malware distribution \u2013 regional actors actively attack users, not only in their region but also around the globe. Implementing new techniques, Brazilian malware families started distributing to other continents, and Bizarro, which targets users from Europe, is the clearest example of this. It should serve as a sign for greater emphasis on the analysis of regional criminals and local threat intelligence, as soon enough it could become a problem of global concern.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "The PHP project on Sunday announced that attackers were able to gain access to its main Git server, uploading two malicious commits, including a backdoor. They were discovered before they went into production.PHP is a widely used open-source scripting language often used for web development. It can be embedded into HTML. The commits were pushed to the php-src repository, thus offering attackers a supply-chain opportunity to infect websites that pick up the malicious code believing it to be legit.Both commits claimed to \u201cfix a typo\u201d in the source code. They were uploaded using the names of PHP\u2019s maintainers, Rasmus Lerdorf and Nikita Popov, according to a message sent by Popov to the project\u2019s mailing list on Sunday. He added that he didn\u2019t think it was simple case of credential theft.\u201cWe don\u2019t yet know how exactly this happened, but everything points towards a compromise of the git.php.net server (rather than a compromise of an individual git account),\u201d he explained.In response to the hack, PHP is moving its servers to GitHub, making them canonical.\u201cWhile investigation is still underway, we have decided that maintaining our own git infrastructure is an unnecessary security risk, and that we will discontinue the git.php.net server,\u201d Popov explained. \u201cInstead, the repositories on GitHub, which were previously only mirrors, will become canonical. This means that changes should be pushed directly to GitHub rather than to git.php.net\u2026This change also means that it is now possible to merge pull requests directly from the GitHub web interface.\u201dHe also noted that PHP is reviewing all of its repositories for any corruption beyond the two commits that were found.\u201cWe are lucky that the malicious commits were detected before reaching production systems,\u201d said Craig Young, principal security researcher at Tripwire, via email. \u201cHad it not been detected, the code could have ultimately poisoned the binary package repositories which countless organizations rely upon and trust. Open-source projects which are self-hosting their code repositories may be at increased risk of this type of supply-chain attack and must have robust processes in place to detect and reject suspicious commits.\u201dWeaponizing the Software Supply ChainMaking use of open-source repositories as a vehicle to compromise websites and applications is not uncommon.In March, for instance, researchers spotted malicious packages targeting internal applications for Amazon, Lyft, Slack and Zillow (among others) inside the npm public code repository \u2014 all of which exfiltrated sensitive information. The packages weaponized a proof-of-concept (PoC) code dependency-confusion exploit that was recently devised by security researcher Alex Birsan to inject rogue code into developer projects.In January meanwhile, three malicious software packages were published to npm, masquerading as legitimate by using brandjacking. Any applications corrupted by the code could steal tokens and other information from Discord users, researchers said.And in December, RubyGems, an open-source package repository and manager for the Ruby web programming language, took two of its software packages offline after they were found to be laced with malware.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)\u00a0MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The FIN8 cyberattack group has resurfaced after a period of relative quiet, researchers have found. The gang is using new versions of the BadHatch backdoor to compromise companies in the chemical insurance, retail and technology industries.The attacks have been seen hitting organizations around the world, mainly in Canada, Italy, Panama, Puerto Rico, South Africa and the United States, according to an analysis from Bitdefender this week.FIN8 is a financially motivated threat group whose typical mode of attack has been to steal payment-card data from point-of-sale (PoS) environments, particularly those of retailers, restaurants and the hotel industry. The group has been active since at least 2016, but its activity is characterized by periods of dormancy.In this case, the last time FIN8 hit targets was mid-2019, according to Bogdan Botezatu, director of threat research at Bitdefender.\u201cThey have been dormant for 18 months (they made big splashes in 2017 and 2019), although they have been running tests on small pools of targets,\u201d he told Threatpost.FIN8 Tests Waters with Limited AttacksSo far, Bitdefender has recently identified specific attacks on seven targets during its monitoring of the command-center infrastructure used in\u00a0previous FIN8 attacks.\u201cWhile this may sound diminutive, FIN8 is known to get back in business with small tests on a limited pool of victims before they go\u00a0broad,\u201d Botezatu told Threatpost. \u201cThis is a mechanism to validate security on a small subset before moving attacks to production.\u201dThere have been other observed pockets of limited testing in 2020, he added.This pilot-program approach usually stems from group refining or adding to its weapons arsenal. And indeed, the latest wave of activity features a new version of the BadHatch backdoor.Over the course of 2020 and this year, there have been three different \u201climited release\u201d campaigns using revamped versions of BadHatch.\u201cThe move from the legacy versions 2.12 to current version 2.14 started in mid-2020 (version 2.14 was deployed during Christmas 2020),\u201d Botezatu said.The Evolving BadHatch MalwareBadHatch is a custom FIN8 malware that was also used in the 2019 attacks. It has now been souped up, with marked improvements in persistence, encryption, information-gathering and the ability to perform lateral movement, according to a Bitdefender analysis released on Wednesday.The latest backdoor version (v. 2.14), for instance, abuses sslip.io \u2013 a service that provides free IP-to-domain mapping to make SSL certificate generation easier. \u00a0BatchHatch is using the encryption to conceal PowerShell commands while in transit. While the service is legitimate and widely used, the malware abuses it in an attempt at evading detection, according to Botezatu.\u201cThis prevents security and some monitoring solutions from identifying and blocking PowerShell scripts during delivery from the command-and-control server (C2),\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cThis is particularly important in achieving stealth and, to a larger degree, persistence.\u201dThe malware has added to its snooping capabilities too, with the ability to learn more about the victim\u2019s network by grabbing screenshots, for instance \u2013 this eventually better allows lateral movement within an organization\u2019s environment.\u201cThe lateral movement part is critical, as it targets POS networks,\u201d explained Botezatu. \u201cThis is because the malware is usually delivered via malicious attachments. The target victim can be anyone on the network and the malware has to jump from one endpoint to another until it reaches the real targets on the network \u2013 POS devices.\u201dThe latest BadHatch version also allows file downloads, which could pave the way for different kinds of attacks in the future, beyond harvesting credit-card data.\u201cBadHatch has always been correlated with POS attacks, but it has extended backdoor capabilities that let operators perform lateral movement and also has the ability to download additional payloads from specified locations,\u201d Botezatu said. \u201cThese payloads can play multiple roles, depending on the attackers\u2019 agenda.\u201dLike most persistent and skilled cybercrime actors, FIN8 operators are constantly refining their tools and tactics \u2013 but they do fall into predictable rhythms. The latest activity is an indication to expect wider attacks soon, according to the researcher.\u201cFIN8 are the apex predators of the financial fraud ecosystem,\u201d Botezatu said. \u201cThey take long breaks to perfect their tools and invest significant resources in circumventing traditional security situations. They are extremely focused on \u2018living off the land\u2019 attacks and only start targeting victims after they have battle-tested their tools.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:March 24:\u00a0Economics of 0-Day Disclosures: The Good, Bad and Ugly (Learn more and register!)April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)BreachMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Commodity malware backdoor SystemBC has evolved to now automate a number of key activities, as well as use the anonymizing Tor platform. These overarching changes make it both easier for cybercriminals to deploy the backdoor, as well as cloak the destination of the command-and-control (C2) traffic.SystemBC, a proxy and remote administrative tool, was first discovered in 2019. Researchers believe it is being used by ransomware-as-a-service affiliates due to it being associated with multiple types of ransomware that are deployed in the same way. Once it\u2019s executed, the backdoor is used by ransomware actors to set up a persistent connection on victim systems.\u201cWhile SystemBC has been around for over a year, we\u2019ve seen both its use and its features continue to evolve,\u201d said Sivagnanam Gn and Sean Gallagher, researchers with Sophos, in a Wednesday analysis. \u201cThe most recent samples of SystemBC carry code that, instead of acting essentially as a virtual private network via a SOCKS5 proxy, uses the Tor anonymizing network to encrypt and conceal the destination of command and control traffic.\u201dResearchers warn that over the past few months they have detected hundreds of attempted SystemBC deployments globally.\u00a0The backdoor has been utilized in recent Ryuk and Egregor ransomware attacks, and has also often been leveraged in combination with post-exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike, they said.SystemBC ProliferationInitially, ransomware groups that leverage SystemBC have been observed first infecting systems using spam or phishing emails. These emails then trick the victim into downloading the Buer loader, QBot, ZLoader or other types of malware, which are used for initial exploitation and lateral movement.From there, attackers then use SystemBC (along with Cobalt Strike, in some cases) in order to scoop up passwords from victim systems \u2013 although in some cases, the SystemBC backdoor was only deployed to servers after attackers gained administrative credentials, and then used it to move deeper into the targeted network, researchers said.SystemBC is used primarily to gain further persistence on the victim system. In what\u2019s now a more automated process, the backdoor can deploy PowerShells; .CMD scripts (A CMD script\u00a0file features one or more commands in plain text format that are executed in order to perform various tasks);\u00a0Windows commands; malicious executables and dynamic link libraries (DLLs).Researchers said, these key activities have been automated now so that operators can launch multiple attacks without the need for hands-on-keyboard activity.\u00a0They are used for further exploitation and the deployment of the final ransomware (which in recent cases have been Ryuk or Egregor).SystemBC UpdatesThe backdoor also acts both as a network proxy for concealed communications; here a primary change exists in how SystemBC has evolved.Before, SystemBC primarily set up SOCKS5 proxies on victim computers, which could then be used by threat actors to tunnel/hide the malicious traffic associated with other malware. A SOCKS5 proxy\u00a0server creates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to another server behind the firewall on the client\u2019s behalf, then exchanges network packets between the client and the actual server.\u201cWith the proxies initialized, the client now begins to retrieve data requested from the C2 via HTTPS,\u201d researchers with Proofpoint said in a\u00a0writeup in 2019, after the malware was discovered. \u201cThe use of SOCKS5 is not a major differentiator; it\u2019s just another potential technology malware authors can use for this purpose and the primary proxy protocol,\u201d they noted at the time.Most of the C2 communications with the more recent versions of SystemBC, however, are over a Tor connection:\u00a0\u201cThe Tor communications element of SystemBC appears to be based on\u00a0mini-Tor, an open-source library for lightweight connectivity to the Tor anonymized network,\u201d said Sophos reserchers. \u201cThe code of mini-Tor isn\u2019t directly duplicated in SystemBC. But the bot\u2019s implementation of the Tor client closely resembles the implementation used in the open-source program, including its extensive use of the Windows Crypto Next Gen (CNG) API\u2019s Base Crypto (BCrypt) functions.\u201dThese changes to the backdoor \u201care likely an effort to make it more difficult to detect the network traffic associated with command and control of SystemBC,\u201d Sophos\u2019\u00a0Gallagher told Threatpost.\u201cI can\u2019t say if it\u2019s more effective to use Tor instead of a SOCKS5 proxy, but it gives the attacker a more obfuscated and encrypted way of sending commands, scripts, and more malware to the bot,\u201d Gallagher explained. \u201cA single SOCKS5 proxy could be quickly blocked, while Tor is more resilient in its routing.\u201dSystemBC proves to be another useful tool for cybercriminals who have been launching increased levels of ransomware attacks. This past year, in fact, ransomware attacks more than doubled year-over-year (up 109 percent).HacksMalware",

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a previously undocumented backdoor and document stealer, which they have linked to the Russian-speaking\u00a0 Turla advanced persistent threat (APT) espionage group.The malware, which researchers call \u201cCrutch,\u201d is able to bypass security measures by abusing legitimate tools \u2013 including the file-sharing service Dropbox \u2013 in order to hide behind normal network traffic. Researchers said that the Crutch toolset has been designed to exfiltrate sensitive documents and other files to Dropbox accounts, which Turla operators control.\u201c[Crutch] was used from 2015 to, at least, early 2020,\u201d said researchers with ESET in a Wednesday analysis. \u201cWe have seen Crutch on the network of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a country of the European Union, suggesting that this malware family is only used against very specific targets, as is common for many Turla tools.\u201dUpon further investigation of the cyberattack on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, researchers found uploaded .zip files to the operator-controlled Dropbox accounts. These .zip files contained commands for the backdoor, which were uploaded to Dropbox by the operators. The backdoor then would read and execute these commands. These commands set the stage for the staging, compression and exfiltration of documents and various files \u2013 including the execution of one tongue-in-cheek command: \u201cmkdir %temp%\\Illbeback.\u201d\u201cWe were able to capture some of the commands sent by the operators to several Crutch v3 instances, which is helpful to understand the goal of the operation,\u201d they said. \u201cThe operators were mainly doing reconnaissance, lateral movement and espionage.\u201dUpdated VariantsResearchers don\u2019t think Crutch is a first-stage backdoor; instead, it is deployed after the attackers already had initially compromised a victim network. They have previously observed first-stage attack vectors (before the deployment of Crutch) that include a first-stage implant, such as the Skipper implant or the PowerShell Empire post-exploitation agent.In its earliest iterations (used from 2015 up to mid-2019), the Crutch architecture included a backdoor that communicated with Dropbox, as well as a second main binary that targeted files on any removable drives that may be on the system. This binary searched for files with specific extensions (including .pdf, .rtf, .doc, .docx) on removable drives and then staged\u00a0the files in an encrypted archive.Then, in a more recent version of Crutch discovered in July 2019, attackers updated the second main binary, so it could now automatically monitor local drives (as well as removable drives).\u201cThe main difference is that it no longer supports backdoor commands. On the other hand, it can automatically upload the files found on local and removable drives to Dropbox storage by using the Windows version of the Wget utility,\u201d said researchers.Turla AttributionESET connected Crutch to the Turla APT due to what researchers called \u201cstrong links\u201d between a Crutch dropper from 2016 and a second-stage backdoor \u00a0used by Turla from 2016 to 2017 (called Gazer, also known as WhiteBear).Researchers said that both samples were dropped on the same machine with a five-day interval in September 2017, and they both drop CAB files containing the various malware components. The loaders that were installed by the samples also share clearly related PDB paths, and both decrypt their payloads using the same RC4 key.\u201cGiven these elements and that Turla malware families are not known to be shared among different groups, we believe that Crutch is a malware family that is part of the Turla arsenal,\u201d said researchers.Turla, an infamous cyberespionage group, has been active for more than 10 years. The APT group has targeted many governments worldwide, especially diplomatic entities, and has constantly developed new malware families. This has included an updated version of the ComRAT remote-access trojan (RAT) and a recently updated trio of implants.\u201cCrutch shows that the group is not short of new or currently undocumented backdoors,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThis discovery further strengthens the perception that the Turla group has considerable resources to operate such a large and diverse arsenal.\u201dPut Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows, and other security experts,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

        "raw text": "A macOS backdoor variant has been uncovered that relies of multi-stage payloads and various updated anti-detection techniques. Researchers linked it to the OceanLotus advanced persistent threat (APT) group.The Vietnam-backed OceanLotus (also known as APT 32) has been around since at least 2013, and previously launched targeted attacks against media, research and construction companies. Researchers said that in this case the attackers behind the malware variant appear to be hitting users from Vietnam, because the name of the lure document from the campaign is in Vietnamese. Older samples of the backdoor have targeted the same region before, according to researchers with Trend Micro.\u201cSome of the updates of this new variant include new behavior and domain names,\u201d said researchers Luis Magisa and Steven Du. \u201cThreat groups such as OceanLotus are actively updating malware variants in attempts to evade detection and improve persistence.\u201dThe initial attack vector (such as phishing emails or otherwise) behind the malware is unclear; researchers told Threatpost that because the initial file is a document they assume it came through an email. However, the OceanLotus APT was recently discovered using malicious websites as well as Google Play apps to spread other malware. Researchers also currently have no knowledge of any targets in the campaign, they told Threatpost.The malware is packed in an app, bundled in a .zip archive. The app attempts to pass itself off as a Microsoft Word document (using the Word icon). The app bundle contains two notable files: The shell script containing the main malicious processes, and the \u201cWord\u201d file displayed during execution.In another attempt at evading detection, the app bundle\u2019s name utilizes special characters \u2013 three bytes (\u201cefb880\u201d) that are in UTF-8 encoding.\u201cWhen a user looks for the fake doc folder via the macOS Finder app or the terminal command line, the folder\u2019s name shows \u2018ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.doc\u2019 (\u2018t\u00ecm nh\u00e0 Ch\u1ecb Ng\u1ecdc\u2019 roughly translates to \u2018find Mrs. Ngoc\u2019s house\u2019),\u201d said researchers in a Friday analysis. \u201cHowever, checking the original .zip file that contains the folder shows three unexpected bytes between \u2018.\u2019 and \u2018doc\u2019.\u201dThese bytes are special unicode control characters that don\u2019t change the visual appearance of the file. However, while the file visually looks like a normal file, the operating system sees the app bundle as an unsupported directory type due to these special characters. Therefore, as a default action the \u201copen\u201d command is used to execute the malicious app, said researchers.Once the app is executed, the malware launches a second-stage payload (ALL tim nha Chi Ngoc Canada.?doc/Contents/Resources/configureDefault.def), which in turn drops a third-stage payload before deleting itself.The third-stage payload uses custom encryption, with base64 encoding and byte manipulation. This payload has capabilities for collecting operating system information and submitting the data to its command-and-control (C2) servers; as well as receiving additional C2 communication information.Its backdoor functionalities include the ability to get processor and memory information, get the serial number and get the network interface MAC addresses. All this information is encrypted and sent to the C2 server. Other supported commands include: Getting the file size; downloading and executing files; running commands in terminal; downloading and removing files; and getting config information.Researchers said this malware variant has similarities to another OceanLotus backdoor discovered in 2018, including identical supported commands and their respective codes used in both variants.\u201cThe TTPs and some of its critical function logic are very similar to previous Oceanlotus malware, which led us to believe that it belongs to Oceanlotus,\u201d researchers told Threatpost.OceanLotus has previously been found using other detection evasion tactics, including steganography and injecting malware into the Windows Error Reporting (WER) service to evade detection. From at least January to April, researchers saw the group\u00a0attacking China\u2019s Ministry of Emergency Management, as well as the government of Wuhan province, in an apparent bid to steal intelligence regarding the country\u2019s COVID-19 response. Also in 2020, the group was spotted launching an espionage campaign aimed at Android users in Asia.Researchers said that to avoid malware such as this, macOS users should never click links or download attachments from emails coming from suspicious sources, and regularly patch their software and applications.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a new backdoor written in the Go programming language (Golang), which turned their heads due to its heavy level of obfuscation.The backdoor, called Blackrota, was first discovered in a honeypot owned by researchers, attempting to exploit an unauthorized-access vulnerability in the Docker Remote API. What sets the backdoor apart is its use of extensive anti-detection techniques, which makes the malware extremely difficult to analyze \u2013 something that researchers said is not commonly seen with Golang-based malware.\u201cHistorically, we have seen malware written in Go that was at best stripped at compiling time, and at worst slightly obfuscated, without much difficulty in reverse-analysis,\u201d said researchers with 360 Netlab, in a Tuesday posting. \u201cBlackrota brings a new approach to obfuscation, and is the most obfuscated Go-written malware in ELF format that we have found to date.\u201dResearchers named the malware Blackrota, due to its command-and-control (C2) domain name (blackrota.ga). Threatpost has reached out to 360 Netlab for further information regarding the specific vulnerability being targeted.The MalwareThe Blackrota backdoor is currently only available for Linux, in Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file format, and supports both x86/x86-64 CPU architectures, said researchers. ELF is a common standard file format for executable files. Upon further investigation, researchers found that Blackrota is configured based on what they called a \u201cgeacon.\u201dThis is a type of beacon used by the malware to communicate with a C2 server, asking for instructions or to exfiltrate collected data. This beacon in particular is implemented in the Go language, and has previously been utilized via CobaltStrike, a commodity attack-simulation tool that\u2019s used by attackers to spread malware and control compromised hosts.This beacon implements various key functions for the Blackrota backdoor, allowing it to execute shell commands (CMD_SHELL), upload files (CMD_UPLOAD), download specified files (CMDDOWNLOAD), browse files (CMD_FILE_BROWSE), set a sleep delay time (CMD_SLEEP) and change directories (CMD_CD).ObfuscationWhen it comes to obfuscation, various tactics make Blackrota difficult to analyze and detect. For one, the malware uses gobfuscate, an open-source tool for Go code, to obfuscate the source code before compiling. It hides various elements of Go source code with random character substitutions \u2013 including the package names, global variable names, function names, type names and method names.\u201cWith thousands of random string-named functions and a large number of randomly-named data types, methods and global variables, we could not be sure what third-party Go packages were used inside the sample, making the reverse-analysis almost impossible to move forward,\u201d said researchers.Gobfuscate also replaces all strings used in the code with XOR encodings (the XOR cipher is a cryptographic logic operation that compares two input bits and generates one output bit). In this case, each string is assigned an XOR decoding function that dynamically decodes strings during program execution.\u201cBlackrota uses gobfuscate to obfuscate symbolic and type information, which is the \u2018life-door\u2019 of such reverse-analysis tools,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThe symbolic information they parse and recover becomes unreadable, and it is not possible to make sense of the symbolic and type information, and it is not possible to know which third-party packages were imported to the project. This makes the reverse-analysis process a lot more difficult.\u201dAnother roadblock for analysis is that the Go language uses fully static links to build binary files \u2013 meaning that all of the codes used in standard and third-party libraries are packed into binary files, resulting in very large binary files.\u201cThis characteristic, from a reverse-analysis point of view, means that when you open a Go binary file in a disassembly tool, you will see thousands or even tens of thousands of functions,\u201d said researchers. \u201cIf these functions don\u2019t have corresponding symbolics, it will be difficult to reverse-analyze Go binary files.\u201dResearchers said that obfuscated malware written in Go is rare, but has been seen before. The ransomware strain called EKANS, which is an ransomware variant written in Golang, was previously uncovered using the same obfuscation method as Blackrota, for instance. Researchers warned that these new types of malware will create a headache for security defenders moving forward when it comes to analysis and detection.\u201cThe obfuscation method of Blackrota and EKANS creates new challenges for reverse analysis,\u201d said researchers. \u201cAs the Go language becomes more popular, more and more malware will be written in Go in the future\u2026we will keep an eye on what is going to happen.\u201dMalware",

        "raw text": "ModPipe, a previously unknown backdoor, has been purpose-built to attack restaurant point-of-sale (PoS) solutions from Oracle. It\u2019s notable for its unusual sophistication, according to researchers, evidenced by its multiple modules.The code is specifically taking aim at the Oracle MICROS Restaurant Enterprise Series (RES) 3700 POS \u2013 a management software suite used by hundreds of thousands of bars, restaurants, hotels and other hospitality establishments worldwide, according to ESET. The attacks have mainly been in the U.S., researchers said \u2013 though the initial infection vector is unknown.One of the malware\u2019s downloadable modules, called GetMicInfo, is particularly distinctive, the firm noted. It sniffs out and exfiltrates credentials that allow ModPipe\u2019s operators to access database contents, including various definitions and configuration data, status tables and information about PoS transactions.\u201c[It] contains an algorithm designed to gather database passwords by decrypting them from Windows registry values,\u201d researchers explained in a Thursday blog post. \u201cThis shows that the backdoor\u2019s authors have deep knowledge of the targeted software and opted for this sophisticated method instead of collecting the data via a simpler yet \u2018louder\u2019 approach, such as keylogging.\u201dThat said, the database info that the module lifts wouldn\u2019t include the plum data prize: Credit-card numbers and expirations.\u201cThe only customer data stored in the clear and thus available to the attackers should be cardholder names,\u201d ESET noted. \u201cThis would limit the amount of valuable information viable for further sale or misuse, making the full business model behind the operation unclear. One possible explanation is that another downloadable module exists that allows the malware operators to decrypt the more sensitive data in the user\u2019s database.\u201dModPipe is multi-stage, starting with an initial dropper. The dropper in turn installs a persistent loader on the compromised machine. This in turn unpacks and loads in the main module.The main module creates a pipe used for communication with other malicious modules (hence the malware\u2019s name). It\u2019s responsible for implementing these, and also handles the connection to the attackers\u2019 command-and-control (C2) server. Meanwhile, a networking module performs the actual communication with the C2.\u201cResponses from the C2 server have to be at least 33-bytes long in order to be parsed by the networking module and the malicious payload is located after a sequence of 13 spaces followed by an HTML comment opening tag,\u201d according to ESET.Then there\u2019s a range of other downloadable modules for adding specific functionality to the backdoor. In addition to the aforementioned info-stealer, two that are known can scan specific IP addresses or acquire a list of the running processes on the target.\u201cIn April 2020, after a couple of months of hunting, we found three of these modules in the wild,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cOur research also suggests that the operators use at least four other downloadable modules, whose functionality remains completely unknown to us for now.\u201dModPipe shows quite a few interesting features,\u201d researchers said. \u201cModPipe\u2019s architecture, modules and their capabilities also indicate that its writers have extensive knowledge of the targeted RES 3700 POS software. The proficiency of the operators could stem from multiple scenarios, including stealing and reverse-engineering the proprietary software product, misusing its leaked parts or buying code from an underground market.\u201dHackers Put Bullseye on Healthcare:\u00a0On Nov. 18 at 2 p.m. EDT\u00a0find out why hospitals are getting hammered by ransomware attacks in 2020.\u00a0Save your spot for this FREE webinar\u00a0on healthcare cybersecurity priorities and hear from leading security voices on how data security, ransomware and patching need to be a priority for every sector, and why.

        "raw text": "A fresh Linux backdoor called Doki is infesting Docker servers in the cloud, researchers warn, employing a brand-new technique: Using a blockchain wallet for generating command-and-control (C2) domain names.Doki however is meant to provide a persistent capability for code-execution on an infected host, setting the scene for any number of malware-based attacks, from denial-of-service/sabotage to information exfiltration to ransomware, according to Intezer.The campaign starts with an increasingly common attack vector: The compromise of misconfigured Docker API ports. Attackers scan for publicly accessible, open Docker servers in an automated fashion, and then exploit them in order to set up their own containers and execute malware on the victim\u2019s infrastructure. Usually that malware is a cryptominer of some kind, as seen in April in a Bitcoin-mining campaign using the Kinsing malware \u2014 but Doki represents an evolution in payload.The Doki attackers are using an existing Ngrok-based botnet to spread the backdoor, via a network scanner that targets hardcoded ranges of IP addresses for cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and local cloud providers in Austria, China and the United Kingdom. Ngrok is a legitimate reverse proxy service that cybercriminals have been using for C2 communications with infected bot endpoints. The scanner looks for potentially vulnerable targets, gathers relevant information and uploads it to a Ngrok URL controlled by the attackers. The attackers then compromise the new targets.\u201cOur evidence shows that it takes only a few hours from when a new misconfigured Docker server is up online to become infected by this campaign,\u201d according to researchers at Intezer, writing in an analysis this week. \u201cThe attackers are spawning and deleting a number of containers during this attack.\u201dThe Infection RoutineAfter identifying a vulnerable server and gaining entry to a server via the open API, the attackers are setting up publicly available, curl-based images within the Docker Hub. These images aren\u2019t malicious themselves, but they can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as setting up a container and then escaping from it to gain broader access to the host. Intezer researchers noted that attackers could also compromise an existing image and \u201crun their own logic and malware on top of it.\u201dFollowing from this, the next step in the attack is to create a container using a \u201ccreate\u201d API request.\u201cThe body of the request contains configuration parameters for the container,\u201d according to researchers. \u201cOne of the parameters is \u2018bind,\u2019 which lets the user configure which file or directory on the host machine to mount into a container.\u201dIn this case, the container is configured to bind the /tmpXXXXXX directory to the root directory of the hosting server. This allows a container escape \u2013 i.e., the ability to break free of the boundaries of the attacker-created container in order to interact with other containers, and view and modify configurations. \u00a0Essentially this means that every file on the server\u2019s filesystem can be accessed and modified, with the correct user permissions, from within the attacker-created container.\u201cThis attack is very dangerous due to the fact the attacker uses container escape techniques to gain full control of the victim\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d according to Intezer.After that, \u201cthe attacker abuses Ngrok to craft unique URLs with a short lifetime and uses them to download payloads during the attack by passing them to the curl-based image,\u201d the analysis explained. \u201cThe downloaded payload is saved in /tmpXXXXXX directory in the container.\u201dOne of the first of these payloads is a downloader script, responsible for downloading and installing various second-stage malware binaries. Intezer recently noticed the new Doki payload being fetched as one of the second-stage samples.The Doki PayloadDoki is a backdoor for Linux which executes any code received from its operators. It sports a unique feature: A previously undocumented method to find and contact its C2 domain dynamically in real time, by abusing the Dogecoin cryptocurrency blockchain.It spins off a separate process to establish its own C2 communications, apart from that of the botnet. As Intezer explained, in order to generate a C2 domain using its unique domain-generation algorithm (DGA), it queries dogechain.info API, a Dogecoin cryptocurrency block explorer, to retrieve an amount that was spent from a hardcoded wallet address controlled by the attacker. That value is sent back and then hashed with SHA256; the malware then saves the first 12 characters from the hex-string representation of the SHA256 value, to be used as the subdomain.It can then construct a full address by appending the subdomain to ddns.net, which is a domain offered by the legitimate DynDNS service.\u201cUsing this technique the attacker controls which address the malware will contact by transferring a specific amount of Dogecoin from his or her wallet,\u201d explained the Intezer researchers. \u201cSince only the attacker has control over the wallet, only he can control when and how much Dogecoin to transfer, and thus switch the domain accordingly. Additionally, since the blockchain is both immutable and decentralized, this novel method can prove to be quite resilient to both infrastructure takedowns from law enforcement and domain filtering attempts from security products.\u201dThe researchers said that Doki has until now been \u201ca fully undetected malware component.\u201d To wit, they noted that as recently as this week, Doki had failed to be detected by any of the 60 malware detection engines in VirusTotal, despite having been uploaded to the repository on January 14. At this time of writing, 24 of the 60 engines are detecting the malware.The Ngrok botnet is an urgent threat that is actively improving itself over time, Intezer warned, and adding new payloads beyond its typical cryptomining fare.\u201cThe Ngrok botnet campaign has been ongoing for over two years and is rather effective, infecting any misconfigured Docker API server in a matter of hours,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe incorporation of the unique and undetected Doki malware indicates the operation is continuing to evolve.\u201dThreatpost has reached out to Intezer for any information regarding how widespread the Doki backdoor has become.To avoid infection, Docker admins should check for any exposed ports, verify there are no foreign or unknown containers among the existing containers,and monitor excessive use of resources.Complimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?

        "raw text": "A series of cyberattacks on a telecom company in the Middle East has signaled the return of the OilRig APT. The attacks also revealed a revised backdoor tool in the group\u2019s arsenal, called RDAT.The attacks were observed in April by Palo Alto Networks\u2019 Unit 42. Researchers there said that the version of RDAT in question was uncovered during the course of its investigation, standing out by using a unique command-and-control (C2) channel. To wit, it uses steganography to hide commands and data within bitmap images attached to emails.The backdoor first debuted as a proprietary OilRig weapon in 2017 and has gone through several updates since then, the firm noted, adding that timestamps indicate that OilRig added the steganography trick to RDAT\u2019s profile as far back as 2018.\u201cIn June 2018, the developer of RDAT added the ability to use Exchange Web Services (EWS) to send and receive emails for C2 communications,\u201d according to Unit 42\u2019s report, issued Wednesday. \u201cThis email-based C2 channel is novel in its design, as it relies on steganography to hide commands and exfiltrates data within BMP images attached to the emails. The combination of using emails with steganographic images to carry the data across the C2 can result in this activity being much more difficult to detect and allow for higher chances of defense evasion.\u201dAlong with RDAT, OilRig in the telecom campaign used custom Mimikatz tools for collecting credentials, Bitvise to create SSH tunnels and PowerShell downloaders to perform post-exploitation activities.\u201cTwo of the related tools collected had PDB paths similar to ones we had seen in the past. The PDB paths were C:\\Users\\Void\\Desktop\\dns\\client\\x64\\Release\\client.pdb and C:\\Users\\Void\\Desktop\\RDAT\\client\\x64\\Release\\client.pdb,\u201d according to Unit 42. \u201cUsing the file path of the user in the PDB string of C:\\Users\\Void\\Desktop as shown in Figure 1, we gathered over a dozen samples with that file path, with most of the samples identified as a known OilRig tool called ISMDOOR. Considering the small cluster of related tools, it is highly likely these have been developed by a single adversary or adversary group with control over the codebase.\u201dIn May, Symantec published research on the Greenbug group targeting telecommunications organizations in Southeast Asia. Unit 42 has previously linked Greenbug to OilRig, a threat group that first emerged in 2015.The Novel C2 ChannelRDAT communicates with two hardcoded actor-controlled email addresses: koko@acrlee[.]com and h76y@acrlee[.]com. It simply sends email to the actor-controlled email addresses, attaching Bitmap images that contain hidden messages or data to exfiltrate.\u201cTo send emails from the compromised host, the payload uses the email associated with the account logged into the compromised host, as it uses the WinHTTP library to make requests to the API [with the security level in the auto-login policy field set to low], which automatically attempts to log onto Exchange using the default credentials,\u201d according to the report.OilRig meanwhile communicates with RDAT in turn by sending emails to the compromised account. RDAT creates an inbox rule to move any incoming C2 messages t the junk folder, then continually looks there for commands, which are hidden within Bitmap images.\u201cThe payload will issue a request to the EWS API to check for unread emails from the actor\u2019s email addresses with an attachment,\u201d researchers said. \u201cIf the payload obtains an email sent by the actor, the payload will process the response to the SOAP request and send additional requests to the EWS API to get the email, the attachment and the contents of the attachment\u2026It then saves this content to a file in the %TEMP% folder with a \u2018.bmp\u2019 file extension. It then issues a SOAP request to delete the processed email.\u201dThe email C2 channel supplements the HTTP and DNS-tunneling C2 channels seen in other RDAT samples, researchers said. But regardless of the C2 channel used, the RDAT sample parses responses using a command handler to determine the course of action to take. These include the ability to execute commands, upload and download to and from the C2, take screenshots, restart its processes and delete itself.\u201cThe majority of samples used some combination of HTTP and DNS tunneling channels, with the single exception where we discovered the developer leveraging Exchange Web Services to send and receive emails to and from the actor using steganographic image file attachments,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cThe use of a novel C2 channel in combination with steganography shows the continued evolution and development of different tactics and techniques by this adversary over time.\u201dOilRig Continues Its ActivityBelieved to be a state-sponsored group\u00a0under the auspices of to the Iranian intelligence agency and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), OilRig\u2019s primary purpose appears to be espionage efforts targeted at financial, aviation, infrastructure, government and university organizations in the MidEast region.It\u2019s known for continually evolving its tools. The group, which is also called Cobalt Gypsy, Crambus, Helix Kitten or APT34, for instance was seen in February establishing a highly developed and persistent infrastructure that could be converted to distribute destructive wiper malware. That malware, known as ZeroCleare, was spotted in December.Malware",

        "raw text": "The Russia-linked APT group Sandworm has been spotted exploiting a vulnerability in the internet\u2019s top email server software, according to the National Security Agency (NSA).The bug exists in the Exim Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) software, an open-source offering used on Linux and Unix-like systems. It essentially receives, routes and delivers email messages from local users and remote hosts. Exim is the default MTA included on some Linux distros like Debian and Red Hat, and Exim-based mail servers in general run almost 57 percent of the internet\u2019s email servers, according to a survey last year.The bug (CVE-2019-10149) would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands with root privileges on an Exim mail server, allowing the attacker to install programs, modify data and create new accounts. It\u2019s also wormable; a previous campaign spread cryptominers automatically from system to system using a port sniffer. The bug was patched last June.The NSA this week released a cybersecurity advisory on new exploit activity from Unit 74455 of the GRU Main Center for Special Technologies (GTsST), a division of the Russian military intelligence service, a.k.a. Sandworm, a.k.a. BlackEnergy. The APT has been linked to the Industroyer attack on the Ukrainian power grid as well as the infamous NotPetya attacks. According to Kaspersky, the group is part of a nexus of related APTs that also includes a recently discovered group called Zebrocy.The flaw can be exploited using a specially crafted email containing a modified \u201cMAIL FROM\u201d field in a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) message. The APT has been exploiting unpatched Exim servers in this way since at least August, according the NSA\u2019s advisory.Once Sandworm compromises a target Exim server, it subsequently downloads and executes a shell script from a Sandworm-controlled domain to establish a persistent backdoor that can be used for reconnaissance, spying on mail messages, lateral movement and additional malware implantation.\u201cThis script would attempt to do the following on the victim machine: Add privileged users; disable network security settings; update SSH configurations to enable additional remote access; and execute an additional script to enable follow-on exploitation,\u201d according to the NSA, which didn\u2019t disclose any details as to the victimology of the latest offensives.Exim admins should update their MTAs to version 4.93 or newer to mitigate the issue, the NSA noted.\u201cThis emphasizes the need for a good vulnerability management plan,\u201d Lamar Bailey, senior director of security research at Tripwire, said via email. \u201cCVE-2019-10149 has been out almost a year now and has a CVSS score above 9, making it a critical vulnerability. High-scoring vulnerabilities on a production email server are high risk and there should be plans in place to remediate them ASAP.\u201dConcerned about the IoT security challenges businesses face as more connected devices run our enterprises, drive our manufacturing lines, track and deliver healthcare to patients, and more?

        "raw text": "The financial services sector in the U.S. found itself under a barrage of cyberattacks last month, all bent on delivering a powerful backdoor called Minebridge. The attack chain employed a known method called \u201cVBA Stomping\u201d to avoid detection.According to researchers at FireEye, the campaigns, aimed at enabling further malware infections and espionage efforts, were initiated via phishing emails with attached documents containing malicious macros. The emails were coming from fake domains that were geared to add legitimacy to the messages, resulting in a convincing theme running throughout the proceedings.For instance, the first campaign, initially spotted on Jan. 7, carried a tax theme (subject line: \u201cTax Return File,\u201d with IRS-related text in the message). This was reinforced through the use of a CPA-themed domain used in the email addresses: rogerveCPS [dot]com. The attached document meanwhile mimicked an H&R Block-related tax form.Another campaign, which started on Jan. 28, had a recruiting theme, with messages sent from various emails that all used the domain name agent4career[dot]com. The subject line and message body in this case referenced an \u201cemployment candidate with experience in the financial sector,\u201d according to the FireEye research, released on Wednesday \u2013 and the attached document purported to be the person\u2019s resume.\u201cOne of the more notable characteristics of this activity was the consistency in themes used for domain registration, lure content, similarities in malicious document macro content and targeting,\u201d according to the research.VBA Stomping to Hide Malicious MacrosAcross campaigns, the attached phishing documents used the \u201cVBA Stomping\u201d tactic to hide their malicious macros. The term refers to \u201cthe manipulation of Office documents where the source code of a macro is made to mismatch the pseudo-code (p-code) of the document,\u201d according to FireEye.P-code is the natural language translation of programming code \u2013 essentially, it describes in readable terms what the code is programmed to do.This mismatching technique has a few benefits when it comes to evading detection. \u201cStatic analysis tools focusing on VBA macro source extraction may be fooled into a benign assessment of a document bearing malicious p-code,\u201d according to FireEye\u2019s analysis. And, \u201cwhen VBA source is removed, and a document is opened in a version of Office for which the p-code was not compiled to execute, a macro will not execute correctly, resulting in potential failed dynamic analysis.\u201dHowever, some sophistication is required in order to use the tactic effectively, according to the firm: \u201cAn actor\u2019s VBA stomped document containing benign VBA source but evil p-code must know the version of Office to build the p-code for, or their sample will not detonate properly. Additionally, if an actor sends a stomped document, and a user or researcher opens the macro in the Office editor, they will see malicious code.\u201dIn this case, the attackers got around those restrictions by making viewing the macro source impossible within Office. They did this by modifying the PROJECT stream of the document. Within the stream, a module is referenced but not defined \u2013 a method that requires a knowledge of the target\u2019s machine and which is suitable for higher-end, more targeted activity.\u201c[Now the] payloads have the additional burden of needing to fingerprint targets to enable successful execution,\u201d according to FireEye\u2019s report. \u201cWhile actors with sufficient resources and creativity can no doubt account for these requirements, it is relevant to note that detections for these methodologies will likely yield more targeted activity.\u201dThe Minebridge PayloadThe ultimate goal of the document is to infect victims with the Minebridge backdoor. It\u2019s a powerful piece of malware that gives attackers full control of the target environment. Its C2 commands include downloading and executing other malware, downloading arbitrary files, self-deletion and updating, process listing, shutting down and rebooting the system, executing arbitrary shell commands, process elevation, turning on/off TeamViewer\u2019s microphone and gathering system information.If the document is \u201cdetonated\u201d and the malicious macros are executed, the code fetches a ZIP file containing legitimate files required to execute an older copy of Microsoft TeamViewer, which is then renamed to \u201cwpvnetwks.exe.\u201d This malicious TeamViewer instance then side-loads a DLL containing the Minebridge backdoor.\u201cMinebridge is a 32-bit C++ backdoor designed to be loaded by an older, unpatched instance of the legitimate remote desktop software TeamViewer by DLL load-order hijacking,\u201d according to FireEye\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe backdoor hooks Windows APIs to prevent the victim from seeing the TeamViewer application.\u201dMinebridge makes a connection to a hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server via HTTPS POST requests and by sending TeamViewer chat messages using a custom window procedure hook.It also establishes persistence by creating a link file at %CISDL_STARTUP%\\Windows WMI.lnk, which points to %AppData%\\Windows Media Player\\wpnetwks.exe, resulting in its launch at user logon.Attribution ThoughtsInterestingly, Minebridge uses a packer called Minedoor that FireEye has previously seen used by another threat actor, indicating a potential connection \u2013 though this is far from a confident assessment.\u201cWe\u2019ve observed a group publicly tracked as TA505 conducting [recent] phishing campaigns that use Minedoor to deliver the FriendSpeak backdoor,\u201d according to the firm.However, none of the other aspects of the campaigns match up. The FriendSpeak efforts \u201cuse spoofed sender addresses, Excel spreadsheets with embedded payloads and campaign-specific domains that masquerade as common technology services,\u201d researchers said. The campaigns delivering Minebridge also appear to be significantly smaller in both volume and scope.Also, the campaigns delivering Minebridge continued even over Eastern Orthodox Christmas when Russian-speaking actors are commonly inactive; this was not the case for the FriendSpeak campaigns.\u201c[This] may suggest TA505 actors speak Russian\u201d while the Minebridge actors do not, FireEye researchers concluded. Nonetheless, the firm hasn\u2019t ruled out the possibility that the Minebridge attackers are a subset of TA505, it said.Learn how Operational Technology and Information Technology systems are merging and changing security playbooks in this free Threatpost Webinar.

It\u2019s deployed as a module after the initial TrickBot infection has already taken hold on a victim computer.\u201cThe end-goal of the PowerTrick backdoor and its approach is to bypass restrictions and security controls to adapt to the new age of security controls and exploit the most protected and secure air-gapped high-value networks,\u201d according to the analysis.\nThe firm\u2019s researchers observed a smaller initial backdoor script being first deployed, sometimes in the form of a PowerShell task, which establishes contact with the command-and-control (C2) server. After that, the malware operators send the first command, which is to download the main PowerTrick backdoor.Once installed, PowerTrick carries out the usual backdoor functions, according to the analysis: It performs an initial check-in and then sits in a loop request waiting for the next commands to be received. It executes these and sends back results or errors; and it can sleep for certain amounts of time on demand.The TrickBot operators use their access to carry out other tasks, mainly by leveraging PowerShell utilities. For instance, SentinelLabs observed PowerTrick downloading \u201cletmein,\u201d a PowerShell-based script for connecting to open-source exploitation framework Metasploit, to perform reconnaissance and identify other machines to which to expand the TrickBot infestation laterally.\u201cOnce the system and network have been profiled, the actors either stealthily clean up and move on to a different target of choice, or perform lateral movement inside the environment to high-value systems such as financial gateways,\u201d the researchers noted.In addition to Metasploit, the backdoor also calls other pieces of code, which function as backdoors as well. These include TrickBot\u2019s custom Anchor Project DNS variant; and the More_eggs JScript backdoor malware (a.k.a. Terra Loader or SpicyOmelette), which is sold on the Dark Web as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering. Also, the cybercriminals have been seen using direct shellcode execution via PowerTrick as an additional methodology for payload deployment.Using the backdoor as a gateway to yet more backdoors is an effort to stay stealthy, according to SentinelLabs.\u201cThis is something we have observed frequently where the actors will modify or create new delivery systems frequently in order to bypass restrictions and security controls,\u201d the researchers said.TrickBot was developed in 2016 as a banking malware to succeed the Dyre banking trojan; but since then, it has developed into an all-purpose, module-based crimeware solution targeted specifically to corporations. If past is prologue, the addition of PowerTrick to its arsenal is par for the course in terms of the malware\u2019s ongoing and rapid development. Most recently, it has added the ability to harvest desktop application credentials\u00a0and perform\u00a0stealthy code injection; and, its operators have been seen collaborating with North Korea-linked APT Lazarus.\u201cTrickBot has shifted focus to enterprise environments over the years to incorporate many techniques from network profiling, mass data collection, incorporation of lateral traversal exploits,\u201d according to the SentinelLab analysis. \u201cThis focus shift is also prevalent in their incorporation of malware and techniques in their tertiary deliveries that are targeting enterprise environments, it is similar to a company where the focus will shift depending on what generates the best revenue.\u201dConcerned about mobile security?\u00a0Check out our free Threatpost webinar,\u00a0Top 8 Best Practices for Mobile App Security, on Jan. 22 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Poorly secured apps can lead to malware, data breaches and legal/regulatory trouble.

        "raw text": "A new threat actor has been found\u00a0 impersonating the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and other government agencies to deliver and install backdoor malware to various organizations in Germany, Italy and the United States, according to new research.The campaigns, which researchers from cybersecurity firm Proofpoint observed between Oct. 16 and Nov. 12, are consistent with emerging tactics from bad actors to use increasingly sophisticated social engineering and spoofing to deliver malware, researchers said.\u00a0The threat actor sent malicious email messages \u201ctargeting no particular vertical but with recipients that were heavily weighted towards business and IT services, manufacturing and healthcare,\u201d according to a blog\u00a0Thursday unveiling the research, posted by the Proofpoint Threat Insight Team.The actors used different tools to deliver each of the country-specific campaigns, impersonating organizations that would be familiar to users in those countries to try to get victims to take the bait.\u00a0Various lures included emails informing recipients of the urgent need to open documents to avoid tax penalties, or to view tax refunds with a deadline for processing, among others, researchers noted.The first email campaigns turned up in Germany, where the actors impersonated the Bundeszentralamt fur Steuern (the German Federal Ministry of Finance), using \u00a0\u201clookalike domains, verbiage and stolen branding in the emails,\u201d according to the post.Another campaign impersonated a German internet service provider to try to lure German organizations to click on malicious attachments.\u00a0For its German campaigns, the actor used commercial software, Cobalt Strike, in its attacks. The tool is generally used for penetration testing and emulates the type of backdoor framework used by Metasploit, a similar penetration testing tool, researchers said.\u00a0Although this software is legitimately used, this is not the first time bad actors have used it for malicious purposes. Other threat actors, including Cobalt Group, APT32 and APT19, also have deployed and executed campaigns using it as malware.\u00a0Attacks in Italy and the United States showed the threat actor using slightly different types of malware but still employing the impersonation tactic.In its most recent campaign, observed on Tuesday, Nov. 12, the actor targeted organizations in the United States by attempting to deliver malicious Microsoft Word attachments to victims that deployed the IcedID banking trojan.This campaign was noticeably different than previous European campaigns in that the actor chose a .com lookalike (uspsdelivery-service.com) instead of an .icu domain, which the other campaigns used.\u00a0However, the campaign did show a hallmark of previous emails in that it delivered a malicious Microsoft Word attachment with a purported RSA SecurID key, similarly formatted to the one used in the European campaigns, researchers said.Researchers also observed the actor distributing Maze ransomware, employing similar social-engineering techniques that it uses for Cobalt Strike, while targeting organizations in Italy by impersonating the Agenzia Delle Entrate, the Italian Revenue Agency. \u00a0 Overall, the newly observed activity is evidence of a growing trend that Proofpoint and other security teams already have seen, in which email-based attacks are becoming more socially savvy, researchers said.\u201cThe increasing sophistication of these lures mirrors improved social engineering and a focus on effectiveness over quantity appearing in many campaigns globally across the email threat landscape,\u201d Proofpoint researchers wrote.\u00a0MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "APT threat group Platinum has a shiny new plaything: A custom trojan backdoor dubbed Titanium.The backdoor\u2019s name, aside from keeping with the silvery metal theme, comes from password to one of the self-executable archives found in the code. According to Kaspersky researchers who analyzed the malware, it can, among other things, read any file from a file system and exfiltrate the data; drop or delete a file in the file system; drop a file and run it; run a command line and upload the execution results; and update configuration parameters (except the AES encryption key). It also features an interactive mode which allows to the attacker to receive input from console programs.Titanium was spotted as the final payload in a campaign that also included dropper placement, additional downloading and installing stages in its infection vector, the researchers said. Interestingly, the malware hides along the way during each of these steps by mimicking file names for common software, including security packages, sound drivers and DVD video-creation tools.Platinum is one of the most technologically advanced APT actors out there, with a traditional focus on the APAC region, the researchers said, and this campaign bore that out: Victims were located in South and Southeast Asia.A Multi-Stage AffairThe complex sequence of stages in all of the observed attacks so far starts with an exploit capable of gaining code-execution as a SYSTEM user, after which the adversaries install a shellcode to connect to a hardcoded command-and-control (C2) address to download the next downloader, researchers said.According to the analysis, released on Friday, that second downloader in turn fetches an SFX (self-extracting) archive that contains a Windows task installation script, in the form of cURL executable code, compiled into a DLL. Its purpose is to install a Windows task to establish persistence in the infected system.The downloader also fetches a password-protected SFX archive (password: Titanium) that must be launched from the command line; an installer script; and a BITS downloader, used to download encrypted files from the C2 server then decrypt and launch them.And finally, it downloads the Titanium backdoor itself.The whole, multi-stage code is obfuscated with different Windows API calls and loops in an attempt to bypass antivirus emulation engines, Kaspersky noted.Once Titanium was installed in the observed campaign, Kaspersky researchers said that it appeared that the group compromised local intranet websites with a malicious code to start spreading; or, it injected a shellcode into the \u201cwinlogon.exe\u201d process.Digging into TitaniumTo initialize the connection to the C2, Titanium sends a base64-encoded request that contains the unique SystemID, computer name and hard disk serial number of the infected machine. After that, the malware is ready to swing into action.\u201cTo receive commands, the backdoor sends an empty request to the C2,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cIt uses the UserAgent string from the configuration stage and a special cookie generation algorithm to prepare a request. The malware can also get proxy settings from Internet Explorer.\u201dIn response to this request, the C2 answers back with a .PNG image file that contains steganographically hidden data, encrypted with the same key as the C2 requests. The decrypted data contains the backdoor commands, ordering it to carry out its many functions.\u201cThe Titanium [campaign] has a very complicated infiltration scheme,\u201d Kaspersky researchers said. \u201cIt involves numerous steps and requires good coordination between all of them. In addition, none of the files in the file system can be detected as malicious, due to the use of encryption and fileless technologies. One other feature that makes detection harder is the mimicking of well-known software.\u201dWhat are the top risks to modern enterprises in the peak era of data breaches?

        "raw text": "Despite a high-profile memory-related vulnerability in password managers capturing headlines last week, a recent Threatpost poll found that 84 percent of respondents use password managers \u2013 while only 10 percent said they don\u2019t due to security risks.There have been vulnerabilities found before in this kind of software, and malware\u00a0has also been found targeting it. The latest issue allows a local adversary to crack open and steal passwords stored by the\u00a01Password, Dashlane, KeePass\u00a0and LastPass utilities; the firms have fiercely hit back on the assessment that this poses a serious risk.Threatpost asked readers to weigh in on whether they embrace password managers or think they pose too much of a risk: And more than 700 respondents decided to weigh in on the poll.A full 84 percent said that they do indeed use password managers, while only 10 percent felt that they\u2019re too risky. However, individual comments showed that some don\u2019t password-manager users still fully trust them.\u201cI use one for non-important password storage, important ones are in my mind,\u201d said one respondent.\u201cThey\u2019re risky, but convenient,\u201d said another.Others weighed in on other concerns around these utilities. One respondent in the anti-password manager camp commented that they inspire a false sense of security; and another noted that \u201clocal banking contracts do not allow for their use.\u201dHumans: The Main Risk?As far as the biggest risk to password-manager security, vulnerabilities (48 percent) and keylogging (38 percent) took the top places. Other individual answers included \u201cman-in-the-browser malware,\u201d \u201cside-channel attacks\u201d and \u201ccloud-exposed vulnerabilities.\u201dBut many respondents blamed a lack of user awareness, saying the greatest risk is:\u00a0\u201cLaziness, weak master password; non-use of 2FA,\u201d \u201cend users,\u201d \u201chumans\u201d, \u201cthe person behind the keyboard\u201d and \u201cusers not using a strong enough master password, or leaving the app \u2018always on.'\u201d And one respondent, unconcerned about putting too fine a point on it, simply said, \u201cdumb people.\u201dElaborating on this theme that the weakest point in password-manager security is the users, Threatpost reader \u201cBrekmister,\u201d commented: \u201cHackers will always find a way around and users will fall for it because they won\u2019t know any better. If there are vulnerabilities in a piece of software and the user knows what they are doing then, ppfffttt yeah, whatever. Well, even then we are still human beings\u2026 The No. 1 key point to what I think can stop attacks is education for the users. Which frankly is too hard, so we just keep patching things.\u201d2FA: Making Managers Safer?When it comes to how password managers could be safer, individual suggestions included eliminating web-based password managers, and better design so that passwords are securely stored in separate sandboxes. Auto-clearing memory and additional obfuscation of username/email addresses used for accounts were also mentioned. However, half (52 percent) said that users need to adopt two-factor authentication (2FA), making this the clear favorite for reducing risk.However, \u201cyou cannot make password managers safer using 2FA,\u201d said Threatpost reader Paul Moore. \u201cIf your password manager uses authentication over encryption, you have bigger issues. Several companies advertise 2FA support, but it\u2019s not technically possible. It\u2019s security theatre by the marketing department.\u201dAnother reader named Rich argued that this is \u201cnot entirely true.\u201dHe explained, \u201cFor password managers that store their vaults in the cloud, 2FA prevents phishing attacks from getting your vault, even if they get your master password. Otherwise I agree. If malware can keylog your master password, it can get the local cache of your vault.\u201dAnother Threatpost reader, Diogene, noted that \u201cencryption is much more important. The best solution is using a very long encryption key stored on a removable device that you keep physically separate from password manager data file most of the time.\u201dThe Spreadsheet EffectWhen asked about their overall attitude towards password managers, about half (56 percent) said they\u2019re safer than storing passwords in a spreadsheet or reusing the same one for multiple accounts. One reader made the assessment that they\u2019re \u201crisky, better than spreadsheets and safety is only as good as security awareness.\u201dHowever, the idea of keeping a spreadsheet with passwords provoked an array of responses. One poll-taker said that he or she has eschewed a manager for \u201ca list of passwords in an encrypted document.\u201dSimilarly, \u201cI don\u2019t use a password manager,\u201d one commentator said. \u201cI do use a password-protected excel spreadsheet to hold my passwords. That way they are in my hands and not some third party. I also keep a hard-coded printout in a safe place.\u201dDon\u2019t miss our free\u00a0Threatpost webinar\u00a0this Wednesday, Feb. 27 at 2 p.m. ET, featuring\u00a0Patrick Hevesi of Gartner;\u00a0Mike Burr of Google Android; and David Richardson from Lookout.\u00a0One reader listing himself as \u201cMark\u201d argued with that line of thinking. \u201cBut what you\u2019ve described is just how password managers work \u2013 they don\u2019t share the passwords with third parties,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even if you don\u2019t trust LastPass, with managers like KeePass, there is no third party. And the recent security risks exposed likely affect your hand-made method too: When you view your decrypted passwords in excel, can you view one at a time? Are the passwords scrubbed from memory after you\u2019ve viewed them? If not, you\u2019re vulnerable in the same way.\u201dThe Memory FlawThe latest issue with password managers (1Password, Dashlane, KeePass and LastPass) at the time of testing by ISE was that each of the utilities stored either the master password or individual credentials on insecure memory on the PC. This could allow a local adversary or a remote attacker, who compromised the system, to obtain passwords maintained by the utilities.The one exception, researchers note, is when the password managers are not in use.\u201cAll password managers we examined sufficiently secured user secrets while in a \u2018not running\u2019 state. That is, if a password database were to be extracted from disk and if a strong master password was used, then brute forcing of a password manager would be computationally prohibitive,\u201d ISE\u2019s team explained.When asked if it\u2019s concerning that a local attacker could harvest passwords using the latest vulnerability, about half (47 percent) of the Threatpost poll respondents agreed that it is, but \u201cnot enough for me to ditch password managers.\u201d\u201cit\u2019s scary, but I am still open to adapting a password manager,\u201d one said. \u201cThis is why I set short lockouts and auth when needed,\u201d said another.In fact, just 6 percent said that the vulnerability is concerning and wards them off password managers.\u201cI switched password managers because of it,\u201d said one. Another respondent added, \u201cI\u2019ll have to monitor how my password manager handles their weaknesses and adjust.\u201dAbout a third (29 percent) agreed that \u201cthey may have weaknesses, but the likelihood of a successful attack is low, so I\u2019m not worried.\u201dAnother almost half (45 percent) felt that the concern here is actually overblown given that a local attacker would need to gain access to the victim\u2019s computer first.Many of the comments noted that if one\u2019s computer is already compromised, then the vulnerability become moot or at the very least, redundant.\u201cA local adversary can just install [a] keylogger,\u201d as one pointed out. \u201cAny password is vulnerable if the computer is compromised,\u201d another respondent noted. Other assessments included, \u201cIf your device is compromised, so are you. No software can protect you.\u201d And, \u201can attacker with access to my computer can harvest my passwords anyways.\u201dEven so, as one Threatpost reader commented, the vulnerability should be fixed.\u201cAll password management software has to review how they store master passwords and the passwords database,\u201d the reader said. \u201cIn all cases, the master password should not be held in memory if not needed. At the same time, the passwords database should not be loaded fully into memory (like some password-management software does). Only single entry (which is used at the moment) should be in memory, and once used, should be removed, so nothing can be scraped from memory.\u201dInterested in learning more about mobile enterprise security threats and best practices?

        "raw text": "A newly discovered and complex remote access trojan (RAT) is spreading via malicious email campaigns using COVID-19 lures and includes numerous features to evade analysis or detection by researchers, Proofpoint has found.Dubbed Nerbian RAT, the novel malware variant is written in the OS-agnostic Go programming language and \u201cutilizes significant anti-analysis and anti-reversing capabilities\u201d, according to a Proofpoint blog post published Wednesday.The name appointed by Proofpoint researchers is based on a named function in the malware code and appears to be derived from \u201cNerbia,\u201d a fictional place from the novel\u00a0Don Quixote, researchers said.Proofpoint researchers first observed the RAT being distributed in a low-volume email campaign beginning on April 26 in messages sent to multiple industries, mainly impacting organizations in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, they said.\u201cThe emails claimed to be representing the World Health Organization (WHO) with important information regarding COVID-19,\u201d researchers wrote, noting that the messages are a throwback to similar phishing campaigns that circulated in 2020 in the early days of the pandemic.Sample emails shared in the post are sent from email addresses attempting to appear as if they coming from the WHO, such as who.inter.svc@gmail[.]com and announce@who-international[.]com, and use as their subject line WHO or World Health Organization.The messages include safety measures related to COVID-19 as well as attachments that also include \u201ccovid19\u201d in their names but are actually Word documents containing malicious macros.When macros are enabled, the document reveals information relating to COVID-19 safety, specifically about self-isolation and caring for individuals with COVID-19. Macros-enablement also spurs the document to execute an embedded macro that drops a file that performs a PowerShell process to drop the Nerbian RAT dropper in a 64-bit executable file called UpdateUAV.exe written in Go, researchers wrote.Go is becoming \u201can increasingly popular language used by threat actors, likely due to its lower barrier to entry and ease of use,\u201d they noted.Complexity and EvasionThe Nerbian RAT \u201cleverages multiple anti-analysis components spread across several stages, including multiple open-source libraries,\u201d researchers wrote.Indeed, the malware shows sophistication, working in three distinct phases. It starts with the aforementioned malicious document spread via phishing and then moves on, as described, to the UpdateUAV.exe dropper. The dropper performs various environment scans, such as anti-reversing and anti-VM checks, before executing the Nerbian RAT.Eventually, the RAT itself is executed via an encrypted configuration file, with \u201cextreme care\u201d taken to ensure data to command-and-control (C&C) is encrypted by sending it over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which evades inspection by network-scanning tools, researchers observed.In addition to communication with C&C, other typical RAT things that the malware can do include keylogging and screen capture, but with its own particular flair, they said. The RAT\u2019s keylogger stores keystrokes in encrypted form, while its screen-capturing tool works across all OS platforms.Extreme VettingPerhaps the most complex evasion functionality in the three-stage process is what happens before the dropper executes the Nerbian RAT. The dropper performs an extensive vetting of the compromised host and will stop execution if it encounters any of a number of conditions, researchers aid.These conditions include: the size of the hard disk on the system is less than a certain size, i.e., 100GB; the name of the hard disk, according to WMI , contains \u201cvirtual,\u201d \u201cvbox\u201d or \u201cvmware;\u201d the MAC address queried returns certain OUI values; or if any of a number of reverse engineering/debugging programs are encountered in the process list, researchers said.The dropper also halts execution if the DumpIt.exe, RAMMap.exe, RAMMap64.exe or vmmap.exe memory analysis/memory tampering programs are present in the process list; and if \u00a0the amount of time elapsed execution specific functions is deemed \u201cexcessive\u201d\u2014which would suggest debugging\u2013by a time measurement function present in the dropper.However, despite all this complexity to ensure the RAT isn\u2019t detected on its way to a victim\u2019s machine, \u201cthe dropper and the RAT itself do not employ heavy obfuscation outside of the sample being packed with UPX\u2013which it can be argued isn\u2019t necessarily for obfuscation, but to simply reduce the size of the executable,\u201d researchers noted.Researchers also found it easy to infer most of the functionality of both the RAT and the dropper due to the strings in the code referring to GitHub repositories that expose partial functionality of both the dropper and the RAT, they said.Malware",

        "raw text": "A popular mobile app in the official Google Play store called \u201cCraftsart Cartoon Photo Tools\u201d has racked up more than 100,000 installs \u2013 but unfortunately for the app\u2019s enthusiasts, it contains a version of the Facestealer Android malware.That\u2019s according to researchers at Pradeo, who said the app performs somewhat as promised, pretending to be a legitimate photo editing tool. Specifically, it claims to allow users to convert photos into cartoon or \u201cpainting\u201d-style versions using a few different filters. However, behind this mask lies a \u201csmall piece of [malicious] code that easily slips under the radar of store\u2019s safeguards,\u201d they explained.Facestealer is a known Android threat that has made its way into Google Play in the past via trojanized apps. According to past Malwarebytes analysis, when the application is first launched, it guides the user to the legitimate main Facebook login page and asks users to log in before they can use the app. Then, \u201cinjected malicious JavaScript steals the login credentials and sends them to a command-and-control server,\u201d according to the firm. \u201cThe C2 server makes use of login credentials to authorize access to the [account].\u201dSplash page for the Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools app, from Google Play.From there, the trojan is off to the data-stealing races: It lifts information from victims\u2019 Facebook accounts, including email addresses and IP addresses, phone numbers, conversations and messaging histories, credit-card details, friend lists and more.\u201cWhen your login credentials for a social-media account have been stolen this can have serious consequences,\u201d explained Pradeo researchers, in a Monday writeup. \u201cIt gives threat actors a base from which to gather more information.\u201d They added, \u201cFacebook credentials are used by cybercriminals to compromise accounts in multiple ways, the most common being to commit financial fraud, send phishing links and spread fake news.\u201dA Pradeo analysis of Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools found that the app makes connections to a Russian-registered domain that has been used for at least seven years as the command-and-control (C2) address for various malicious Android apps.\u201c[The domain] is connected to multiple malicious mobile applications that were at some points available on Google Play and later deleted,\u201d they explained. \u201cTo maintain a presence on Google Play, repackaging mobile apps is common practice for cybercriminals. Sometimes, we even observed cases in which repackaging was entirely automated.\u201dPradeo researchers said they alerted the Google Play team about the app, but as of Monday, it was still available in the official store. Obviously, users should delete the app immediately from their phones.Avoiding Google Play Malware Kaspersky, in a February posting, noted that malware was increasingly popping up in Google Play, using the same tactic that Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools uses.\u201cThe most common way to sneak malware onto Google Play is for a trojan to mimic a legitimate app already published on the site (for example, a photo editor or a VPN service) with the addition of a small piece of code to decrypt and launch a payload from the trojan\u2019s body or download it from the attackers\u2019 server,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cOften, to complicate dynamic analysis, unpacking actions are performed through commands from the attackers\u2019 server and in several steps: each decrypted module contains the address of the next one, plus instructions for decrypting it.\u201dUser should thus always be wary of any app with warning signs. In this current case, even though the app has managed to attract a large number of installs, there are definite red flags in the reviews.Some users flagged the forced Facebook login, commenting that it must be \u201csome kind of phishing.\u201d Others comments included, \u201cfake fake fake\u201d and \u201cvery very very bad app,\u201d which sum up the overall reactions of reviewers. Also, some noted that the functionality the app claims to have is limited or nonexistent \u2013 always a sign to stay away.In all, Craftsart Cartoon Photo Tools has a 2.1-star rating, with the majority of the reviews being one-star assessments, balanced out by a handful of obviously fake five-star reviews. There are no two-, three- or four-star ratings, which is clearly telling.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "The TeaBot banking trojan \u2013 also known as \u201cAnatsa\u201d \u2013 has been spotted on the Google Play store, researchers from Cleafy have discovered.The malware \u2013 designed to intercept SMS messages and login credentials from unwitting users \u2013 affected users of \u201cmore than 400 banking and financial apps, including those from Russia, China, and the U.S,\u201d its report claims.This isn\u2019t the first time TeaBot has terrorized Android users.TeaBot Just Won\u2019t DieTeaBot was first discovered last year. It\u2019s a relatively straightforward malware designed to siphon banking, contact, SMS and other types of private data from infected devices. What makes it unique \u2013 what gives it such staying power \u2013 is the clever means by which it spreads.TeaBot requires no malicious email or text message, no fraudulent website or third-party service. Instead, it typically comes packaged in a dropper application. Droppers are programs that seem legitimate from the outside, but in fact act as vehicles to deliver a second-stage malicious payload.TeaBot droppers have masked themselves as ordinary QR code or PDF readers. Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at Lookout, explained via email that attackers \u201cusually stick to utility apps like QR code scanners, flashlights, photo filters, or PDF scanners because these are apps that people download out of necessity and likely won\u2019t put as much time into looking at reviews that might impact their decision to download.\u201dThis tactic appears to be effective. In January, an app called QR Code Reader \u2013 Scanner App was distributing 17 different Teabot variants for a little over a month. It managed to pull in more than 100,000 downloads by the time it was discovered.Other TeaBot droppers \u2013 discovered by Dutch security firm ThreatFabric last November \u2013 have been packaged under many names, such as QR Scanner 2021, PDF Document Scanner and CryptoTracker. The latest, according to security firm Cleafy, was QR Code & Barcode \u2013 Scanner.Why Can\u2019t TeaBot Be Stopped?App stores have policies and protections aimed at combating malware. Google Play Protect, for example, helps root out malicious apps before they\u2019re installed and scans for evidence of misdoing on a daily basis.However, TeaBot droppers aren\u2019t obviously malicious. They might seem perfectly uninteresting, at least on the surface.Once a user opens one of these nondescript apps, they\u2019re prompted to download a software update. The update is, in fact, a second app containing a malicious payload.If the user gives their app permission to install software from an unknown source, the infection process begins. Like other Android malware, the TeaBot malware attempts to leverage Accessibility Services. Such attacks use an advanced remote access feature that abuses the TeamViewer application \u2013 a remote access and desktop sharing tool \u2013 giving the bad actor behind the malware remote control over the victim\u2019s devices.The ultimate goal of these attacks is to retrieve sensitive information such as login credentials, SMS and 2FA codes from the device\u2019s screen, as well as to perform malicious actions on the device, the report said.Here\u2019s How TeaBot Can Be StoppedTeaBot attacks have grown fast. As Cleafy notes, \u201cIn less than a year, the number of applications targeted by TeaBot have grown more than 500%, going from 60 targets to over 400.\u201dWhat can be done to stop them?\u201cReal-time scanning of app downloads \u2013 even if the app doesn\u2019t originate from Google Play \u2013 would help to mitigate this issue,\u201d Shawn Smith, director of infrastructure at nVisium, told Threatpost on Wednesday via email, adding that \u201cadditional warning messages when installing app add-ons that aren\u2019t on Google Play could be useful, too.\u201dLeo Pate, managing consultant at nVisium, also told Threatpost via email on Wednesday that \u201cGoogle could be implementing checks on permissive permissions for applications to run, obtaining lists of specific hardcoded public IPs and domain names. Then, [Google could run] them through various sources to see if they\u2019re \u2018bad.'\u201dUntil app stores have fixed the problem with droppers, users will have to remain alert, Schless noted. \u201cEveryone knows that they should have antivirus and anti-malware apps on their computers, and our mobile devices shouldn\u2019t be treated any differently.\u201dRegister Today for Log4j Exploit: Lessons Learned and Risk Reduction Best Practices \u2013 a LIVE Threatpost event sked for Thurs., March 10 at 2PM ET.

        "raw text": "Known Palestinian threat actor MoleRats is likely behind a recent malicious email campaign targeting Middle Eastern governments, foreign-policy think tanks and a state-affiliated airline with a new intelligence-gathering trojan dubbed NimbleMamba, researchers said.Researchers from Proofpoint said they have observed a spear-phishing campaign using multiple vectors since November that they believe is the work of TA402, more commonly known as\u00a0MoleRats\u00a0and linked to the Palestinian Territories, according to a report posted online Tuesday.The campaign uses various phishing lures and includes tactics not only to avoid being detected but also to ensure that its core malware payload only attacks specific targets, Proofpoint researchers wrote in the report. Some of the attacks observed by the team also delivered a secondary payload, a trojan dubbed BrittleBush, they said.NimbleMamba, delivered as an obfuscated .NET executable using third-party obfuscators, is an intelligence-gathering trojan researchers believe is a replacement for previous malware used by TA402, LastConn.\u201cNimbleMamba has the traditional capabilities of an intelligence-gathering trojan and is likely designed to be the initial access,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cFunctionalities include capturing screenshots and obtaining process information from the computer. Additionally, it can detect user interaction, such as looking for mouse movement.\u201dMoleRats is part of the Gaza Cybergang, an Arabic speaking, politically motivated collective of interrelated threat groups actively targeting the Middle East and North Africa. It\u2019s known for attacks using spyware and other malware aimed at gathering intelligence.Researchers from Zscaler have already observed MoleRats targeting prominent Palestinians, as well as activists and journalists in Turkey, with spyware in a previously identified attack in January. That campaign used malicious files doctored up to look like legitimate content related to the Israeli-Palestine conflict.Variations of an Espionage CampaignProofpoint outlined three types of emails using different tactics and URLs aimed at tricking victims into clicking on malicious links to download the ultimate payloads.One, which they observed in November, shows MoleRats pretending to be the Quora website while using an actor-controlled Gmail account with an actor-controlled domain, they said.The attack vector demonstrated a hallmark of the campaign, which is to use geofencing to target specific countries with the malicious payload rather than delivering it to everyone who clicks on the email\u2019s malicious link. The email appears to advertise Ugg boots for sale.\u201cThe malicious URL, such as https[:]//www[.]uggboots4sale[.]com/news15112021.php, in the phishing email was geofenced to the targeted countries,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201d If the target\u2019s IP address fits into the targeted region, the user would be redirected to the .RAR file download containing the latest TA402 implant, NimbleMamba. If outside the target area, the user would be redirected to a legitimate news site.\u201dThe second variation, called \u201cDropbox URL,\u201d was observed in December using \u201cmultiple phishing pretenses, including clickbait medical lures and ones allegedly sharing confidential geopolitical information,\u201d researchers wrote.This variation also used a Gmail account controlled by TA402 to send the email, but shifted to Dropbox URLs to deliver the malicious .RAR files containing NimbleMamba. It also abandoned the use of geofencing, they said.Moreover, in this variation, researchers noticed that the threat actor also was using the cloud-based file-sharing service Dropbox for malware command and control (C2), which prompted them to notify Dropbox of the malicious activity so they could put an end to it, they said. MoleRats was seen using Dropbox for C2 in its previously identified attacks in January.The third email used by attackers, observed in December and January, used socially engineered content specifically to lure targets. However, in this variation, MoleRats \u201cslightly adjusted their attack chain by inserting an additional actor-controlled WordPress URL,\u201d researchers wrote.The WordPress site impersonates a news aggregator of the legitimate news site used in the first campaign variation, and likely redirects to the download site of the malicious .RAR files containing NimbleMamba if someone in the targeted region clicks on the link, researchers said.\u201cIf the source IP address does not align with the target region, the URL will redirect the recipient to a benign website, typically an Arabic-language news website,\u201d they added.NimbleMamba in DepthThe most frequently delivered payload of the campaign, NimbleMamba, has some similarities between TA402\u2019s previously used deliverable, LastConn, but also some notable differences, researchers observed.Both executables are written in C#, have base64 encoding within the C2 framework and use the Dropbox API for C2 communication. However, \u00a0there appears to be little code overlap between the two, they said.NimbleMamba\u2019s use of guardrails to ensure that all infected victims are within TA402\u2019s target region also is unique, as is its use of the Dropbox API for both C2 as well as exfiltration, researchers wrote in the post.\u201cThe malware also contains multiple capabilities designed to complicate both automated and manual analysis,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBased on this, Proofpoint assesses NimbleMamba is actively being developed, is well-maintained, and designed for use in highly targeted intelligence collection campaigns.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentMalwarePrivacyWeb Security",

        "raw text": "After remaining available for more than two weeks, a malicious two-factor authentication (2FA) application has been removed from Google Play \u2014 but not before it was downloaded more than 10,000 times. The app, which is fully functional as a 2FA authenticator, comes loaded with the Vultur stealer malware that targets and swoops down on financial data.Users with the malicious application, straightforwardly called \u201c2FA Authenticator,\u201d are advised by researchers at Pradeo to delete it from their device immediately since they still remain at risk \u2014 both from banking-login theft and other attacks made possible by the app\u2019s extensive overpermissions.The threat actors developed an operational and convincing application to disguise the malware dropper, using open-source Aegis authentication code injected with malicious add-ons. That helped it spread via Google Play undetected, according to a Pradeo report released on Thursday.\u201cAs a result, the application is successfully disguised as an authentication tool, which ensures it maintains a low profile,\u201d the report added.Vultur Banking Trojan Gobbles Down PermissionsOnce downloaded, the app installs Vultur banking trojan, which steals financial and banking data on the compromised device \u2014 but can do much more.First detected by analysts at ThreatFabric last March, the Vultur remote access trojan (RAT) malware was the first of its kind found to use keylogging and screen recording as its primary tactic for banking-data theft, enabling the group to automate the process of harvesting credentials and scale.Faux 2FA app takes flight with Vultur trojan. Source: Pradeo.\u201cThe actors chose to steer away from the common HTML overlay strategy we usually see in other Android banking trojans: this approach usually requires more time and effort from the actors in order to steal relevant information from the user. Instead, they chose to simply record what is shown on the screen, effectively obtaining the same end result,\u201d ThreatFabric said at the time.The scam 2FA authenticator also asks for device permissions beyond what was disclosed in the Google Play profile, the Pradeo team said.Those sneaky, elevated privileges allow the attackers to perform various functions beyond the standard banking-trojan fare, such as: Accessing user location data, so attacks can be targeted at specific regions; disabling the device lock and password security; downloading third-party applications; and taking over control of the device, even if the app is shut down, the report explained.Pradeo uncovered another dirty trick the malicious 2FA pulled by grabbing the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, which gives the app the ability to change other mobile apps\u2019 interfaces. As Google itself explained, \u201cVery few apps should use this permission; these windows are intended for system-level interaction with the user.\u201dOnce the device is fully compromised, the app installs Vultur, \u201can advanced and relatively new kind of malware that mostly targets online banking interface to steal users\u2019 credentials and other critical financial information,\u201d the report said.The team at Pradeo reported that while the researchers submitted their disclosure to Google Play, nevertheless the malicious 2FA Authenticator app loaded with the banking trojan remained available for 15 days.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "New variants of the BRATA banking trojan have been targeting global Android devices since November with advanced features, including the ability to wipe devices after stealing user data, tracking devices via GPS, and novel obfuscation techniques, researchers have found.The remote access trojan (RAT), which targets banks and financial institutions, is now being distributed through a downloader to avoid being detected by antivirus (AV) solutions, researchers from fraud-management firm Cleafy wrote in a report published Monday. The malware is currently targeting banks and financial institutions in Italy, Latin America, Poland and the United Kingdom, they said.Researchers from Kaspersky discovered BRATA in January 2019, proliferating via the Google Play store and initially targeting users in Brazil. The RAT featured the unique capability of collecting and relaying banking info to its operators in real time.Since then, the actors behind the RAT have continued to target financial institutions and add new capabilities to the malware. The Cleafy team has identified three new variants of BRATA that have been delivered via two new waves of samples in the last few months, researchers reported.\u201cThe first wave started in November 2021, and the second around mid-December 2021,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cDuring the second wave, [threat actors] began to deliver a few new tailored variants of BRATA in different countries.\u201dNew Variants, Wiper CapabilitiesThe most prevalent of the variants observed by researchers is BRATA.A, which has two key new features, researchers reported. One is GPS tracking of victim devices, a capability that \u201cappears to be still under development,\u201d researchers wrote. The RAT requests permission to use GPS at installation, but does not appear to actually use it during execution, they said.\u201cFor this reason, we could just guess that malware developers are requesting this permission for future development, most likely to target people that belong to specific countries or to enable other cash-out mechanisms (e.g. cardless ATMs),\u201d they wrote.BRATA.A also features a \u201ckill switch\u201d that serves to perform a factory reset of the device in two scenarios, researchers said.The first is after a bank fraud has been completed successfully, they said. \u201cIn this way, the victim is going to lose even more time before understanding that a malicious action happened,\u201d researchers wrote.The second case in which BRATA wipes a device is when the application is installed in a virtual environment, as the RAT \u201ctries to prevent dynamic analysis through the execution of this feature,\u201d researchers wrote.The second new variant observed by the team, BRATA.B, is nearly identical to the A variant except for \u201cparticular obfuscation of the code and the use of tailored overlay pages used to steal the security number (or PIN) of the targeted banking application, according to Cleafy.Avoiding DetectionBRATA.C is the third new variant and shows evolution in the method its operators use to avoid the RAT being detected upon installation by users.The variant uses an initial dropper to download and execute the \u201creal\u201d malicious app later, demonstrating a unique way that deviates from how other Android banking trojans actors try to evade detection by AV solutions, researchers wrote.\u201cAlthough the majority of Android banking trojans try to obfuscate/encrypt the malware core in an external file (eg. .DEX or .JAR), BRATA uses a minimal app to download in a second step the core BRATA app (.APK),\u201d they explained in the post.After the victim installs the downloader app, it requires the acceptance of just one permission to download and install the malicious application from an untrusted source, researchers said.\u201cWhen the victim clicks on the install button, the downloader app sends a GET request to the command-and-control (C2) server to download the malicious .APK,\u201d they explained. \u201cAt this point, the victim has two malicious apps installed on their device.\u201dOverall, Cleafy\u2019s latest findings demonstrate that BRATA operators aim to expand their regional scope of targets as well as plan to evolve the malware further, with little sign of letting up in the near future, researchers said.\u201cWe can expect BRATA to keep staying undetected and to keep developing new features,\u201d they wrote.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareMobile Security",

And it\u2019s not just customers of big banks at risk, the researchers added: Virtual payment platforms and crypto wallets are also being targeted.\n\u201cAs a banking trojan malware, Anubis\u2019 goal is to collect significant data about the victim from their mobile device for financial gain,\u201d the Lookout report said. \u201cThis is done by intercepting SMSs, keylogging, file exfiltration, screen monitoring, GPS data collection and abuse of the device\u2019s accessibility services.\u201dThe malicious version of the Orange Telecom account management app was submitted to the Google Play store in July 2021 and later removed, but the researchers warned that they believe this campaign was just a test of Google\u2019s antivirus protections and will likely resurface soon.\u201cWe found that obfuscation efforts were only partially implemented within the app and that there were additional developments still occurring with its command-and-control (C2) server,\u201d the report added. \u201cWe expect more heavily obfuscated distributions will be submitted in the future.\u201dNew Anubis Tricks Once downloaded on the device, the banking trojan makes a connection with the command-and-control (C2) server and downloads another application to initiate the SOCKS5 proxy.\u201cThis proxy allows the attacker to enforce authentication for clients communicating with their server and mask communications between the client and C2. Once retrieved and decrypted, the APK is saved as \u2018FR.apk\u2019 in \u2018/data/data/fr.orange.serviceapp/app_apk,'\u201d the researchers wrote.A scam message then pops up asking the user to disable Google Play Protect, giving the attacker full control, the report said.The analysts found more than 394 unique apps targeted by fr.orange.serviceapp, including banks, reloadable card companies and cryptocurrency wallets. The Lookout team traced the Anubis client to a half-built crypto trading platform.First identified in 2016, Anubis is widely available on underground forums as open-source code along with instructions for aspiring banking trojan cybercriminals, the report explained. In this latest iteration of Anubis code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise.The Lookout team couldn\u2019t find any successful attack associated with the Orange S.A. campaign, Kristina Balaam, a threat researcher with Lookout, told Threatpost.\u201cWhile we can\u2019t be certain whether the app has been used in a successful attack, we do know they are targeting U.S. banks including Bank of America, U.S. Bank, Capital One, Chase, SunTrust and Wells Fargo,\u201d Balaam said.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Overcoming Google Play app restrictions, attackers have successfully racked up more than 300,000 banking trojan installations over just the past four months in the official Android app marketplace.Researchers from Threat Fabric reported that these threat groups have honed their ability to use Google Play to propagate banking trojans by shrinking the footprint of their dropper apps, eliminating the number of permissions they ask for, boosting the overall quality of the attack with better code and standing up convincing companion websites.Droppers are apps that act as first-stage implants, whose job it is to fetch and install other, final payloads \u2014 in this case, banking trojans. The report offered the example of cyberattackers\u2019 ingenuity in sneaking these onto Google Play: A dropper app disguised as a fitness service with an actual functioning back-end site to match.\u201cTo make themselves even more difficult to detect, the actors behind these dropper apps only manually activate the installation of the banking trojan on an infected device in case they desire more victims in a specific region of the world,\u201d the Threat Fabric researchers added. \u201cThis makes automated detection a much harder strategy to adopt by any organization.\u201dAll 300,000 banking-trojan dropper installations came from four malware families, according to the report: Anatsa (200,000+ installs); Alien (95,000+) and Hydra/Ermac (15,000+).Anasta Installs Anasta threat actors were first observed by Threat Fabric using Google Play malware dropper apps in Jan. 2021, the report said. The Anasta banking trojan does it all \u2014 credential theft, keylogging and even captures what\u2019s shown on a user\u2019s screen. The analysts found six separate droppers in Google Play that lead to Anasta infections, including scam QR code scammers, PDF scanners and cryptocurrency apps, collectively reaching more than 100,000 installations, they reported.Source: Threat Fabric.Once the app is downloaded and installed from Google Play, to continue, the user must allow an update, which is instead the Anatsa malware.\u201cActors behind it took care in making their apps look legitimate and useful,\u201d the analysts said. \u201cThere are large numbers of positive reviews for the apps. The number of installations and presence of reviews may convince Android users to install the app. Moreover, these apps indeed possess the claimed functionality, after installation they do operate normally and further convince victim in their legitimacy.\u201dHydra, Ermac and Alien Installs \u00a0Threat group Brunhilda was observed using a fake QR-code app to distribute both Hydra and Ermac malware families, the report added.And, a dropper app called \u201cGymDrop\u201d used \u201cexercise update\u201d messages to trick victims into downloading the Alien banking trojan.\u201cThe Alien samples of this campaign connect to the same C2 as samples from previously described campaign powered by Brunhilda dropper,\u201d the report said.As these groups evolve, they\u2019ve been able to develop an effective work around automated and machine learning detection, the report explained.As Google Play continues to be reactive in its approach to weeding out these malicious actors, there\u2019s a limit to the amount of protection that can be provided to users, John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich told Threatpost.\u201cThere is only so much protection you can have when app stores are inherently reactive in detecting abusive apps,\u201d Bambenek said. \u201cThe same benefit application developers have in choosing the Android ecosystem are the same benefits criminals are going to use.\u201dThere\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.\u00a0REGISTER TODAY\u00a0to learn key concepts of natural language processing (NLP) and how to use it to navigate the data ocean and add context to cybersecurity threats (without being an expert!).

        "raw text": "The Mekotio Latin American banking trojan is bouncing back after several of the gang that operates it were arrested in Spain. More than 100 attacks in recent weeks have featured a new infection routine, indicating that the group continues to actively retool.\u201cThe new campaign started right after the Spanish Civil Guard announced the arrest of 16 people involved with Mekotio [aka Metamorfo] distribution in July,\u201d according to Check Point Research (CPR). \u201cIt appears that the gang behind the malware were able to narrow the gap quickly and change tactics to avoid detection.\u201dMekotio, like other Latin American banking trojans, steals online banking logins and other financial credentials from unsuspecting victims. But they\u2019re constantly evolving to avoid detection. In this case, the freshened-up Mekotio infection vector contains \u201cunprecedented elements\u201d to keep detection rates low, according to the firm\u2019s analysis, issued Wednesday. These are:A stealthier batch file with at least two layers of obfuscation;New fileless PowerShell script that runs directly in memory; andUse of Themida v3 for packing the final DLL payload.\u201cIn the last three months, we saw approximately 100 attacks use new, simple obfuscation techniques, with the help of a substitution cipher, to hide the first module of the attack,\u201d according to CPR. \u201cThis simple obfuscation technique allows it to go undetected by most of the antivirus products.\u201dLayers and Layers in the Malware DeploymentThe attacks are multistage in all phases, and they begin with Spanish-language phishing emails containing a .ZIP archive link or .ZIP file attachment. The lure is a claim that the email contains a digital tax receipt pending submission.If a user is duped into clicking on either form of .ZIP file, the aforementioned stealthy batch file executes. In turn, it issues a PowerShell command to download and run a PowerShell script in memory.The batch file has two layers of obfuscation and often contains a file name that starts with \u201cContacto,\u201d according to CPR.\u201cThe first layer of the obfuscation is a simple substitution cipher,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cSubstitution ciphers encrypt plaintext by replacing each symbol in the plaintext with the corresponding symbol from the lookup table.\u201dThe second layer of obfuscation is a technique that takes slices of the command code and saves them in different environment variables. When these are concatenated, the PowerShell command emerges that downloads the PowerShell script.The PowerShell script is responsible for conducting pre-infection checks, i.e., determining if the target is located in a desired geography within Latin America (Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Spain or Peru), and verifying that it\u2019s not running in a virtual machine/sandbox environment.\u201cThe next thing the script does is to create an empty file, used as a footprint, whose name is the current date,\u201d according to the firm. \u201cThis lets it know if it already ran in the system. If the file already exists, the script stops the execution.\u201dAfter that, it establishes persistence (by adding a new value to the following registry key: \u201cHKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\u201d); and then it downloads a secondary .ZIP archive to the ProgramData Directory.That secondary .ZIP archive contains three files, which are extracted, renamed and saved in a new directory on the infected system. The PowerShell script checks the size of the extracted files to distinguish between the type and the purpose of the files.The first file is an interpreter for AutoHotkey (AHK), which is an open-source scripting language for Windows that lets users create shortcuts to files. The malware added its use of AHK to the mix last March as yet another evasion tactic.The PowerShell script uses the interpreter to run a second file, which is an AHK script; and the AHK script then runs the third file, which is the Mekotio payload (in the form of a DLL packed with Themida v3).Themida is a legitimate software protector/encryptor that was originally created to keep a cyberattacker from directly inspecting or modifying the code of a compiled application.Once unpacked, \u201cthe DLL contains the main Mekotio banker functionality for actions such as stealing access credentials for electronic banking portals and a password stealer,\u201d according to CPR analysis. \u201cThe stolen data is sent to the command-and-control server.\u201dWhile banking trojans targeting Latin America are common, they\u2019re interesting to analyze because they tend to be modular, meaning that attackers can make small tweaks in order to stay off the detection radar, researchers noted.\u201cCPR sees a lot of old malicious code used for a long time, and yet the attacks manage to stay under the radar of antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions by changing packers or obfuscation techniques such as a substitution cipher,\u201d they said. \u201cOur analysis of this campaign highlights the efforts that attackers make to conceal their malicious intentions, bypass security filtering and trick users.\u201dHow to Protect Against Banking TrojansTo protect against this type of attack, CPR offered the following basic anti-social-engineering tips:Be suspicious of any email or communication from a familiar brand or organization that asks you to click on a link or open an attached document;Beware of lookalike domains, spelling errors in emails or websites, and unfamiliar email senders;Be cautious with files received via email from unknown senders, especially if they prompt for a certain action you would not usually do;Don\u2019t click on promotional links in emails, and instead, Google the vendor and click the link from the Google results page;Beware of \u201cspecial\u201d offers that don\u2019t appear to be reliable or trustworthy purchase opportunities; andDon\u2019t reuse passwords between different applications and accounts.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Researchers have found a new way to encode potentially evil source code, such that human reviewers see a harmless version and compilers see the invisible, wicked version.Named \u201cTrojan Source attacks,\u201d the method \u201cexploits subtleties in text-encoding standards such as Unicode to produce source code whose tokens are logically encoded in a different order from the one in which they are displayed, leading to vulnerabilities that cannot be perceived directly by human code reviewers,\u201d Cambridge University researchers Nicholas Boucher and Ross Anderson said in a paper (PDF) published on Monday.Boucher and Anderson said that the attacks jeopardize all source code, posing \u201can immediate threat both to first-party software and of supply-chain compromise across the industry.\u201d They\u2019ve published working proofs of concept (PoCs) of attacks in the C, C++, C#, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Go and Python programming languages, though the researchers note that they suspect that the attack will also work against \u201cmost other modern languages.\u201dCoordinated Disclosure for Two CVEsThe researchers have coordinated disclosure with 19 organizations, many of which are now releasing updates to address the security weakness in code compilers, interpreters, code editors and repositories. Some of those organizations dismissed the notification because it didn\u2019t match vulnerabilities with which they\u2019re more familiar, the researchers noted.There are two CVEs involved, both of which MITRE issued against the Unicode specification. What the researchers called a \u201cpotentially devastating\u201d attack against the Unicode bidirectional algorithm (BiDi) through version 14.0 is tracked as CVE-2021-42574. BiDi handles the order in which text displays \u2013 for example, from left to right with the Latin alphabet, or from right to left with Arabic or Hebrew characters.A related attack relies on the use of visually similar characters, known as homoglyphs, tracked as CVE-2021-42694.With regards to the BiDi attack, the paper explains that computer systems need a deterministic way to resolve conflicting directionality when it comes to mixed scripts \u2013 i.e., Latin scripts mixed in with Arabic \u2013 that have conflicting display orders.In Unicode, that conflict is typically handled by the BiDi algorithm. But sometimes, the algorithm doesn\u2019t suffice, in which case Unicode uses override control characters that insert invisible characters to enable the switching of character display ordering.The Old Unicode Right-to-Left Override ShtickThe Unicode BiDi override trick \u2013 known as the right-to-left (RLO) technique \u2013 is an old attack that keeps getting dusted off. The overrides enable even single-script characters to be displayed in an order that\u2019s different from their logical encoding, the researchers explained \u2013 a fact that\u2019s previously been exploited to disguise the real name of a malicious executable spread via email or, in one 2013 attack, a registry key.More recently, in 2018, attackers used RLO to deliver cryptomining malware by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the Telegram messaging application, as Kaspersky researchers detailed at the time.What makes these attacks possible is that most \u201cwell-designed\u201d programming languages shun arbitrary control characters found in source code, since they screw up the logic, the researchers explained. Random BiDi override characters will typically result in a compiler or interpreter syntax error \u2013 errors that are avoided by tucking them into comments or strings, both of which are ignored by compilers and interpreters.\u201cWhile both comments and strings will have syntax-specific semantics indicating their start and end, these bounds are not respected by Bidi overrides,\u201d according to the writeup. \u201cTherefore, by placing Bidi override characters exclusively within comments and strings, we can smuggle them into source code in a manner that most compilers will accept.\u201dNovel Supply-Chain AttackThe researchers suggested that if you put it all together, you get the ability to create perfectly valid, perfectly malicious source code that could be used to create a novel supply-chain attack that can be carried out on source code.\u201cBy injecting Unicode Bidi override characters into comments and strings, an adversary can produce syntactically-valid source code in most modern languages for which the display order of characters presents logic that diverges from the real logic,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIn effect, we anagram program A into program B.\u201dSuch an attack would be tough for a human code reviewer to detect, given how kosher the rendered source code looks. \u201cIf the change in logic is subtle enough to go undetected in subsequent testing, an adversary could introduce targeted vulnerabilities without being detected,\u201d they continued.But wait, it gets worse: the paper cautioned: Bidi override characters persist in copy-and-paste functions on most modern browsers, editors and operating systems, meaning that \u201cany developer who copies code from an untrusted source into a protected code base may inadvertently introduce an invisible vulnerability.\u201dThat kind of dangerous code copying has happened before in real-world security exploits, the researchers noted. One example was in June 2020, when at least 26 open-source code repositories were found to be infected with Octopus Scanner malware, which targets the Apache NetBeans Java integrated development environment (IDE) and was found nesting in GitHub source-code repositories, just waiting to take over developer machines.The sheer amount of copying and pasting from GitHub, Stack Overflow and other repositories makes this a real possibility as an attack vector, experts say.John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at digital IT and security operations company Netenrich, told Threatpost on Monday that it would be a \u201cfairly difficult attack flow\u201d to discretely maintain, but the type of threat actor that can poison a supply chain are the ones who are slick enough to worry about. \u201cSoftware engineering companies should \u2026 update their compilers as soon as possible because the groups that engage in supply chain compromise are the exact groups who both have the sophistication to manage this attack flow and the desire to use such techniques,\u201d he said via email.How Do You Mitigate What\u2019s Invisible?Jon Gaines, senior application security consultant at application security provider nVisium, said that this scenario demonstrates how unwise it can be to copy and paste code.It\u2019s always better to rewrite it yourself, he told Threatpost on Monday, and suggested enabling IDE or text editors to display Unicode.Alternatively, if you are copying and pasting code, Gaines suggested opening up the code you copied and pasted within a hex editor to check it. \u201cHopefully patches will be promptly released for most compilers, but in the interim, this would be an effective short-term solution,\u201d he said via email.Homoglyph Attacks Are Even WorseThe Trojan Source attacks that rely on BiDi RLO can become even worse if an attacker switches to using homoglyphs, the researchers noted. An early example is a July 2020 campaign in which spammers tried to trick users into disclosing their PayPal passwords by switching the lowercase \u201cl\u201d in the brand name to the visually similar uppercase \u201cI.\u201d\u201cThese domain attacks become even more severe with the introduction of Unicode, which has a much larger set of visually similar characters, or homoglyphs, than ASCII,\u201d the researchers warned \u2013 making homoglyph attacks a favorite of spammers a la the \u201cPaypai\u201d scammers. Homoglyphs being used in URLs is a recognized danger \u2013 one that Unicode has focused on in security reports such as this one.\u201cThe fact that the Trojan Source vulnerability affects almost all computer languages makes it a rare opportunity for a system-wide and ecologically valid cross-platform and cross-vendor comparison of responses,\u201d the researchers noted. \u201cAs powerful supply-chain attacks can be launched easily using these techniques, it is essential for organizations that participate in a software supply chain to implement defenses.\u201dMatthew Green, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, told KrebsOnSecurity that the possibility of exploiting Unicode isn\u2019t surprising, but the fact that so many compilers \u201chappily parse Unicode without any defenses, and how effective their right-to-left encoding technique is at sneaking code into codebases,\u201d does take him aback.. \u201cThat\u2019s a really clever trick I didn\u2019t even know was possible. Yikes,\u201d he told security journalist Brian Krebs.On the plus side, the researchers conducted a widespread vulnerability scan that didn\u2019t turn up any evidence that the security weakness has been exploited so far. On the scary side, there\u2019s no defenses against Trojan Source, Green said, so we should all pray that compiler and code editor developers patch quickly.110121 14:44 UPDATE: Added input from Jon Gaines and John Bambenek.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.VulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "More than 10 million Android users have been saddled with a malware called GriftHorse that\u2019s trojanizing various applications and secretly subscribing victims to premium mobile services \u2013 a type of billing fraud that researchers categorize as \u201cfleeceware.\u201dZimperium uncovered more than 130 GriftHorse apps being distributed through both Google Play and third-party application stores, across all categories. Some of them have basic functionality, and some of them do nothing, researchers said. In either case, once installed, they lead to victims being billed for premium services \u2013 but phone-owners are usually none the wiser until they take a look at their mobile bills.GriftHorse rode onto the scene in November of last year, and by now, \u201cthe total amount stolen could be well into the hundreds of millions of Euros,\u201d according to Zimperium researchers, with each victim paying upwards of $40 per month.Victims sprawl across 70 different countries, all packing sneaky extra charges that they may not be aware of. Google removed the flagged apps, but GriftHorse is far from corralled: There could be additional Play apps, installs could still be active on peoples\u2019 phones, and the apps remain in many unofficial stores.Distribution of GriftHorse Android malware victims. Source: Zimperium.If users are unlucky enough to download one of the apps, they\u2019ll find themselves \u201cbombarded with alerts on the screen letting them know they had won a prize and need to claim it immediately,\u201d according to Zimperium\u2019s Wednesday analysis. \u201cThese pop ups reappear no less than five times per hour until the application user successfully accepts the offer.\u201dThis is where it gets sneaky: Upon accepting the invitation for the prize, the malware serves victims selective pages, based on the geolocation of their IP addresses, using the local language and targeted verbiage. Those pages are also dynamically generated to avoid the blacklisting of strings by security solutions.\u201cThese cybercriminals took great care not to get caught by malware researchers by avoiding hardcoding URLs or reusing the same domains, and filtering/serving the malicious payload based on the originating IP address\u2019s geolocation,\u201d according to the researchers. \u201cThis method allowed the attackers to target different countries in different ways. This check on the server-side evades dynamic analysis checking for network communication and behaviors.\u201dThe redirect page asks targets to submit their phone numbers for \u201cverification.\u201d In reality, typing in the numbers merely subscribes them to a premium SMS service that charges $42 on average per month (\u20ac36), which will show up on their phone bills.Looking GriftHorse in the MouthThe creators of the apps have employed several novel techniques to help the apps stay off the radar of security vendors, the analysis found. In addition to the no-reuse policy for URLs mentioned above, the cybercriminals are also developing the apps using Apache Cordova.Cordova allows developers to use standard web technologies \u2013 HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript \u2013 for cross-platform mobile development \u2013 which in turn allows them to push out updates to apps without requiring user interaction.\u201c[This] technology can be abused to host the malicious code on the server and develop an application that executes this code in real-time,\u201d according to Zimperium. \u201cThe application displays as a web page that references HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images.\u201dThe campaign is also supported with a sophisticated architecture and plenty of encryption, which makes detection more difficult, according to the researchers.For instance, when an app is launched, the encrypted files stored in the \u201cassets/www\u201d folder are decrypted using AES. After a bit more unpacking, the core functionality source code uses the GetData() function to establish communication between the application and a first-stage command-and-control (C2) server by encrypting an HTTP POST request.The app then receives an encrypted response, which is decrypted using AES to collect a second-stage C2 URL. It also executes a GET request using Cordova\u2019s \u201cInAppBrowser\u201d function to uncover a third-stage URL, and it starts pushing user notifications about the supposed \u201cprize\u201d once an hour, five times in a row, according to the analysis.\u201cThe second-stage C2 domain is always the same irrespective of the application or the geolocation of the victim,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThe third-stage URL displays the final page asking for the victim\u2019s phone number and subscribes to several paid services and premium subscriptions.\u201dJavaScript code embedded in the page is responsible for the malicious behavior of the application, researchers added: \u201cThe interaction between the WebPage and the in-app functions is facilitated by the JavaScript Interface, which allows JavaScript code inside a WebView to trigger actions in the native (application-level) code. This can include the collection of data about the device, including IMEI and IMSI among others.\u201dAndroid Fleeceware Continues to Plague UsersGriftHorse is not the only malware that looks to defraud victims via trojanized apps. The well-documented Joker malware, for example, has been circulating since 2017, disguising itself within hundreds of common, legitimate apps like camera apps, games, messengers, photo editors, translators and wallpapers.Once installed, Joker silently simulates clicks and intercepts SMS messages to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 subscribe victims to unwanted, paid premium services controlled by the attackers. The apps also steal SMS messages, contact lists and device information.GriftHorse takes a slightly different approach than Joker, but Zimperium warned that it\u2019s just as virulent.Source: Zimperium.\u201cThe threat actors have exerted substantial effort to maximize their presence in the Android ecosystem through a large number of applications, developer accounts and domains,\u201d they said. \u201cThe GriftHorse campaign is one of the most widespread campaigns the zLabs threat research team has witnessed in 2021. The cybercriminal group behind the GriftHorse campaign has built a stable cash flow of illicit funds from these victims, generating millions in recurring revenue each month with the total amount stolen potentially well into the hundreds of millions.\u201dDetected GriftHorse Apps100% Projector for Mobile Phone3D Camera To PlanAmazing Sticky Slime Simulator ASMR\\u200fAmazing Video EditorAR Phone Booster \u2013 Battery SaverBag X-Ray 100% ScannerBattery Live Wallpaper 4KBus \u2013 Metrolis 2021Bus Driving SimulatorCall Blocker-Spam Call BlockerCall Blocker-Spam Call BlockerCall Recoder ProCall Record ProCall Recorder iCallCaller ID & Spam BlockerCallerIDCaller-xCallHelp: Second Phone NumberChat Translator All MessengersCIAO \u2013 Live Video ChatCinema Hall: Free HD MoviesClapClap To Find My PhoneClipBuddyColor Call ChangerCoupons & Gifts: InstaShopCutCut ProDaily Horoscope & Life PalmestryDating App \u2013 Sweet MeetEasy Bass BoosterEasy TV ShowEla-Salaty: Muslim Prayer Times & Qibla DirectionEnglish Arabic Translator directFace AnalyzerFastPulse \u2013 Heart Rate MonitorFindContactFingerprint ChangerFingerprint DefenderFitness PointFitness TrainerForza H Mobile 4 Ultimate EditionFree Calls WorldWideFree Coupons 2021Free Islamic Stickers 2021Free Translator PhotoFX KeyboardGeospot: GPS Location TrackerGetContacterGPS Phone Tracker \u2013 Family LocatorHandy Translator ProHeart Rate and Meal TrackerHeart Rate and Pulse TrackerHeart Rate Pro Health MonitorHeart RhythmHOO Live \u2013 Meet and ChatHoroscope : FortuneHunt ContactiCare \u2013 Find LocationiConnected TrackerIconyIdle Gun Tycoo\\u202an\\u202cInstant Speech TranslationIntelligent Translator ProiSalam Qibla CompassiTranslator_ Text & Voice & PhotoKeyboard ThemesKeyboard: Virtual Projector AppKFC Saudi \u2013 Get free delivery and 50% off couponsLanguage Translator-Easy&FastLauncher iOS 15Launcher iOS for AndroidLifeel \u2013 scan and testLive Mobile Number TrackerLive Wallpaper & BackgroundLoca \u2013 Find LocationLocatoria \u2013 Find LocationLocker ToolLudo Game ClassicLudo Speak v2.0Mine Easy TranslatorMobile Things FinderMy Chat TranslatorMy Locator PlusOFFRoaders \u2013 SurviveParallax paper 3DPhone Caller Screen 2021Phone Finder by ClappingPhone Search by ClapPhoneControl Block Spam CallsPhoto Effect ProPhoto LabPiano Bot Easy LessonsPikCho Editor appPlant Camera IdentifierPony Video Chat-Live StreamProof-CallerProokie-Cartoon Photo EditorPulse App \u2013 Heart Rate MonitorQibla AR ProQibla CompassQibla Compass (Kaaba Locator)Qibla correct Quran Coran KoranQibla direction watch (compass)Qibla Finder \u2013 Qibla DirectionQibla Pass DirectionQibla UltimateQR Code Reader \u2013 Barcode ScannerQR Reader ProR Circle \u2013 Location FinderRacers Car DriverSafe LockScanner App Scan Docs & NotesScanner Pro App: PDF DocumentScreen Mirroring TV CastSecond Translate PROSkycoachSlime SimulatorSmart Call RecorderSmart Spot LocatorSnapLens \u2013 Photo TranslatorSoul Scanner \u2013 Check YourSquishy and Pop itStickers Maker for WhatsAppStreet Cars: pro RacingTagsContactTranslate It \u2013 Online AppTruck \u2013 RoudDrive OffroadTrueCaller & TrueRecoderVector artsVideo & Photo Recovery Manager 2VPN Zone \u2013 Fast & Easy ProxyWhat\u2019s Me StickerWiFi Unlock Password Pro XYou FrameZodiac : Hand\u0411\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044b 24\\7Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

The malware is looking to incorporate distributed denial of service (DDoS), man in the middle (MiTM) and ransomware functionality into its arsenal \u2013 on top of existing banking overlay, notification manipulation and keylogging services.According to researchers from ThreatFabric, the malware\u2019s authors are shooting for the moon on this one.\u201cThis malware is still in its infancy [first appearing in August, now only on version 2] and it is undergoing a testing phase\u2026prospecting serious and worrying plans for the near future,\u201d they said in a Friday analysis, noting that the malware\u2019s roadmap is laid out in underground forum posts advertising its availability for testing.\u201cSOVA is\u2026taking a page out of traditional desktop malware,\u201d they added. \u201cIncluding DDoS, man in the middle and ransomware to its arsenal could mean incredible damage to end users, in addition to the already very dangerous threat that overlay and keylogging attacks serve.\u201dThe malware authors\u2019 coding and development choices also speak to SOVA\u2019s sophistication, the analysis showed.\u201cRegarding the development, SOVA also stands out for being fully developed in Kotlin, a coding language supported by Android and thought by many to be the future of Android development,\u201d according to ThreatFabric. \u201cIf the author\u2019s promises on future features are kept, SOVA could potentially be the most complete and advanced Android bot to be fully developed in Kotlin to this day.\u201dSOVA meanwhile relies on the legitimate open-source project known as RetroFit for its communication with the command-and-control (C2) server.\u201cRetrofit is a type-safe REST client for Android, Java and Kotlin developed by Square,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThe library provides a powerful framework for authenticating and interacting with APIs and sending network requests with OkHttp.\u201dBanking Trojan FeaturesSOVA is first and foremost a banking trojan, and its authors are applying innovation to this portion of its development too, researchers noted. For instance, SOVA doesn\u2019t skimp on the more traditional banking front of overlay attacks.Overlay attacks are a common tactic used by banking trojans, in which the malware replaces the screen that users see when they log into mobile banking with a copycat screen \u2013 thus harvesting any credentials the victim puts in.In SOVA\u2019s case, the targets that it\u2019s capable of imitating include banking applications, cryptocurrency wallets and shopping applications that require credit-card access to operate.\u201cAccording to the authors, there are already multiple overlays available for different banking institutions from the U.S. and Spain, but they offer the possibility of creating more in case of necessity from the buyer,\u201d researchers noted. Also, version 2 contains functionality to target users of some Russian banks \u2013 drawing ire from other forum users, ThreatFabric reported.To better gather the victim\u2019s credentials and other personally identifiable information (PII), SOVA is banking (so to speak) on Android\u2019s Accessibility Services \u2013 also a traditional functionality.\u201cWhen it is started for the first time, the malware hides its app icon and abuses the Accessibility Services to obtain all the necessary permissions to operate properly,\u201d researchers explained. Some of those permissions allow it to intercept for SMS messages and notifications for instance, to better hide from the victim \u2013 and on the roadmap is also the ability to circumvent two-factor authentication.SOVA already has one highly uncommon banking-trojan feature that stands out for Android malware, according to the analysis: The ability to steal session cookies, which allows the malware to piggyback on valid logged-in banking sessions, thus skirting the need to have banking credentials to access victim\u2019s accounts.\u201cCookies are a vital part of web functionality, which allow users to maintain open sessions on their browsers without having to re-input their credentials repeatedly,\u201d researchers noted. \u201cSOVA will create a WebView to open a legitimate web URL for the target application and steal the cookies once the victim successfully logs in\u2026it is capable of stealing session cookies from major websites like Gmail or PayPal with ease.\u201dIn the newer version of SOVA, the cybercrooks also added the option to create a list of applications for which to monitor for cookies automatically.Another feature that version 2 offers is clipboard manipulation, i.e., the ability to alter the data in the system clipboard in an effort to steal cryptocurrency, ThreatFabric explained.\u201cThe bot sets up an event listener, designed to notify the malware whenever some new data is saved in the clipboard,\u201d researchers said. \u201cIf the string of data is potentially a cryptocurrency wallet address, S.O.V.A. substitutes it with a valid address for the corresponding cryptocurrency.\u201dThe supported cryptocurrencies so far are Binance, Bitcoin, Ethereum and TRON.Still ahead on the roadmap, SOVA\u2019s authors said that they will soon add \u201cautomatic three-stage overlay injections.\u201d\u201cIt is not clear what the three stages imply, but it could mean more advances and realistic process, maybe implying download of additional software to the device,\u201d researchers noted.SOVA: A Well-Thought-Out Development RoadmapThe authors of the malware clearly have plenty of ambitions regarding SOVA\u2019s future, and it does have the potential to become a dangerous threat for the Android ecosystem, researchers concluded.\u201cThe second set of features, added in the future developments, are very advanced and would push SOVA into a different realm for Android banking malware,\u201d they said. \u201cIf the authors adhere to the roadmap, it will also be able to feature\u2026DDoS capabilities, ransomware and advanced overlay attacks. These features would make SOVA the most feature-rich Android malware on the market and could become the \u2018new norm\u2019 for Android banking trojans targeting financial institutions.\u201dIn some ways, SOVA could be following in the footsteps of TrickBot, a multiplatform malware that began life as a banking trojan before moving on to other types of cyberattacks and becoming one of the most popular and pervasive trojans used by bad actors across the globe. It now specializes in acting as a first-stage infection, delivering a range of follow-on ransomware and other malware.Interestingly, TrickBot\u2019s authors lately instituted some code changes that could indicate that TrickBot is getting back into the bank-fraud game \u2013 specifically adding a man-in-the-browser (MitB) capability for stealing online banking credentials that derives from Zeus, the early banking trojan \u2014 potentially signaling a coming onslaught of fraud attacks.It\u2019s time to evolve threat hunting into a pursuit of adversaries.\u00a0JOIN\u00a0Threatpost and Cybersixgill for\u00a0Threat Hunting to Catch Adversaries, Not Just Stop Attacks\u00a0and get a guided tour of the dark web and learn how to track threat actors before their next attack.\u00a0REGISTER NOW\u00a0for the LIVE discussion on Sept. 22 at 2 p.m. EST with Cybersixgill\u2019s Sumukh Tendulkar and Edan Cohen, along with independent researcher and vCISO Chris Roberts and Threatpost host Becky Bracken.MalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The TrickBot trojan is adding man-in-the-browser (MitB) capabilities for stealing online banking credentials that resemble Zeus, the early banking trojan, researchers said \u2014 potentially signaling a coming onslaught of fraud attacks.TrickBot is a sophisticated (and common) modular threat known for stealing credentials and delivering a range of follow-on ransomware and other malware. But it started out as a pure-play banking trojan, harvesting online banking credentials by redirecting unsuspecting users to malicious copycat websites.According to researchers at Kryptos Logic Threat Intelligence, this functionality is carried out by TrickBot\u2019s webinject module. When victim attempts to visit a target URL (like a banking site), the TrickBot webinject package performs either a static or dynamic web injection to achieve its goal, as researchers explained:\u201cThe static inject type causes the victim to be redirected to an attacker-controlled replica of the intended destination site, where credentials can then be harvested,\u201d they said, in a Thursday posting. \u201cThe dynamic inject type transparently forwards the server response to the TrickBot command-and-control server (C2), where the source is then modified to contain malicious components before being returned to the victim as though it came from the legitimate site.\u201dIn the updated version of the module, TrickBot has added support for \u201cZeus-style webinject configs,\u201d according to Kryptos Logic \u2013 an additional way to dynamically inject malicious code into target banking-site destinations.Tapping Zeus for a Thunderbolt of MitBZeus was once the ascendent banking trojan on the crimeware scene until 2011, when its source code was leaked. Multiple malwares have since cherrypicked various of its functionalities to incorporate into their own code, researchers explained.\u201cDue to Zeus having been the gold standard for banking malware, Zeus-style webinjects are extremely popular,\u201d they said. \u201cIt is not uncommon for other malware families to support Zeus-style webinject syntax for cross-compatibility (4Zloader, 5Citadel, to name a few).\u201dIn a Zeus approach, the injection is accomplished by proxying traffic through a local SOCKS server \u2013 a trick that\u2019s also found in IcedID\u2019s man-in-the-browser webinject module, researchers said. When a victim attempts to visit a target URL (one of the many hardcoded into the module), the traffic flowing through the listening proxy is dynamically modified accordingly.Researchers explained that to accomplish this, it creates a self-signed TLS certificate and adds it to the certificate store.\u201cThe module contains a packed payload that is injected into the victim\u2019s browser, where it hooks socket APIs to redirect traffic to a locally listening SOCKS proxy, it also hooks \u2018CertVerifyCertificateChainPolicy\u2019 and \u2018CertGetCertificateChain\u2019 to ensure no certificate errors are shown to the victim,\u201d according to the posting.The updated module is being pushed out to real victims under the name injectDll, which has replaced the old functionality. There are 32-bit and 64-bit versions, the firm found.TrickBot Resumes Bank-Fraud Operations?Kryptos Logic researchers explained that the development is notable given that TrickBot has evolved from its banking-trojan days to focus almost exclusively on acting as a first-stage, multipurpose malware that is often the precursor to a ransomware infection. It\u2019s also often seen performing lateral propagation throughout a network environment, before delivering a final payload (again, usually ransomware). Recently it even added a bootkit function.So, this new effort in freshening up the webinject module may indicate that TrickBot\u2019s operators are getting back into the banking-fraud fray, researchers said.\u201cThe resumption of development of the webinject module indicates that TrickBot intends to revive its bank-fraud operation, which appears to have been shelved for over a year,\u201d Kryptos Logic researchers concluded. \u201cThe addition of Zeus-style webinjects may suggest expansion of their malware-as-a-service platform, enabling users to bring their own webinjects.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have seen a new variant of the IcedID banking trojan sliding in via two new spam campaigns.Written in English and carrying .ZIP files full of the malware \u2013 or links to such ZIP files \u2013 the new twist on the old banking trojan is a tweaked downloader, which the threat actors moved from the initial x86 version to the latest: an x86-64 version. They also ditched the fake command-and-control (C2s) servers that were found in the earlier configuration and which were likely there to complicate malware analysis, researchers said.In an advisory posted on Thursday, Kaspersky researchers said that they spied the new spam campaigns \u2013 both of which were designed to deliver banking trojans \u2013 in mid-March. Most of the payloads the researchers collected were IcedID (Trojan-Banker.Win32.IcedID), but they also came across a few samples of the Qbot banking trojan (Backdoor.Win32.Qbot, aka QakBot).The primarily IcedID-flavored campaigns were coming in at a fever pitch: Campaign spikes hit more than 100 detections a day.That\u2019s in keeping with another widespread IcedID email campaign that pelleted targets in April, when rigged Microsoft Excel attachments and Excel 4 macros were dumping IcedID at high volumes. At the time, it looked like the IcedID trojan was stepping in to fill the void left by Emotet after the malware got slapped offline in January; besides being a banking trojan, IcedID is increasingly used as a dropper for other malware.IcedID (a.k.a. BokBot) is similar to Emotet in that it\u2019s a modular malware that started life as a banking trojan, initially used to steal financial information. As Kaspersky researchers noted, IcedID can also detect virtual machines (VMs), which comes in handy when malware authors want to slip past VMs that execute potentially malicious binaries in order to suss out their behavior.IcedID can also pull off other malicious actions, such as web injects: Powerful, malicious tools built into banking trojans that enable a threat actor to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) and compromise a user\u2019s bank account.Researchers also explained that for its part, the Qbot banking trojan is a single executable with an embedded DLL that\u2019s capable of downloading and running additional modules that carry out malicious activities, such as web injects, email collection and password grabbing.Variant Picks Up a Slippery New DownloaderBesides the spike in infection attempts, the IcedID variant has also been outfitted with a new downloader.As the researchers tell it, IcedID has two parts, a downloader and a main body. The downloader sends user information \u2013 for example, username, MAC address and Windows version \u2013 to the C2 server and, in turn, receives the main body of the malware.In previous IcedID versions, the downloader was compiled as an x86 executable. Also, after previous IcedID versions were configured, post-decryption, they turned out to contain fake C2 addresses, presumably \u201cto complicate analysis of the samples,\u201d Kaspersky researchers hypothesized. In the new version, as mentioned, the threat actors moved from x86 to an x86-64 version and did away with the fake C2s in the configuration.As well, the authors of the latest IcedID variant tweaked the malware\u2019s main body. The main body has previously been distributed as a shellcode hidden in a .PNG image. \u201cThe downloader gets the image, decrypts the main body in the memory and executes it,\u201d the researchers detailed. \u201cThe main body maps itself into the memory and starts to perform its malicious actions such as web injects, data exfiltration to the C2, download and execution of additional payloads, exfiltration of system information and more,\u201d they said.It\u2019s still distributed as a .PNG image, and it retains the same decryption and C2 communication methods. But this time, the authors decided not to use shellcode. Instead, according to Kaspersky\u2019s advisory, IcedID\u2019s main body is now distributed as \u201ca standard [PE, or Portable Executable] file with some loader-related data in the beginning.\u201dThe researchers noted that, instead of IcedID\u2019s two parts, Qbot is a single executable with an embedded DLL in the main body that\u2019s stored in the resource PE section.To do its dirty work, Qbot calls in its dirty minions: \u201cIn order to perform traffic interception, steal passwords, perform web injects and take remote control of the infected system, it downloads additional modules: Web inject module, hVNC (remote control module), email collector, password grabber and others,\u201d according to the advisory.Downloader with old configuration. Source: Kaspersky.Configuration of new downloader. Source: Kaspersky.Infection No. 1: DotDatThe researchers called the first campaign \u201cDotDat.\u201d They said that it was doling out .ZIP attachments that purported to be some sort of cancelled operation or compensation claims with the names in the format [document type (optional)]-[some digits]-[date in MMDDYYYY format]. \u201cWe assume the dates correspond with the campaign spikes,\u201d they said in the advisory. The .ZIP archives contained a boobytrapped Excel file with the same name.The Excel file downloads a malicious payload via a macro from a URL with the format [host]/[digits].[digits].dat and then executes the payload. The URL is generated during execution using the Excel function \u201cNOW()\u201d, according to the researchers. It delivers a payload that\u2019s either the IcedID downloader \u2013 Trojan.Win32.Ligooc \u2013 or Qbot packed with a polymorph packer: A tool that rolls up several kinds of malware into a single package, such as an e-mail attachment, and which can mutate its signature over time, making it that much more difficult to detect and remove.The Excel file contains obfuscated Excel 4.0 macro formulas to download and execute either payload. The macro generates a payload URL and calls the WinAPI function \u201cURLDownloadToFile\u201d to download the malware.Macro downloads IcedID downloader. Source: Kaspersky.After the macro successfully fetches the downloader, the payload is launched using the \u201cEXEC\u201d function and Windows Rundll32 executable.Macro starts payload. Source: Kaspersky.Infection No. 2: \u2018summer.gif\u2019In the second campaign researchers tracked, the spam emails contained links to hacked websites with malicious archives named \u201cdocuments.zip\u201d, \u201cdocument-XX.zip\u201d and\u201ddoc-XX.zip\u201d, where XX stands for two random digits. Similar to the DotDat campaign, the archives contained an Excel file with a macro that downloaded the IcedID downloader. According to Kaspersky\u2019s data, this spam campaign peaked on March 17. By April, the malicious activity \u201chad faded away,\u201d researchers said.Also like the first spam campaign, the \u201csummer.gif\u201d campaign used Excel 4.0 macro formulas and the URLDownloadToFile function. The main difference in the downloader is that the URL is stored in a cell inside the malicious file, researchers said.This campaign gets its name from a file referred to by the URL \u2013 \u201csummer.gif\u201d \u2013 but the payload is in actuality an executable, not a .GIF image. According to the advisory, to execute the payload, the macro uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) tools and regsvr32 \u2013 a command-line utility in Microsoft Windows and ReactOS for registering and unregistering DLLs and ActiveX controls in the operating system Registry.\u201csummer.gif\u201d payload download.

In March, telemetry indicated that the greatest number of users attacked by Ligooc, the IcedID downloader, were observed in China (16 percent), followed by India (12 percent), Italy (11 percent), the U.S. (11 percent) and Germany (9 percent).During that same month, Qbot was also most active in China (11 percent), as well as India (11 percent), France (8 percent), Russia (8 percent) and the U.S. (5 percent).Join Threatpost for \u201cTips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting\u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered an Android trojan that can steal victims\u2019 SMS messages and credentials and completely take over devices. The trojan, dubbed TeaBot, is aimed at committing fraud against at least 60 banks in Europe.Join Threatpost for \u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d a LIVE roundtable event on Wednesday, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT for this FREE webinar sponsored by Zoho ManageEngine.Once installed on a victim\u2019s device, attackers can use the trojan to obtain a live streaming of the device screen on demand and also interact with it via Accessibility Services, according to a report posted online by online fraud-management firm Cleafy about the trojan, which is also tracked by the name \u201cAnatsa.\u201dResearchers from Cleafy\u2019s Threat Intelligence and Incident Response (TIR) team detected TeaBot\u2014which shares a number of features with other Android trojans\u2013for the first time March 29 against banks in Italy, but the malware has since spread with \u201cinjections against Belgium and Netherlands banks,\u201d according to the report.However, once digging deeper into the sample they examined, researchers found evidence that TeaBot targeted banks in Spain as early as January and also targeted German banks in March, they said. In total, researchers have extracted scenarios against a predefined list of more than 60 banks.Work in ProgressAt the moment, the trojan supports six different languages\u2014Spanish, English, Italian, German, French and Dutch\u2014and appears to be in its early stages of development because of some of the glitches observed in its process flow, researchers noted.\u201cThe partial network encryption and the presence of some not-working injections and commands (or in some cases a lack of injections for specific targeted banks) suggest to us that the TeaBot is still under development,\u201d they wrote.Like other Android trojans that use Accessibility Services to do their dirty work, TeaBot also can abuse this feature to perform a number of functions on someone\u2019s device. These capabilities include performing Overlay Attacks against multiple banking applications to steal login credentials and credit card information, something it shares with modern banking trojans such as Anubis and Cerberus/Alien, researchers said.TeaBot also can send, intercept or hide SMS messages; enable key-logging functionalities; steal Google Authentications codes; and use Accessibility Services and real-time screen sharing to obtain full remote control of an Android device, according to researchers.\u201cWe assume that TeaBot, similar to Oscorp, is trying to achieve a real-time interaction with the compromised device combined with the abuse of Android Accessibility Services bypassing the need of a \u2018new device enrollment\u2019 to perform an Account Takeover scenario,\u201d researchers wrote in the report.Indeed, banking trojans often rely on how \u201crelatively easily intercepted\u201d user credentials and SMS messages are once a device becomes infected, allowing them ready access to banking apps, noted David Stewart, CEO of security firm Approov. This should inspire enterprises to \u201cadd further checks on the apps and their runtime environment before accepting API transactions requests,\u201d he said in an e-mail to Threatpost.Prominent FeaturesWhile TeaBot shares features with other trojans, it relies more heavily on some rather than others, researchers observed. One of the main activities of the trojan is keylogging, through which \u201cTeaBot is able to observe and track all the information performed by the user on the targeted applications,\u201d researchers said.While this behavior is similar to another Android banking trojan EventBot, TeaBot behaves differently in that it tracks only targeted apps, not all apps, like EventBot does, researchers noted. This means less traffic is generated between the banker and the command and control server, calling less attention to the nefarious activity.TeaBot also has a unique feature to take continuous screenshots of a victim\u2019s device to constantly monitor the screen of the compromised device in a loop, researchers noted.While TeaBot appears to be localized \u201cwithin certain European countries for the time being,\u201d banks operating in the rest of the world should also be put on notice, as \u201csuch attacks can quickly spread regionally and across the globe,\u201d observed one security expert.\u201cAs compromised login credentials can be used in conjunction with biographic information that is easy to socially engineer these days, a mobile only problem can quickly spread cross channel across online and traditional contact center channels and overwhelm the bank\u2019s fraud team,\u201d Rajiv Pimplaskar, chief research officer for security firm Veridium, said in an email to Threatpost.Join Threatpost for\u00a0\u201cFortifying Your Business Against Ransomware, DDoS & Cryptojacking Attacks\u201d \u2013 a LIVE roundtable event on\u00a0Wed, May 12 at 2:00 PM EDT.

        "raw text": "The banking trojan known as IcedID appears to be taking the place of the recently disrupted Emotet trojan, according to researchers.IcedID (a.k.a. BokBot), bears similarities to Emotet in that it\u2019s a modular malware that started life as a banking trojan used to steal financial information. Increasingly though, it\u2019s being used as a dropper for other malware, researchers noted \u2013 also just like Emotet.The malware has been circulating at increasing rates, thanks to a spate of email campaigns using Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file attachments, according to Ashwin Vamshi and Abhijit Mohanta, researchers with Uptycs.In fact, in the first three months of the year, Uptyc\u2019s telemetry flagged more than 15,000 HTTP requests from more than 4,000 malicious documents, the majority of which (93 percent) were Microsoft Excel spreadsheets using the extensions .XLS or .XLSM.If opened, targets would be asked to \u201cenable content\u201d to view the message. Enabling the content allows embedded Excel 4 macro formulas to execute.\u201c.XLSM supports the embedding of Excel 4.0 macro formulas used in Excel spreadsheet cells,\u201d according to an analysis published on Wednesday. \u201cAttackers leverage this functionality to embed arbitrary commands, which usually download a malicious payload from the URL using the formulas in the document.\u201d The URLs generally belong to legitimate but compromised websites, they added.Looking deeper into the activity, they were able to see similarities between all of the attacks, suggesting a coordinated campaign. For instance, the documents were all given vanilla business-related names, such as \u201coverdue,\u201d \u201cclaim\u201d or \u201ccomplaint and compensation claim,\u201d along with a random series of numbers. And, the HTTP requests all delivered a second-stage executable file (either an .EXE or .DLL file), obfuscated with a fake extension \u2014 either .DAT, .GIF or .JPG.In reality, the files were either the IcedID or QakBot malware families.From an evasion-detection perspective, the macros also all used three techniques to stay hidden: \u201cUpon investigation, we identified three interesting techniques used to hinder analysis,\u201d the researchers noted. \u201cHiding macro formulas in three different sheets; masking the macro formula using a white font on white background; and shrinking the cell contents and making the original content invisible.\u201dWill IcedID Replace Emotet?Emotet, which up until its disruption in January was packaged into an average of 100,000 to a half-million emails sent per day \u2013 that prompted Europol to call it the \u201cworld\u2019s most dangerous malware.\u201dEmotet is often used as a first-stage loader, tasked with retrieving and installing secondary malware payloads, including Qakbot, the Ryuk ransomware and TrickBot. Its operators often rent its infrastructure to other cybercriinals in a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model. However,\u201cOperation LadyBird,\u201d a global takedown effort at the beginning of the year, disrupted hundreds of botnet servers supporting Emotet and eliminated active infections on more than 1 million endpoints worldwide. The malware hasn\u2019t really seen a resurgence since then, leaving a void in the cybercrime market when it comes to initial access options.The volume of circulating IcedID samples led Uptycs researchers to believe that it\u2019s a likely candidate to\u00a0 become the new Emotet.\u201cBased on this increasing trend, we believe that IcedID will emerge as an incarnation of Emotet after its disruption,\u201d Vamshi and Mohanta noted. \u201cIcedID has also been recently reported to deploy ransomware operations, moving towards a MaaS model to distribute malware.\u201dThe good news is that companies have options to protect themselves against these well-known trojans.\u201cIcedID, Emotet, and many other malware strains share a few elements that make it easier to stop them from affecting an infrastructure,\u201d Dirk Schrader, global vice president of security research at New Net Technologies, told Threatpost. \u201cThey might be sophisticated in the way they hide in an office document, however, that is only the first step of the infection chain. IcedID is not different from others as it also attempts to download \u2013 to drop \u2013 additional components. For these first two steps, monitoring system integrity is key, control changes happening on any device.\u201dEver wonder what goes on in underground cybercrime forums?

        "raw text": "The Metamorfo banking trojan is abusing AutoHotKey (AHK) and the AHK compiler to evade detection and steal users\u2019 information, researchers have warned.AHK is a scripting language for Windows originally developed to create keyboard shortcuts (i.e., hot keys).According to the Cofense Phishing Defense Center (PDC), the malware (a.k.a. Mekotio) is targeting Spanish-language users using two separate emails as an initial infection vector. One is a purported request to download a password-protected file; and the other is an elaborate spoofed notification about pending legal documents, with a link that downloads a .ZIP file.Metamorfo Abusing AHKIn both cases, the malicious code is contained in a .ZIP file that\u2019s ultimately downloaded to victim computers. It contains three files: the legitimate AHK compiler executable (.EXE), a malicious AHK script (.AHK) and the banking trojan itself (.DLL). These are unpacked into a randomly named file housed in C:\\\\ProgramData.A script will then run the AHK compiler, the AHK compiler will execute the AHK script, and the AHK script will finally load Metamorfo into the AHK compiler memory.\u201c[Metamorfo] will then operate from within the AHK compiler process, using the signed binary as a front to make detection more difficult for endpoint solutions,\u201d researchers explained, in a posting on Thursday.For persistence, copies of all three files are also placed in a new folder.\u201cIt will then use a run key to initiate the execution chain every time the system restarts by executing the renamed copy of the AHK compiler,\u201d according to the report.Metamorfo Resurgence in LatAm, EuropeMetamorfo started life as a Latin American banking trojan, first discovered in April 2018, in various campaigns that share key commonalities (like the use of \u201cspray-and-pray\u201d spam tactics). Its campaigns however have small, \u201cmorphing\u201d differences \u2014 which is the meaning behind its name.A variant that emerged in February 2020, for instance, kills the auto-suggest data entry fields in browsers, forcing victims to write out their passwords \u2013 which it then tracks via a keylogger.That trick is also present in the latest attacks, according to the PDC, with cybercrooks targeting customers of banks in Latin America and Europe (including France, Portugal and Spain).Metamorfo monitors browser activity looking for targeted banks, which are listed in the form of strings in the AHK compiler process memory, researchers explained. When a victim opens one of the targeted banking pages, Metamorfo overlays it with a fake version of the webpage designed to harvest credentials.\u201c[Metamorfo] disables specific registry browser values associated with password and form suggestions and autocompletion,\u201d researchers said. \u201cThis forces the user to type in sensitive information, even if they have it saved in their browser history, allowing the malware to capture credentials with its keylogging capabilities.\u201dThis version of the trojan can also monitor Bitcoin addresses copied to a clipboard and replace them with one belonging to the attackers.\u201cAs of this writing, this specific attacker address had a balance of 0.01957271 BTC, approximately $800,\u201d researchers said.Metamorfo\u2019s Banking Trojan Infection RoutineThe PDC encountered two main mechanisms for delivering the payload in these campaigns.In the first instance, there is a .ZIP file containing an MSI file that includes a malicious domain harboring 32 and 64-bit versions of a second .ZIP file; and in the second scenario the original .ZIP file drops a shortcut file containing a malicious Finger command. Finger.exe is a native Windows command that allows the retrieval of information about a remote user.\u201cThe Custom Actions table of these MSI files enables the incorporation of custom code to the installation package and is often abused by attackers,\u201d said the researchers. \u201c[The table] shows an action titled \u2018dqidwlCTIewiuap\u2019 containing obfuscated JavaScript. The JavaScript is responsible for downloading the correct version of the .ZIP file from the payload site, unzipping its contents, renaming and placing it into a new randomly named folder.\u201dIn the second instance, a command is used to contact a server, which displays the contents of a hosted file in a command shell. The file in question is a PowerShell script that will run in this shell.\u201cThe script carries out similar actions to the MSI: it downloads a ZIP file, renames it, copies it to a newly created folder and unzips it there,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cThe PDC also saw both tactics combined in at least one case, by incorporating the malicious Finger command directly into the MSI Custom Actions table.\u201dUsers can protect themselves by being wary of what files they download and also by checking their machines for random new file folders in the Windows Program Data directory.\u201cThe main takeaway is that legitimate binaries can be leveraged as a fa\u00e7ade for malicious activity,\u201d researchers concluded. \u201cVigilance is key. If a file or process is not meant to be there, it\u2019s best to check.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live webinar events\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community:March 24:\u00a0Economics of 0-Day Disclosures: The Good, Bad and Ugly (Learn more and register!)April 21:\u00a0Underground Markets: A Tour of the Dark Economy (Learn more and register!)MalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have identified new versions of the Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT) that target the Windows anti-malware interface used by security vendors to protect PCs from attacks. The newly discovered variants have also adopted new obfuscation capabilities, raising the stakes for businesses to fend off the ever-evolving Agent Tesla malware.Chief among the update is that the malware now targets Microsoft\u2019s anti-malware software interface (ASMI) in order to avoid detection. ASMI allows applications and services to integrate with any antimalware product that\u2019s present on a machine. The malware also now has the added capability of deploying a Tor client to conceal its communications, as well as using the Telegram chat application to exfiltrate data.All of these changes\u00a0make both sandbox and static analysis and endpoint detection of the malware more difficult, warned researchers.\u201cAgent Tesla remains a consistent threat\u2014for many months, it has remained among the top families of malware in malicious attachments caught by Sophos,\u201d said Sophos researchers on Tuesday. \u201cBecause of this sustained stream of Agent Tesla attacks, we believe that the malware will continue to be updated and modified by its developers to evade endpoint and email protection tools.\u201dAgent Tesla first came into the scene in 2014, specializing in keylogging (designed to record keystrokes made by a user in order to exfiltrate data like credentials and more) and data-stealing. Agent Tesla has historically arrived in a malicious spam email as an attachment.The first stage of the malware\u2019s newer version includes a .NET-based downloader. The downloader collects obfuscated code from websites like Pastebin and Hastebin (which touts itself as an \u201copen source alternative to Pastebin\u201d). \u00a0This is not a new tactic, with Agent Tesla previously turning to a legitimate Pastebin-like web service for downloading malware.Credit: SophosThen, Agent Tesla\u2019s installer attempts to overwrite code in Microsoft\u2019s AMSI. First, the downloader attempts to get the memory address of AmsiScanBuffer (Microsoft\u2019s function, also known as amsi.h, that scans a buffer-full of content for malware).It does so by calling Windows\u2019 amsi.dll, using the Windows LoadLibraryA function, to get the DLL\u2019s base address. Then it uses the GetProcAddress function to retrieve the base address and the \u201cAmsiScanBuffer\u201d procedure name to get the address of the function.Once Agent Tesla gets the address of AmsiScanBuffer, it patches the first 8 bytes of the function in memory. This forces AMSI to return an error (code 0x80070057), making all the AMSI scans of memory appear to be invalid, according to researchers.\u201cThis kneecaps AMSI-enabled endpoint protection software, by essentially making them skip further AMSI scans for dynamically loaded assemblies within the Agent Tesla process,\u201d said researchers. \u201cSince this happens early in the first stage downloader\u2019s execution, it renders any AMSI protection against the subsequent components of the downloader, the second-stage loader, and the Agent Tesla payload itself.\u201dThe new version of Agent Tesla also has the added capabilities of deploying a Tor client. This\u00a0free, open-source software enables anonymous communication \u2013 serving as a tool for Agent Tesla to conceal its communications, said researchers.\u201cIf selected in the configuration file, the malware downloads and installs a Tor client from the official Tor site,\u201d said researchers. If the Tor client is already present, it kills the process before installing the new one, and writes a torrc configuration file from encrypted strings hardcoded into the malware.\u201dNew FeaturesResearchers said the functionality of these two new variants is widely the same, but now include updates to the data that is captured, and how it is exfiltrated.In the new Agent Telsa version, the developers can now capture data from the Windows clipboard. The Windows clipboard is a storage area for items the have been cut or copied; this data could include anything from sensitive copied data from emails or documents, to passwords. This data is then sent back to the command-and-control (C2) server.Another difference is that in the new version of Agent Tesla, the number of applications targeted for credential harvesting \u201chas been expanded considerably.\u201dAgent Tesla previously targeted credentials from applications like Apple Safari, Chromium, Google Chrome, Iridium, Microsoft IE and Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, OpenVPN, Opera, Opera Mail, Qualcomm Eudora, Tencent QQBrowser and Yandex. The malware also now targets FTPNavigator ( Windows-based Internet application that facilitates FTP transfer), WinVNC4 (a remote desktop control allowing users to control computers remotely), WinSCP (which provides\u00a0secure file transfer between a local and a remote computer) and SmartFTP ( network file transfer program for Microsoft).\u201cThe credential-stealing function also includes code which launches a separate thread to exfiltrate browser cookies. While this code is present in all the samples of Agent Tesla from both v2 and v3, it isn\u2019t always used,\u201d said researchers.\u00a0 \u201cAlso, this feature is not set from the configuration file\u2014so, perhaps, it\u2019s a premium feature attackers must buy from Agent Tesla\u2019s developer.\u201dWhile Agent Tesla has previously communicated with the C2 server over HTTP, SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) and FTP (file transfer protocol), the new version also uses Telegram to exfiltrate data, by sending the stolen data to a private Telegram chat room.Agent Tesla: A Seven-Year ThreatWhile the Windows-targeting Agent Tesla remote access trojan (RAT) has been active for over seven years, researchers said that they have continued to see new variants of the malware in a growing number of attacks over the past 10 month, compared to the infamous\u00a0TrickBot\u00a0or\u00a0Emotet malware, for instance.In fact, in December 2020, Agent Tesla account for 20 percent of malware email attachments detected in researchers\u2019 telemetry.Moving forward, researchers said they believe Agent Tesla will continue to evolve.\u201cThe differences between the two demonstrate how the RAT has evolved, employing multiple types of defense evasion and obfuscation to avoid detection,\u201d they said.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World, sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a new information-stealing trojan, which targets Microsoft Windows systems with an onslaught of data-exfiltration capabilities\u2013 from collecting browser credentials to targeting Outlook files.The trojan, called PyMicropsia (due to it being built with Python) has been developed by threat group AridViper, researchers said, which is known for targeting organizations in the Middle East.\u201cAridViper is an active threat group that continues developing new tools as part of their arsenal,\u201d researchers with Palo Alto\u2019s Unit42 research team said in a Monday analysis. \u201cAlso, based on different aspects of PyMicropsia that we analyzed, several sections of the malware are still not used, indicating that it is likely a malware family under active development by this actor.\u201dClick to register.The trojan\u2019s information-stealing capabilities include file uploading, payload downloading/execution, browser-credential stealing (and the ability to clear browsing history and profiles), taking screenshots and keylogging. In addition, the malware can collect file listing information, delete files, reboot machines, collect information from USB drive and record audio; as well as harvest Outlook .OST files and kill/ disable Outlook processes.An OST file, also known as an Offline Outlook Data File, is used by Microsoft accounts, Exchange accounts and Outlook.com accounts \u201cto store a synchronized copy of your mailbox information on your local computer,\u201d according to Microsoft.\u00a0OST files may contain email messages, contacts, tasks, calendar data and other account information.The TrojanThe trojan has been made into a Windows executable by PyInstaller, a Python package allowing applications into stand-alone executables.\u00a0Once downloaded, the malware \u201cimplements its main functionality by running a loop, where it initializes different threads and calls several tasks periodically with the intent of collecting information and interacting with the C2 operator,\u201d according to researchers.The threat actor uses both built-in Python libraries and specific packages for information-stealing purposes \u2013 including PyAudio (enabling audio stealing capabilities) and mss (allowing screenshot capabilities).\u201cThe usage of Python built-in libraries is expected for multiple purposes, such as interacting with Windows processes, Windows registry, networking, file system and so on,\u201d said researchers.PyMicropsia has relations to the Micropsia malware family, another AridViper malware known for targeting Microsoft Windows . These links include code overlaps; similar tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), such as the use of rar.exe to compress data for exfiltration; and similar command-and-control (C2) communication URI path structures.Micropsia has also made references to specific themes in code and C2 implementations \u2013 including previous references to TV shows like The Big Bang Theory and Game of Thrones. Of note, in PyMicropsia\u2019s code variables, researchers found references to multiple famous actor names, actors Fran Drescher and Keanu Reeves, which \u201cseems in line with previous observations of themes,\u201d said researchers.AridViper: Active DevelopmentWhile investigating PyMicropsia\u2019s capabilities, researchers said they also identified two additional samples hosted in the attacker\u2019s infrastructure.The additional samples, which are downloaded and used by the trojan during its deployment, provide persistence and keylogging capabilities. They are not Python/ PyInstaller based.While PyMicropsia is designed to target Windows operating systems only, researchers found snippets in the code that check for other operating systems (such as \u201cposix\u201d or \u201cdarwin\u201d). Posix, or the Portable Operating System Interface, is a family of standards used for maintaining compatibility between operating systems; and Darwin an open-source Unix-like operating system.\u201cThis is an interesting finding, as we have not witnessed AridViper targeting these operating systems before and this could represent a new area the actor is starting to explore,\u201d they said. \u201cFor now, the code found is very simple, and could be part of a copy and paste effort when building the Python code, but in any case, we plan to keep it on our radar while researching new activity.\u201dThis article was updated on Oct. 15 at 2pm ET to reflect a more accurate description of OST files.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows, Israel Barak, CISO at Cybereason and Limor Kessem, Executive Security Advisor at IBM Security\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

        "raw text": "A wave of targeted cyberattack campaigns bent on espionage is cresting around the globe, using a strain of a 13-year old backdoor trojan named Bandook.According to Check Point Research, Bandook was last spotted being used in 2015 and 2017/2018, in the \u201cOperation Manul\u201d and \u201cDark Caracal\u201d campaigns, respectively. The malware then all but disappeared from the threat landscape \u2013 but it\u2019s now having a resurgence.According to the firm, dozens of digitally signed variants of this commodity malware are popping up in an unusually large variety of sectors and locations. Targeted entities include those in the government, financial, energy, food industry, healthcare, education, IT and legal sectors. And, they have been located in Chile, Cyprus, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Singapore, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.S.\u201cThis further reinforces a previous hypothesis that the malware is not developed in-house and used by a single entity, but is part of an offensive infrastructure sold by a third party to governments and threat actors worldwide, to facilitate offensive cyber-operations,\u201d according to researchers at Check Point, in a recent posting.Fresh Wave of AttacksIn these latest attacks, the malware arrives on targets\u2019 computers in the form of a malicious Microsoft Word document delivered inside a .zip file. Check Point found that the themes of the documents revolve around cloud-based services like Office365, OneDrive and Azure \u2013 recipients are promised access to other documents if they click \u201cEnable Content.\u201d\u201cFor example, one of the documents that specifically got our attention depicts an Office365 logo and a preview of a certificate issued by the government of Dubai,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cJAFZA \u2013 Jebel Ali Free Zone, featured at the top of the document, is an industrial area surrounding the port of Jebel Ali in Dubai, where more than 7,000 global companies are based.\u201dOnce the document is opened, malicious macros download using the external template feature. An external template is downloaded via a URL shortening web service like TinyURL or Bitly, which redirects to another domain controlled by the attacker; the template itself is invisible to the victim.The macros in turn load a second-stage payload: A PowerShell script encrypted inside the original Word document.\u201cThe external template document contains a VBA code that runs automatically, decrypts the embedded data from the original lure document, and drops the decoded data into two files in the local user folder: fmx.ps1 (the next-stage PowerShell) and sdmc.jpg (base64 encoded PowerShell code),\u201d explained Check Point researchers. \u201cTo allow this behavior, the attackers use a combination of two techniques: Encrypted data is embedded inside a shape object within the original document (hidden from view by a small font size and white foreground), and is accessed from the external template code.\u201dIn each attack, after a certain amount of time, the attacker switches the malicious external template to a benign one, making the analysis of the infection chain more difficult, Check Point researchers noted.First, the decoded PowerShell script downloads a .zip file containing four files from a cloud service such as Dropbox, Bitbucket or an S3 bucket, Check Point researchers explained. This is stored in the user\u2019s Public folder, and the four files are locally extracted.\u201cThree of the files, a.png, b.png and untitled.png, are used by the PowerShell script to generate the malware payload in the same folder. Untitled.png, unlike the other two files, is in a valid image format,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cIt contains a hidden RC4 function encoded in the RGB values of the pixels, created using a known tool named invoke-PSImage.\u201dFinally, the PowerShell script executes the malware, opens draft.docx, and deletes all previous artifacts from the Public folder. Draft.docx is a benign document whose sole purpose is to convince the victim that nothing is amiss.Finally, the PowerShell script downloads and executes the last stage of the infection, which is the Bandook backdoor itself.BandookBandook is a fully featured RAT, written in both Delphi and C++, which was created in 2007 by a Lebanese individual nicknamed PrinceAli, according to Check Point. Over time, several variants of the malware builder were leaked to the web, and the malware became publicly available for download.Bandook\u2019s execution flow starts with a loader, written in Delphi, that uses process-hollowing to create an instance of an Internet Explorer process and then inject a malicious payload into it. The payload contacts the command-and-control server (C2), sends basic information about the infected machine, and waits for additional commands.This particular variant of the Bandook malware however is not one of the ones whose builder was leaked to the web. While earlier versions supported a range of more than 100 commands, the new variant only supports 11, researchers said. These include taking screenshots, downloading and uploading files, executing Python and Java payloads and more.Also, the communication protocol used with the C2 was also upgraded to use AES encryption (a feature not available in the public Bandook leaks), and valid Certum certificates were used to sign the Bandook malware executable.In addition to the recent Bandook samples, Check Point also identified additional samples from 2019 to 2020 that were not digitally signed and contained about 120 commands.\u201cSeveral factors led us to believe that these signed and unsigned variants are specially crafted Bandook variants, used and developed by the same entity,\u201d according to the report. \u201cBoth use the same domain registration services for their C2 domains: Porkbun or NameSilo; they share a similar method of communication, using the AES encryption algorithm in CFB mode, with a hardcoded IV: 0123456789123456\u2026.[and] they incorporated commands that we did not observe in any other public leak or report.\u201dIt\u2019s likely, according to Check Point, that the threat actors behind the malicious infrastructure used in Operation Manul and Dark Caracal are still operational, \u201cwilling to assist in the offensive cyber operations to anyone who is willing to pay.\u201dResearchers noted, \u201cAlthough not as capable, nor as practiced in operational security like some other offensive security companies, the group behind the infrastructure in these attacks seems to improve over time, adding several layers of security, valid certificates and other techniques, to hinder detection and analysis of its operations.\u201dPut Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.

        "raw text": "A newly uncovered banking trojan called Alien is invading Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials.Once it has infected a device, the RAT aims to steal passwords from at least 226 mobile applications \u2013 including banking apps like Bank of America Mobile Banking and Capital One Mobile, as well as a slew of collaboration and social apps like Snapchat, Telegram and Microsoft Outlook.The malware, which was first advertised for rent on underground forums in January, has been used to actively target institutions worldwide, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, the U.K. and the United States. Researchers believe Alien is a \u201cfork\u201d of the infamous Cerberus banking malware, which has undergone a steady demise in use over the past year.\u201cBased on our in-depth knowledge of the trojan, we can prove that the Alien malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early January 2020 and rented out at the same time as Cerberus,\u201d said researchers with ThreatFabric, in a Thursday analysis. \u201cCerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS [malware as a service] for fraudsters.\u201dAlien MalwareThe Alien RAT has various commonly used Android malware capabilities, including the ability to launch overlay attacks, control and steal SMS messages and harvest contact lists \u2013 as well as keylogging, location-collecting and other capabilities.However, it also touts several more advanced techniques, including a notification sniffer that allows it to access all new updates on infected devices. This includes 2FA codes \u2013 allowing the malware to bypass 2FA security measures.Alien leverages this tactic by abusing the \u201candroid.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE\u201d to get the content of status bar notifications on the infected device. While normally the user would need to grant this permission manually in the settings, the malware circumvents this roadblock by using the Accessibility privileges on Android devices, performing all necessary user interactions by itself.Countries targeted by Alien malware. Click to enlarge. Credit: ThreatFabricIt does this using an advanced remote access feature that abuses the TeamViewer application, giving the bad actor behind the malware remote control over the victim\u2019s devices. TeamViewer is a\u00a0proprietary software application used for remote control, desktop sharing and online meetings.\u201cWhen TeamViewer is successfully activated, it provides the actors with full remote control of the device\u2019s user interface, enabling them to access and change device settings, install and remove apps, but also to use any app installed on the device (bank applications, messengers and social networks),\u201d said researchers. \u201cBy monitoring the device in real-time, actors can also gain valuable insight into the user\u2019s behavior.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how Alien is initially spread, but given that the malware is being rented out, many different initial attack vector tactics can be used, including spear-phishing, distribution through third-party applications and more.Link to CerberusCerberus meanwhile\u00a0first emerged last August\u00a0on underground forums, offered in a MaaS rental model. At the time it was presented as a standard banking trojan. As recently as July, the malware was uncovered in a malicious Android app on the Google Play app marketplace, which had 10,000 downloads.However, over the past year a slew of technical issues occurred that led to unhappy customers. The authors of Cerberus consequently decided to end the rental service and refund active license holders. On August 10, the malware author shared the source code of the trojan to the general public.The decline of Cerberus in 2020. Credit: ThreatFabricMeanwhile, researchers said that in February they started seeing simultaneous campaigns using both trojans \u2013 however, it appeared that the new Alien malware was operated separately and was slightly different from Cerberus.The biggest difference between the two samples is Alien\u2019s 2FA-stealing technique, a feature that Cerberus lacked, they said. Another distinctive feature of Alien is its RAT capability, which has been implemented separately from the main command handler, using different command-and-control (C2) endpoints.\u201cLooking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own,\u201d researchers said.Next StepsResearchers point to this link between Cerberus and Alien as a trend in the threat landscape to continue to look out for. They predicted that more new malware families, based on Cerberus, will emerge in the last quarter of 2020. When it comes to Alien specifically, looking ahead, researchers said that they expect the malware\u2019s authors to continually improve its remote-access functionality.\u201cThey could also build an ATS [automatic transfer system] feature to automate the fraud process,\u201d said researchers. \u201cWhat can be considered for granted is that the number of new banking trojans will only continue growing, many embedding new and improved features to increase the success rate of fraud.\u201dResearchers urge all financial institutions to understand their current and future threat exposure and consequently implement the relevant detection and control mechanisms.\u201cThe most important aspect to take care of is securing the online banking channels, making fraud hard to perform, discouraging criminals to attempt the attacks and making it less useful for them to build more malware,\u201d they wrote.HacksMalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "Attacks attributed to the Qbot trojan, known as the \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d of malware, are on the uptick with a reported 100,000 recent infections, according to researchers.Qbot, an ever-evolving information-stealing trojan that\u2019s been around since 2008, has shifted tactics again and adopted a bevy of new techniques, according to researchers at Check Point who released a report on their findings Thursday. For example, one new Qbot feature hijacks a victim\u2019s Outlook-based email thread and uses it to infect other PCs.The 12-year-old malware resurface in January 2020, according to F5 researchers, who issued a report in June detailing new Qbot evasive features to avoid detection.\u201cWe assumed that the campaign was stopped [after June] to allow those behind QBot to conduct further malware development, but we did not imagine that it would return so quickly,\u201d wrote Alex Ilgayev, the Check Point researcher behind the report.Ilgayev now says Check Point has identified several fresh campaigns in recent months. One of those campaigns hitched a ride with the Emotet botnet, which\u00a0also recently resurfaced after a five-month hiatus. This they said signals a new distribution technique. That single campaign impacted 5 percent of organizations globally in July, Check Point said. Researchers also suspect that Qbot has a renewed command-and-control infrastructure.\u201cOur research shows how even older forms of malware can be updated with new features to make them a dangerous and persistent threat,\u201d Yaniv Balmas, head of cyber research at Check Point said in an email to Threatpost. \u201cThe threat actors behind Qbot are investing heavily in its development to enable data theft on a massive scale from organizations and individuals.\u201dSo far, most of the victims of the new Qbot campaigns have been in the United States, where 29 percent of Qbot attacks have been detected, followed by India, Israel and Italy, according to Check Point.Perhaps most troubling about the recent manifestation of Qbot is how it turns people\u2019s own inboxes against them. Once installed, the trojan sends specially crafted emails to the target organizations or individuals, each with a URL to a ZIP with a malicious Visual Basic Script (VBS) file, which contains code that can be executed within Windows, researchers said.If the file is executed, Qbot then activates a special \u201cemail collector module\u201d to extract all email threads from the victim\u2019s Outlook client, which it then uploads to a hardcoded remote server.\u201cThese stolen emails are then utilized for future malspam campaigns, making it easier for users to be tricked into clicking on infected attachments because the spam email appears to continue an existing legitimate email conversation,\u201d researchers wrote.The trojan picks off threads with timely and relevant subject material to try to fool victims; in the recent campaigns, Check Point researchers observed Qbot stealing emails related to Covid-19, tax-payment reminders and job recruitments.Once it\u2019s unleashed, Qbot boasts a number of capabilities, any of which would be problematic for victims on its own, researchers observed.The malware can steal information from infected machines, including passwords, emails and credit card details, they said. It also can install malware, including ransomware, on other machines, or connect to a victim\u2019s computer using the Bot controller to make bank transactions from that IP address, according to Check Point.In addition to the usual email security protections, Check Point is advising people to be especially vigilante with any email that appears to be suspicious or remotely phish-y\u2013even if the sender is someone they know\u2013to avoid falling victim to the revamped Qbot, Balmas said.\u201cI strongly recommend people to watch their emails closely for signs that indicate a phishing attempt\u2013even when the email appears to come from a trusted source,\u201d he said.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET: Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.

        "raw text": "Threat actors have enhanced a banking trojan that has been widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic with new functionality to help it avoid detection by potential victims and standard security protections.Attackers have implemented several new features \u2014 including a password-protected attachment, keyword obfuscation and minimalist macro code\u2014in a recent phishing campaign using documents trojanized by the widely used banking trojan IcedID, according to a new report by Juniper Networks security researcher Paul Kimayong.The campaign, which researchers discovered in July, also uses a dynamic link library (DLL) \u2014 a Microsoft library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time \u2014 as its second-stage downloader. This \u201cshows\u201d a new maturity level of this threat actor,\u201d he observed.The latest version of IcedID identified by the Juniper team is being distributed using compromised business accounts where the recipients are customers of the same businesses. This boosts the likelihood of the campaign\u2019s success, as the sender and the recipient already have an established business relationship, Kimayong noted.Researchers at IBM first discovered IcedID back in 2017 as a trojan targeting banks, payment card providers, mobile services providers, payroll, web mail and e-commerce sites.The malware has evolved over the years and already has a history of clever obfuscation. For instance, it resurfaced during the COVID-19 campaign with new functionality that uses steganography, or the practice of hiding code within images to stealthily infect victims, as well as other enhancements.Kimayong\u2019s report details an example of the new IcedID campaign and its evasive tactics from a compromise of PrepNow.com, a private, nationwide student tutoring company that operates in a number of U.S. states.Attackers sent phishing emails, which claim to include an invoice, to potential victims. They purported to be from the accounting department, with a password-protected ZIP file attached. This password protection allows the file to evade anti-malware solutions, he noted. The password is included in the email body for victims to find and use to open the file.The campaign is novel in how it obfuscates the word \u201cattached\u201d in a number of ways in the email, Kimayong wrote. It seems unlikely attackers would do this to try to bypass spam filters or phishing-detection, since the presence of an attachment is obvious, he noted.\u201cIf anything, we expected the obfuscation to obfuscate the word \u2018password\u2019 because that\u2019s a tell-tale sign of something phishy going on,\u201d Kimayong wrote. \u201cThen again, modifying the body of the email ever so slightly may change some fuzzy hashes email security solutions calculate to identify bulk email campaigns.\u201dThe campaign also included a curious behavior in that it rotates the file name used for the attachment inside the ZIP file, which seems a \u201cfutile\u201d attempt to evade security protections, \u201csince the password protection should prevent most security solutions from opening and inspecting the content,\u201d he observed.No matter, the email was not blocked by Google\u2019s Gmail security, which seems to prove that the evasion tactics worked, according to the report.If victims open the attachment, the campaign then launches a three-stage attack to unleash the IcedID trojan, Kimayong wrote.The expanded ZIP file a Microsoft Word document that contains a macro that executes upon opening the document, with \u201cthe usual social-engineering attempt to get victims to enable macros,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnce macros are enabled, the VB script will download a DLL, save it as a PDF and install it as a service using regsvr32 to guarantee persistence.\u201dThis stage also shows how attackers are being \u201cminimalist\u201d in their use of macro code, which \u201cis very simple and straightforward\u201d even though it still manages to obfuscate strings and function calls to evade detection, Kimayong wrote.The attack\u2019s second stage downloads the DLL from 3wuk8wv[.]com or 185.43.4[.]241, a site that is hosted on a\u00a0hosting provider in Siberia in Russia. Once downloaded, the malicious DLL is saved as a PDF file, and then the macro executes it via a call to regsvr32.exe, according to the report.The DLL downloads the next stage of the attack from the domain loadhnichar[.]co as a PNG file and decrypts it, Kimayong wrote. This stage of the attack also has evasive tactics, he noted.\u201cThis loader blends its traffic with requests to benign domains, such as apple.com, twitter.com, microsoft.com, etc. to look more benign to sandboxes trying to analyze it,\u201d Kimayong wrote.The third stage ultimately downloads the IcedID main module as a PNG file, spawns a msiexec.exe process and injects the IcedID main module into it, he said.\u00a0It\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

        "raw text": "A malicious Android app has been uncovered on the Google Play app marketplace that is distributing the banking trojan, Cerberus. The app has 10,000 downloads.Researchers said that the trojan was found within the last few days, as it was being spread via a Spanish currency converter app (called \u201cCalculadora de Moneda\u201d), which has been available to Android users in Spain since March. Once executed, the malware has the capabilities to steal victims\u2019 bank-account credentials and bypass security measures, including two-factor authentication (2FA).\u201cAs is common with banking malware, Cerberus disguised itself as a genuine app in order to access the banking details of unsuspecting users,\u201d Ondrej David, with Avast, said in a Tuesday analysis. \u201cWhat\u2019s not so common is that a banking trojan managed to sneak onto the Google Play Store.\u201dTo avoid initial detection, the app hid its malicious intentions for the first few weeks while being available on Google Play. During this time, the app acted normally as a legitimate converter, and it not steal any data or cause any harm, David said.\u201cThis was possibly to stealthily acquire users before starting any malicious activities, which could have grabbed the attention of malware researchers or Google\u2019s Play Protect team,\u201d\u00a0 according to David.In mid-June, newer versions of the currency converter included what researchers called a \u201cdropper code,\u201d but it still wasn\u2019t activated. Then, on July 1, the app deployed a second stage where it became a dropper, silently downloading the malware onto devices without the victims\u2019 knowledge. The app was connected to a command-and-control server (C2), which issued a new command to download the additional malicious Android Application Package (APK), Cerberus.Cerberus has various spying and credential-theft functionalities. It can sit over an existing banking app and wait for the user to log into their bank account. Then, it creates a layover over the victims\u2019 login screen, and steals their banking credentials. In addition, the trojan has the ability to access victims\u2019 text messages, meaning that it can view two-factor authentication (2FA) codes sent via message.\u201cIt uses Android\u2019s accessibility function, as well as the overlay attack mechanism, which is typical for banking trojans, so when a user opens their regular banking app, an overlay screen is created, and the user\u2019s login details collected,\u201d David told Threatpost.Researchers said that the C2 server and payload associated with the campaign were active up until Monday of this week. Then, on Monday evening, the C2 server disappeared and the currency converter on Google Play no longer contained the trojan malware.Avast has notified Google about the malicious app; Threatpost has reached out to Google for further comment on whether the app is still available on Google Play.\u201cThe version in Google Play currently does not contain the dropper code anymore \u2013 the app was updated with a new version, which is benign again,\u201d David told Threatpost. \u201cWe can only speculate why the threat actors are doing this. It could be they are testing different options with this app, including whether and when Google or external cybersecurity researchers detect the malicious code. So far, we have not received a response from Google yet.\u201dThe Evolving Cerberus ThreatCerberus\u00a0first emerged last August\u00a0on underground forums, being offered in a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model.\u00a0Since then a newly discovered variant of the Cerberus Android trojan has been spotted, with vastly expanded and more sophisticated info-harvesting capabilities, and the ability to run TeamViewer.It\u2019s only the latest malware family to be discovered on a legitimate app marketplace. In February, researchers identified eight malicious Android apps on Google Play distributing the \u201cHaken\u201d malware, which exfiltrates sensitive data from victims and covertly signs them up for expensive premium subscription services. And in April, a new spyware campaign dubbed PhantomLance was discovered being distributed via dozens of apps within Google Play.David said that Android users can protect themselves by paying attention to the permissions an app requests and checking an app\u2019s user ratings. \u201cIf you feel that the app is requesting more than it promises to deliver, treat this as a red flag,\u201d he said.BEC and enterprise email fraud is surging, but DMARC can help \u2013 if it\u2019s done right.

        "raw text": "Qbot, an ever-evolving information-stealing trojan that\u2019s been around since 2008, has reappeared after a hiatus to target customers of U.S. financial institutions. Its latest variant features fresh capabilities to help it remain undetected.Qbot (a.k.a. Qakbot or Pinkslipbot) harvests browsing data and financial info, including online banking details. Some of its tricks include keylogging, credential theft, cookie exfiltration and process hooking. Qbot has previously evolved to add a \u201ccontext-aware\u201d delivery technique; and in another case added a six-hour evolution cycle to evade detection.Researchers at F5 have uncovered recent activity using a new variant that also strives hard to avoid analysis. The first samples of the new strain first emerged in January in Virus Total, they told Threatpost.\u201cQbot is still Windows-based, but this latest version adds both detection- and research-evasion techniques,\u201d according to the latest F5 analysis. \u201cIt has a new packing layer that scrambles and hides the code from scanners and signature-based tools. It also includes anti-virtual machine techniques, which helps it resist forensic examination.\u201dIn the latest campaign, attackers are infecting computers via phishing, web exploits that inject Qbot via a dropper, or via malicious file shares. According to F5, once the victim is compromised, Qbot bides its time until a victim opens a web page that it\u2019s interested in \u2013 specifically, online banking portals for Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, Citizen\u2019s Bank, J.P. Morgan, Sun Bank, TD Bank, Wells Fargo and others.\u201cThis appears to be a dedicated campaign with a browser hijack, or redirection, as the main attack method when the machine is infected,\u201d researchers explained. \u201cAs Qbot watches a victim\u2019s web traffic, it looks for specific financial services from which to harvest credentials.\u201dIn all, this wave of infections is specifically targeting 36 U.S. financial institutions and two banks in Canada and the Netherlands, according to the firm. The researchers told Threatpost that the scope of the activity in terms of numbers of victims is not known.Interestingly, Qbot targets pages with regular-expression search strings that query \u201clogout/exit/quit\u201d requests, F5 researchers told Threatpost: \u201cThis is unique, and allows an attacker to trigger the attack after the user requested to log out of the legitimate activity.\u201dQbot\u2019s target list also includes generic URLs that might be used in a second stage in an attack \u2013 say, for surfacing a message to victims in order to redirect them elsewhere once the banking activity is concluded.\u201cSince the generic URL\u2019s are regular expression they can be used in different ways, for example https://*/cmserver/logout.cfm* ,\u201d researchers told Threatpost. \u201cIt will not limit the attack but would rather extend that to any site requesting it, since it is a \u2018logout.\u2019 It could be in second stage of the attack when the user wants to log out and suddenly an additional message appears.\u201dUnpacking RoutineOnce a victim has been initially compromised, the Qbot executable loads itself into the running explorer.exe memory. It then copies itself into the application folder\u2019s default location, as defined in the %APPDATA% registry key, and creates a copy of itself in the specific registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to run when the system reboots in order to achieve persistence.In the next step, according to the F5 analysis, Qbot drops a .dat file with a log of the system information and the botnet name, then executes its copy from the %APPDATA% folder. After that, to cover its tracks, it replaces the originally infected file with a legitimate one.\u201cLastly, Qbot creates an instance of explorer.exe and injects itself into it,\u201d F5 researchers said. \u201cThe attackers then use the always-running explorer.exe process to update Qbot from their external command-and-control server.\u201dThe latest version of Qbot shows that long-time malware can still be dangerous, researchers said.\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that malware from over 10 years ago is still active and recoded for new attacks,\u201d James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, said via email. \u201cCybercriminals have seen it work successfully in the past and update the code and concepts by injecting it into known processes, which are accepted by anti-malware applications.\u201dHe added that as always, user awareness can go a long way to thwarting attacks like this.\u201cEmployees in the organization should be aware that visiting unfamiliar or unknown websites can deliver side-channel attacks and bypass the security of their system,\u201d McQuiggan said. \u201cThey should be mindful of how to alert their security teams in the event of strange behaviors, especially social engineering scams, like phishing.\u201dInsider threats are different in the work-from home era.

        "raw text": "After a recent dip, ransomware attacks are back on the rise. According to data released by NCC Group, the resurgence is being led by old ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) groups.With data gathered by \u201cactively monitoring the leak sites used by each ransomware group and scraping victim details as they are released,\u201d researchers have determined that Lockbit was by far the most prolific ransomware gang in July, behind 62 attacks. That\u2019s ten more than the month prior, and more than twice as many as the second and third most prolific groups combined. \u201cLockbit 3.0 maintain their foothold as the most threatening ransomware group,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cand one with which all organizations should aim to be aware of.\u201dThose second and third most prolific groups are Hiveleaks \u2013 27 attacks \u2013 and BlackBasta \u2013 24 attacks. These figures represent rapid rises for each group \u2013 since June, a 440 percent rise for Hiveleaks, and a 50 percent rise for BlackBasta.It may well be that the resurgence in ransomware attacks, and the rise of these two particular groups, are intimately connected.Why Ransomware Has BouncedResearchers from NCC Group counted 198 successful ransomware campaigns in July \u2013 up 47 percent from June. Sharp as that incline may be, it still falls some ways short of the high-water mark set this Spring, with nearly 300 such campaigns in both March and April.Why the Flux?Well, in May, the United States government ramped up its efforts against Russian cybercrime by offering up to $15 million for prized information about Conti, then the world\u2019s foremost ransomware gang. \u201cIt is likely that the threat actors that were undergoing structural changes,\u201d the authors of the report speculated, \u201cand have begun settling into their new modes of operating, resulting in their total compromises increasing in conjunction.\u201dHiveleaks and BlackBasta are the result of that restructuring. Both groups are \u201cassociated with Conti,\u201d the authors noted, Hiveleaks as an affiliate and BlackBasta as a replacement strain. \u201cAs such, it appears that it has not taken long for Conti\u2019s presence to filter back into the threat landscape, albeit under a new identity.\u201dNow that Conti\u2019s properly split in two, the authors speculated, \u201cit would not be surprising to see these figures further increase as we move into August.\u201dMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Microsoft researchers have linked an emerging ransomware threat that already has compromised a number of small-to-mid-sized businesses to financially motivated North Korean state-sponsored actors that have been active since last year.A group tracked by researchers from Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) as DEV-0530 but that calls itself H0lyGh0st has been developing and using ransomware in attacks since June 2021.The group has successfully compromised small-to-mid-sized businesses\u2014including manufacturing organizations, banks, schools, and event and meeting planning companies\u2014in multiple countries starting as early as September, researchers from MTIC and Microsoft Digital Security Unit (MDSU) said in a blog post published Thursday.H0lyGh0st\u2019s standard modus operandi is to use a namesake ransomware to encrypt all files on the target device using the file extension .h0lyenc, then send the victim a sample of the files as proof. The group interacts with victims on a .onion site that it maintains and on which it provides a contact form for victims to get in touch, researchers said.[FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office. WATCH HERE.]The group typically demands payment in Bitcoin in exchange for restoring access to the files. On its website, H0lyGh0st claims that it won\u2019t sell or publish victim data if they pay, researchers said. However, it uses double extortion to pressure targets to pay, threatening to publish stolen data on social media or send it to the victims\u2019 customers if they don\u2019t meet ransom demands.Introducing H0lyGh0stH0lyGh0st\u2019s ransomware campaigns are financially motivated, with researchers observing text linked to a ransom note that they intercepted in which attackers claim they aim to \u201cclose the gap between the rich and poor,\u201d researchers said.\u201cThey also attempt to legitimize their actions by claiming to increase the victim\u2019s security awareness by letting the victims know more about their security posture,\u201d they said.DEV-0530 also has connections with another North Korean-based group tracked as PLUTONIUM, also known as DarkSeoul or Andariel, according to MSTIC, with researchers observing communications between the two groups. H0lyGh0st also has been seen using tools created exclusively by PLUTONIUM, they said.A Tale of Two FamiliesSince it began using ransomware in June 2021 and until May 2022, H0lyGh0st has employed two custom-developed malware families\u2013SiennaPurple and SiennaBlue, researchers said. MSTIC identified four variants linked to these families: BTLC_C.exe, HolyRS.exe, HolyLock.exe, and BLTC.exe.BTLC_C.exe is written in C++ and is classified as SiennaPurple, while the rest are written in the open-source Go programming language, researchers said. All of the variants are compiled into .exe to target Windows systems, they said.BLTC_C.exe is a portable ransomware developed by the group that was first seen in June 2021. However, it may have been an early version of the group\u2019s development efforts, as it doesn\u2019t have many features compared to all malware variants in the SiennaBlue family, researchers said.Later in the group\u2019s evolution, between October 2021 and May 2022, MSTIC observed a cluster of new DEV-0530 ransomware variants written in Go, which they classify as SiennaBlue variants, they said.Though new Go functions have been added to the various variants over time, all the ransomware in the SiennaBlue family share the same core Go functions, researchers observed. These features include various encryption options, string obfuscation, public key management, and support for the internet and intranet, researchers said.Most Recent VariantThe latest ransomware variant to be used by the group is BTLC.exe, which researchers have seen in the wild since April of this year, they said.BTLC.exe can be configured to connect to a network share using the default username, password, and intranet URL hardcoded in the malware if the ServerBaseURL is not accessible from the device, researchers said.The malware also includes a persistence mechanism in which it creates or deletes a scheduled task called lockertask that can launch the ransomware. Once the malware is successfully launched as an administrator, it tries to connect to the default ServerBaseURL hardcoded in the malware, attempts to upload a public key to the C2 server, and encrypts all files in the victim\u2019s drive, they said.FREE On-demand Event: Join Keeper Security\u2019s Zane Bond in a Threatpost roundtable and learn how to securely access your machines from anywhere and share sensitive documents from your home office.

        "raw text": "Several federal agencies are warning healthcare organizations that they are under threat of attacks from North Korean state-sponsored actors employing a unique ransomware that targets files with surgical precision, according to U.S. federal authorities.Threat actors from North Korea have been using Maui ransomware since at least May 2021 to target organizations in the healthcare and public health sector, according to a joint advisory issued Wednesday by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).Organizations should be on the lookout for indicators of compromise and take mitigations against such attacks, both of which are included in the federal advisory.Moreover, if organizations do find themselves the victim of attack, the agencies recommend that they refrain from paying any requested ransom, \u201cas doing so does not guarantee files and records will be recovered and may pose sanctions risks,\u201d they wrote in the advisory.Unique RansomwareMaui\u2013which has been active since at least April 2021, according to a report on the ransomware by cybersecurity firm Stairwell\u2013 has some unique characteristics that set it apart from other ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) threats currently in play.\u201cMaui stood out to us because of a lack of several key features we commonly see with tooling from RaaS providers,\u201d Silas Cutler, principal reverse engineer at Stairwell, wrote in the report.These include the lack of a ransom note to provide recovery instructions or automated means of transmitting encryption keys to attackers, he wrote.The former characteristic adds an especially sinister quality to Maui attacks, observed one security professional.\u201cCyber criminals want to get paid quickly and effectively, and with little information for the victim the attack is increasingly malicious in nature,\u201d observed James McQuiggan, security awareness advocate at security firm KnowBe4, in an e-mail to Threatpost.Surgical PrecisionAnother characteristic of Maui that diverges from other ransomware is that it appears to be designed for manual execution by a threat actor, allowing its operators to \u201cspecify which files to encrypt when executing it and then exfiltrate the resulting runtime artifacts,\u201d Cutler wrote.This manual execution is a trend that\u2019s increasing among advanced malware operators, as it allows attackers to target only the most important assets on a network, noted one security professional.\u201cFor truly organizational crippling ransomware attacks, threat actors need to manually identify the important assets and the weak points to truly take down a victim,\u201d observed John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, a security and operations analytics SaaS firm, in an email to Threatpost. \u201cAutomated tools simply cannot identify all the unique aspects of each organization to enable a complete takedown.\u201dSingling out specific files to encrypt also gives attackers more control over an attack while also making it slightly less taxing for a victim to clean up after, noted Tim McGuffin, director of adversarial Eegineering at information security consulting firm LARES Consulting.\u201cBy targeting specific files, the attackers get to choose what is sensitive and what to exfiltrate in a much more tactical fashion when compared to a \u2018spray-and-pray\u2019 ransomware,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can show \u2018good faith\u2019 from the ransomware group by allowing targeting and recovery of just sensitive files and not having to rebuild the entire server if [for example] the operating system files are encrypted as well.\u201dHealthcare Under FireThe healthcare industry has been the target of increased attacks, particularly over the last two and a half years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, there are a number of reasons the sector continues to be an attractive target for threat actors, experts said.One is because it\u2019s a financially lucrative industry that also tends to have outdated IT systems without sophisticated security. This makes healthcare organizations low-hanging fruit for cybercriminals, noted one security professional.\u201cHealthcare is always targeted due to their multi-million dollar operating budget and U.S. Federal guidelines that make it difficult to quickly update systems,\u201d KnowBe4\u2019s McQuiggan observed.Moreover, attacks on healthcare agencies can put people\u2019s health and even their lives at risk, which might make organizations in the sector more likely to pay ransoms to criminals straightaway, experts observed.\u201cThe need to restore operations as quickly as possible can drive healthcare organizations to more readily and swiftly pay any extortion demands stemming from ransomware,\u201d noted Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at cybersecurity company Cerberus Sentinel, in an email to Threatpost.Because cybercriminals know this, the FBI, CISA and Treasury said the sector can continue to expect attacks from North Korean state-sponsored actors.Healthcare information also is highly valuable to threat actors due to its sensitive and private nature, making easy to resell on cybercriminal marketplaces as well as useful to construct \u201chighly tailored secondary social engineering attack campaigns,\u201d Clements observed.Sequence of AttackCiting the Stairwell report, federal agencies provided a breakdown of how an attack by Maui ransomware\u2014installed as an encryption binary called \u201cmaui.exe\u201d\u2013encrypts specific files on an organization\u2019s system.Using a command-line interface, threat actors interact with the ransomware to identify which files to encrypt, using a combination of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), RSA and XOR encryption.First Maui encrypts target files with AES 128-bit encryption, assigning each file a unique AES key. A custom header contained in each file that includes the file\u2019s original path allows Maui to identify previously encrypted files. The header also contains encrypted copies of the AES key, researchers said.Maui encrypts each AES key with RSA encryption and loads the RSA public (maui.key) and private (maui.evd) keys in the same directory as itself. It then encodes the RSA public key (maui.key) using XOR encryption with an XOR key that\u2019s generated from hard drive information.During encryption, Maui creates a temporary file for each file it encrypts using GetTempFileNameW(), and uses this file to stage output from encryption, researchers said. After encrypting files, Maui creates maui.log, which contains output from Maui execution and is likely to be exfiltrated by threat actors and decrypted using associated decryption tools.Register Now for this LIVE EVENT on MONDAY JULY 11: Join Threatpost and Intel Security\u2019s Tom Garrison in a live conversation about innovation enabling stakeholders to stay ahead of a dynamic threat landscape and what Intel Security learned from their latest study in partnership with Ponemon Institue.

        "raw text": "Ransomware groups are abusing unpatched versions of a Linux-based Mitel VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) application and using it as a springboard plant malware on targeted systems. The critical remote code execution (RCE) flaw, tracked as CVE-2022-29499, was first report by Crowdstrike in April as a zero-day vulnerability and is now patched.Mitel is popularly known for providing business phone systems and unified communication as a service (UCaaS) to all forms of organizations. The Mitel focuses on VoIP technology allowing users to make phone calls using an internet connection instead of regular telephone lines.According to Crowdstrike, the vulnerability affects the Mitel MiVoice appliances SA 100, SA 400 and Virtual SA. The MiVoice provides a simple interface to bring all communications and tools together.Bug Exploited to Plant Ransomware \u00a0Researcher at Crowdstrike recently investigated a suspected ransomware attack. The team of researchers handled the intrusion quickly, but believe the involvement of the vulnerability (CVE-2022-29499) in the ransomware strike.The Crowdstrike identifies the origin of malicious activity linked to an IP address associated with a Linux-based Mitel VoIP appliance. Further analysis led to the discovery of a novel remote code exploit.\u201cThe device was taken offline and imaged for further analysis, leading to the discovery of a novel remote code execution exploit used by the threat actor to gain initial access to the environment,\u201d Patrick Bennet wrote in a blog post.The exploit involves two GET requests. The first one targets a \u201cget_url\u201d parameter of a PHP file and the second one originates from the device itself.\u201cThis first request was necessary because the actual vulnerable URL was restricted from receiving requests from external IP addresses,\u201d the researcher explained.The second request executes the command injection by performing an HTTP GET request to the attacker-controlled infrastructure and runs the stored command on the attacker\u2019s server.According to the researchers, the adversary uses the flaw to create an SSL-enabled reverse shell via the \u201cmkfifo\u201d command and \u201copenssl_client\u201d to send outbound requests from the compromised network. The \u201cmkfifo\u201d command is used to create a special file specified by the file parameter and can be opened by multiple processes for reading or writing purposes.Once the reverse shell was established, the attacker created a web shell named \u201cpdf_import.php\u201d. The original content of the web shell was not recovered but the researchers identifies a log file that includes a POST request to the same IP address that the exploit originated from. The adversary also downloaded a tunneling tool called \u201cChisel\u201d onto VoIP appliances to pivot further into the network without getting detected.The Crowdstrike also identifies anti-forensic techniques performed by the threat actors to conceal the activity.\u201cAlthough the threat actor deleted all files from the VoIP device\u2019s filesystem, CrowdStrike was able to recover forensic data from the device. This included the initial undocumented exploit used to compromise the device, the tools subsequently downloaded by the threat actor to the device, and even evidence of specific anti-forensic measures taken by the threat actor,\u201d said Bennett.Mitel released a security advisory on April 19, 2022, for MiVoice Connect versions 19.2 SP3 and earlier. While no official patch has been released yet.Vulnerable Mitel Devices on ShodanThe security researcher Kevin Beaumont shared a string \u201chttp.html_hash:-1971546278\u201d to search for vulnerable Mitel devices on the Shodan search engine in a Twitter thread.According to Kevin, there are approximately 21,000 publicly accessible Mitel appliances worldwide, the majority of which are located in the United States, succeeded by the United Kingdom.Mitel Mitigation Recommendations\u00a0Crowdstrike recommends that organizations tighten defense mechanisms by performing threat modeling and identifying malicious activity. The researcher also advised segregating the critical assets and perimeter devices to restrict the access control in case perimeter devices are compromised.\u201cTimely patching is critical to protect perimeter devices. However, when threat actors exploit an undocumented vulnerability, timely patching becomes irrelevant,\u201d Bennett explained.MalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "In the last two years, COVID-19 has occupied healthcare providers\u2019 minds \u2014 rightfully so, considering the pandemic\u2019s tremendous toll on patients. But another threat that causes immense harm gets less attention: ransomware. While ransomware attacks receive lots of headlines, the irreparable damage that this threat could cause patients is often missing from the discussion.Cyberattacks are a different kind of a pandemic that\u2019s substantially increased over the last several years. They have become an everyday reality for the healthcare sector. Healthcare leaders understand cyber threats are a \u201cnew normal.\u201d But the cyber-risk conversation typically centers on the bottom line, such as the costs of mitigation, noncompliance, or lawsuits.For a sector whose mission is to improve our quality of life, it\u2019s surprising that the top cybersecurity concerns revolve around financial losses. Healthcare leaders, physicians, and other care providers need to look at cybersecurity risks through a new lens \u2014 patient health and safety.Ransomware and Health Professionals Promise to \u2018Do No Harm\u2019Healthcare professionals devote their attention to protecting patients from harm. In today\u2019s digital world, this mandate is no longer limited to direct-care delivery. A ransomware attack puts patients physically at risk and might be as devastating as a life-threatening disease.Consider the attack that crippled operations at the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMC) in the fall of 2020. After ransomware shuttered access to systems like electronic health records for almost a month, UVMC\u2019s cancer center had to turn away hundreds of chemotherapy patients.The cancer clinic largely served rural areas, so the cyberattack not only left many of those patients with fear, anguish, and tears but also with no treatment alternatives.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0quoted one nurse as saying, \u201cTo look someone in the eye, and tell them they cannot have their life-extending or lifesaving treatment, it was horrible, and totally heart-wrenching.\u201dStories like those of the UVMC patients rarely unravel in public, but they\u2019re far from unique. A recent\u00a0Ponemon Institute report\u00a0(PDF) found that a ransomware attack hit 43% of surveyed healthcare delivery organizations in the past two years. Consequences included poor outcomes because of procedure or test delays (experienced by 70% of hospitals affected by ransomware), increased complications from medical procedures (36%), and a rise in mortality rates (22%).Rethinking the Importance of CybersecurityECRI, a nonprofit focused on patient safety, named cybersecurity attacks the\u00a0top health technology hazard\u00a0(PDF) for 2022. The factors that influenced the ranking included severity, frequency, breadth, and preventability. The ECRI report drove home the point that cybersecurity incidents \u201cdon\u2019t just interfere with business operations \u2014 they can disrupt patient care, posing a real threat of physical harm.\u201dExpect this risk to loom large as threat actors target the sector at an alarming pace. UVMC is a case in point \u2014 just days after\u00a0U.S. government officials warned\u00a0about imminent cyberattacks by Russian hackers on American hospitals, they hit the medical center. It wasn\u2019t the first such alarm.Cybersecurity, of course, is not a fresh problem for the sector. IT and cybersecurity professionals have long sounded the siren that healthcare is behind many other industries in implementing robust defenses. But ransomware threats shine a new light on cybersecurity inadequacies because the impact on patients is immediate, and the harm is much greater than something like a data breach.It\u2019s time for both decision-makers and healthcare delivery professionals to comprehend the human benefits of cybersecurity and the human loss when it is absent or fails. Patients come to hospitals or clinics expecting treatment, often urgent. If the healthcare providers can\u2019t deliver those services because cybercriminals hijacked their systems, they\u2019re violating patient trust, as well as putting lives in danger. Considering the rapid growth of cyberattacks in the sector, life-altering scenarios like those we saw at UVMC will become common.Investing in What MattersCybersecurity is not an easy problem to resolve in any sector, but even more so in healthcare. The complexities of the environment, with connected medical devices, multiple locations, and legacy systems, create many challenges. And it doesn\u2019t help that a typical healthcare organization has a minimal IT budget that is far from adequate for implementing effective cybersecurity solutions.Leaving IT teams with few resources to defend against cyberattacks is no longer an option. While healthcare organizations allocate most of their funding to the delivery of care, they also need to realize that in today\u2019s environment, care delivery relies not only on medical equipment and personnel but also on strong cybersecurity defenses. If cybersecurity is a low priority, the delivery of care will suffer.How can you compel decision-makers to view their responsibility through a new lens? Start by telling them the stories they need to hear. The story about the mother of two who was denied her lifesaving treatment. Or the nurse who compared working at a medical center in the grips of ransomware to working at a burn unit after the Boston Marathon bombing. Or the mother who blames a ransomware attack for the\u00a0death of her baby.These are not scare tactics. They are the kind of messages that help translate cybersecurity risks into human impacts. If that doesn\u2019t compel the board of directors or other decision-makers to make investments into cybersecurity, what will?Ryan Witt is Proofpoint\u2019s Healthcare Cybersecurity Leader.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.InfoSec Insider",

Eighty percent of ransomware victims that paid their attackers were hit a second time by the malware scourge.New ransomware numbers come from a Cybereason\u2019s April ransomware survey of 1,456 cybersecurity professionals. According to the gated report (registration required), victims that were successfully extorted were not only targeted a second time, but frequently data encrypted by criminals later became unusable during the decryption process because of corruption issues.\u201cThe fact that ransomware gangs strike so quickly a second and third time isn\u2019t surprising, because they will try to profit in any possible way,\u201d wrote Bill Keeler, senior director of global public relations at Cybereason, in a written exchange with Threatpost. \u201cWhy not hit the same company, demand a higher ransom, and get paid?\u201d\u00a0The report confirms not just the rise in ransomware incidents, something the recent Verizon DBIR documents explicitly, but a worrying new trend.

Here is how:The attackers don\u2019t honor their promise to decrypt and restore the stolen data and downed systems.The data became corrupted during the decryption process.The attackers operate in a nation where paying a ransom by a business is a criminal offense, based on government rules tied to \u201cdoing business\u201d with an identified terrorist entity.Ransom payment encourages the attackers to repeat their success on the same victim.Ransom Payments Lead to Repeat AttacksOf those surveyed by Cybereason, 68 percent said were hit a second time within the very same month as their first attack.\u201cWhen I drill down deeper into the data, it is nearly 50 percent that were hit the second time in 1-7 days,\u201d Keeler wrote.Additionally, 48 percent of organizations that paid a ransom reported having been breached twice by the same attackers. Worse, when a second attack occurred, \u201cthreat actors demanded an even higher ransom amount the second time around,\u201d according to the report.Of those repeat ransomware victims that paid, 44 percent paid again during a separate ransomware incident. Of those that paid twice, 9 percent paid three or more times in separate new attacks.The April Cybereason survey was conducted by Censuswide. Participants represented a global mix of cybersecurity professionals with geographies ranging from the United States (24 percent), U.K. (17 percent), U.A.E., Japan, Singapore and other. A broad mix of industries were represented in the data and ranged from manufacturing (14 percent), finance (10 percent) and other.Malware",

        "raw text": "Ransomware and social engineering continue to dominate challenges facing cybersecurity professionals, according to Verizon\u2019s 15th annual Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR).In general, the results of DBIR merely confirm well-established trends, such as the growing threats of ransomware \u2013 up 13% this year \u2013 and the inescapability of the \u201chuman element\u201d, which was tied to 82% of all breaches.DBIR data is based on 23,896 reported security incidents, including 5,212 verified breaches.Ransomware is Still RisingThe number of ransomware incidents increased this year by nearly 13%, which the analysts noted is \u201can increase as large as the last five years combined.\u201d Ransomware now plays a role in one out of every four breaches.Though the prevalence of ransomware has been rising, the nature of these attacks have remained surprisingly consistent. Verizon first wrote about ransomware in their 2013 report, where they explained how:When targeting companies, typically SMBs, the criminals access victim networks via Microsoft\u2019s Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) either via unpatched vulnerabilities or weak passwords. \u2013 DBIR 2013.Nine years later, the most common vector for ransomware attackers is still desktop sharing software \u2013 used in around 40% of attacks. The overwhelming majority of those instances involve stolen credentials.\u201cHad we known that what was true nine years ago would still be true today,\u201d the researchers concluded, \u201cwe could have saved some time by just copying and pasting some text.\u201dHackers are Targeting UsThere are all kinds of technical mechanisms by which attackers can obtain initial access into a target organization. But they usually don\u2019t need to try all that. The much simpler solution, usually, is to just trick people.According to Verizon, 82% of this year\u2019s data breaches involved the \u201chuman element\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe Use of stolen credentials, Phishing, Misuse, or simply an Error.\u201dPhishing, as expected, is still the hackers\u2019 go-to. Well over 60% of this year\u2019s breaches began that way. Phishers are still using all the same tricks, like pretexting \u2013 inventing a story to convince targets to divulge sensitive information \u2013 leading to business email compromise (27% of all attacks).That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that targets are still so unaware, so naive as to click on any wayward link or smooth-talking email. \u201cOnly 2.9% of employees may actually click on phishing emails,\u201d the researchers noted. It\u2019s just that 2.9% is \u201cmore than enough for criminals to continue to use it\u201d as a method for intrusion.It\u2019s the Same Old StoryWhenever human error arises in cybersecurity discourse, someone\u2019s bound to mention training. But, as the authors of DBIR noted, \u201cMost training takes twice as long to complete than was expected, with 10% taking three times as long.\u201d Additionally, \u201cwhile getting training is easy, proving it\u2019s working is a bit harder.\u201dIt may just be that the cyber threat landscape is in a holding pattern, as it has been for some time now. Every year, it seems, we\u2019re facing the same kinds of attacks, and offering variations of the same solutions that haven\u2019t entirely worked before. John Gunn, CEO of Token, summed it up best in an email to Threatpost:\u201cThe most important research by and for the cybersecurity industry is out, and it feels like the movie Groundhog Day. We are waking up to the same results year after year since the first report in 2008,\u201d Gunn wrote.HacksMalwareWeb Security",

        "raw text": "AUTHOR: Melissa Bischoping is director, endpoint security research specialist at TaniumWhen ransomware strikes, security teams and business leaders are immediately faced with a flurry of questions, including:\u00a0\u201cIs the vulnerability patched?\u201d \u201cDoes my vendor/supplier/customer\u2019s compromise affect me too?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWhat are the implications?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cHow can we prevent this going forward?\u201d This scenario was top of mind for the American Dental Association and its 161,000+ members and associated businesses after it was attacked by the Black Basta ransomware group just last month. Initially, the ADA took multiple systems offline \u2013 a common step in incident response to reduce potential spread while investigations are underway. According to reports, the organization engaged third-party security services as well as law enforcement support and sent emails to members to keep them aware of the emerging situation.Within hours, Black Basta began leaking stolen information which included details on financial forms as well as member data. This attack on the ADA is yet another indicator of an emerging trend among ransomware actors \u2013 creativity. Rather than the typical ransom request for data restoration that has become commonplace, criminals are increasingly expanding their radius.Creative ExploitationRansomware actors are pursuing a concerning trend. They are now taking a multi-faceted approach beyond ransoming the primary victim, which should be a concern for the ADA and its members. Secondhand victims, including dental practices and insurance providers, could be potential targets based on the data obtained in the primary ransomware attack.In May of 2021, Ireland\u2019s public health system, the Health Service Executive, was victimized by a ransomware attack that had significant reverberations.\u201d In the following days and weeks, multiple hospitals connected to the public health service experienced service outages and financial losses, in addition to facing increased risk to patient data safety and access to care.These facts point to a concerning global trend that extends the negative impact of a ransomware attack.It\u2019s clear that threat actors want to maximize the opportunity for payout beyond the initial ransom and potential sale of valuable data. Now, they are using the stolen information and access they\u2019ve gained through the initial exploit to target and extort the victim\u2019s customers, be it individuals or companies. For downstream organizations, one of the first questions when a large organization is breached is, \u201cWill this affect me?\u201d While the primary victim conducts initial response and investigation efforts, potential subsequent victims should focus on prioritizing actions to keep up to date on threat intel and incident response findings, in addition to proactively addressing gaps within their environment.Targets & TechniquesWhen a threat actor identifies additional extortion capabilities or credentials to breach another organization, they may choose to sell this information or leverage it for their own future initiatives. In addition to monitoring for breaches within a supply chain and corporate relationships, organizations should monitor for any data being sold on the Dark Web or released in data breach dumps. Services such as \u201cHaveIBeenPwned\u201d can help alert when your employee credentials are exposed in a breach.Over the last several years, the rise of the once-niche Initial Access Broker market has incentivized the resale of compromised accounts and credentials. These black market vendors are not generally the ransomware operators themselves, but a third party who sells their access to a ransomware gang and thereby accelerates the pace of the ransomware gang\u2019s operations. When a compromise takes place, the opportunity for \u201cpay-for-decrypt\u201d profits, as well as data or credential/access resale, leads to double- or triple-extortion ransomware.Single extortion: Attackers encrypt data to extort payment in exchange for unlocking files (which is often unsuccessful). In the case of single extortion, strong backup practices are the best defense. However, criminals know backups are a common option to avoid payment and will attempt to corrupt backups. This underscores the need for offline backups and \u201cout of band\u201d incident communications, since any system connected during the incident, such as email, most likely can\u2019t be trusted.Double-Extortion: An attacker attempts the \u201cpay-for-decryption scheme,\u201d but also threatens to \u2013 or follows through with \u2013 selling sensitive data/intellectual property on the dark web. Even if pay-for-decryption is avoided, brand reputation can be damaged, and organizations can be subject to fines and penalties. Before data theft can be prevented, it must be understood where data lives. Implementing solutions that allow for near-real-time alerts when sensitive data is saved, transferred, or stored insecurely is the foundation for prevention.Triple-extortion: This combination of single and double occurs when an attacker threatens to DDoS a corporate website or pursues specific customers and threatens to release stolen information unless payment is made. In 2020, this is exactly what occurred in Finland when more than faced requests for several hundred euros each under the threat of sensitive mental health data being released.Diligence & AwarenessThe most important takeaway from this ransomware evolution is that organizations with business connections to a breached organization, such as the ADA in this scenario, should be closely monitoring official update channels, identifying what (if any) of their own data may be at risk, and focus on threat-informed defensive measures.The ADA attack and others like it underscore the importance of being aware of who a company does business with and ensuring that security events with possible downstream impact are being closely monitored.\u00a0 This may include vendors, partners, customers, etc. In today\u2019s interconnected business landscape, there must be a plan for responding to external incidents that may have intended or unintended fallout. This requires preparation, and an understanding of trends in threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).After an attack, educate staff on the risks of phishing and encourage them to report suspicious calls, texts, or e-mails immediately. Even when systems are not directly connected, attackers may use data found in the initial breach to develop social engineering campaigns making downstream companies a target.Additional proactive measures include changing any reused passwords that may be associated with the ADA\u2019s systems and verifying any information or communication received regarding the breach comes from a legitimate source at the ADA rather than compromised emails that may seem official but are fraudulent.Facing the FutureWith the evolution of the strategy and tactics used by ransomware actors, it is essential that organizations have a big-picture perspective for defense, detection, and response and recovery.Early detection of an attacker\u2019s presence and exfiltration attempts requires understanding \u201cnormal\u201d behavior within the environment to establish a baseline to alert against any anomalies so they can be flagged and investigated further.While this baseline approach seems simple, it can be very complex.\u00a0 Achieving this holistic view of your environment requires real-time context and the ability to assess dynamic risk as new devices enter the network, employees on/off-board, and new vulnerabilities emerge. Recovery should go beyond \u201cwipe and reimage\u201d to include thorough checks that can identify residual signs of compromise and, wherever possible, clearly determine initial access points to avoid reintroducing the attack vector during recovery efforts.Enjoy additional insights from Threatpost\u2019s Infosec Insiders community by visiting our\u00a0microsite.Melissa Bischoping is Director, Endpoint Security Research Specialist at Tanium, a converged endpoint management platform company.\u00a0InfoSec Insider",

        "raw text": "For a year now, threat actors have been using different versions of the same ransomware builder \u2013 \u201cChaos\u201d \u2013 to attack governments, corporations and healthcare facilities. Now researchers from Blackberry have connected the dots, painting a picture of a malware that has evolved five times in twelve months.\u201cThe clues surfaced during a discussion between a recent victim and the threat group behind Onyx ransomware, taking place on the threat actor\u2019s leak site,\u201d the researchers noted in a new report. The Onyx ransomware group were threatening to publish said victim\u2019s data to the internet when, in soap opera fashion, a third party entered the chat stating:\u201cHello\u2026 this is my very old version of ransomware\u2026 I updated many thing and it is faster decryptable\u2026 there is no limit in new version\u2026\u201dOnyx was, evidently, just an outdated Chaos build. The proclaimed author of Chaos kindly offered the Onyx group their newest version of Chaos, renamed \u201cYashma.\u201dIn case you\u2019ve already lost track, let\u2019s break it down:Chaos Started as a Scam\u201cThe Chaos author\u2019s apparent intent of \u2018outing\u2019 Onyx as a copycat is particularly ironic,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cgiven the origins of Chaos.\u201dThe first version of Chaos began to make rounds on the dark web in June, 2021. Named \u201cRyuk .Net Ransomware Builder v1.0,\u201d it was marketed as a builder for the famous Ryuk ransomware family. It even sported Ryuk branding on its user interface.Being associated with such a big name yielded attention from reverse-engineers, cybersecurity researchers and cybercriminals alike. But nobody could find any real links between this builder and the real Ryuk ransomware, or the Wizard Spider group behind it. Clearly Ryuk .Net Ransomware Builder v1.0 was a fraud, and \u201cthe response to this ham-handed tactic was so negative,\u201d noted Blackberry\u2019s researchers, that \u201cit prompted the threat\u2019s creator to drop the Ryuk pretense and quickly rebrand its new creation as \u2018Chaos.'\u201dHow Chaos Has EvolvedShortly after its rebrand, the author behind Chaos worked to distinguish their builder. Chaos 2.0 was \u201cmore refined\u201d than its initial version, \u201cgenerating more advanced ransomware samples\u201d that could:Delete shadow copiesDelete backup catalogsDisable Windows recovery modeBut Chaos was still more a destructor than a ransomware, because it lacked any mechanism for file recovery, even if a ransom was paid. That bug was fixed less than a month later, in Chaos version 3.0.The next upgrade, 4.0, was in the wild for months before it gained notoriety in April, 2022, thanks to the ransomware group \u201cOnyx.\u201d Onyx would infiltrate enterprise networks, steal valuable data, then drop their \u201cOnyx ransomware.\u201d This malware was really just a knock-off of Chaos 4.0, though. When Blackberry analyzed samples of both, they found a 98% overlap.\u00a0Malware",

        "raw text": "Ransomware, supply-chain threats and how organizations and their employees are their own worst enemy when it comes to security are some of the key takeaways of Verizon\u2019s annual report on the last 12 months of cyber-attacks.The 2022 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) published Tuesday provided some stark news for organizations aiming to secure themselves against threats that can result in system compromise and the loss of data, resources, money, time and/or all of the above.The researchers behind the report\u2013Gabriel Bassett, C. David Hylender, Philippe Langlois, Alex Pinto and Suzanne Widup\u2013observed that the last few years have been \u201coverwhelming\u201d for everyone, without citing the obvious factors, i.e., the pandemic and the start of the war in the Ukraine right on its heels.\n\nHowever, what the report\u2019s custodians care most about is data related to the occurrence security incidents and breaches\u2013with the former being any compromise of an information asset, and the latter exposure of data to unauthorized parties. And in 2021, researchers found that both experienced an unprecedented soar in occurrence.\u201cThe past year has been extraordinary in a number of ways, but it was certainly\nmemorable with regard to the murky world of cybercrime,\u201d they wrote in the report. \u201cFrom very well-publicized critical infrastructure attacks to massive supply-chain breaches, the financially motivated criminals and nefarious nation-state actors have rarely, if ever, come out swinging the way they did over the last 12 months.\u201dRansomware Here to StayThere were few surprises among the DBIR\u2019s key findings to those who observed the security landscape in 2021. In fact, some findings seem consistent with what the report has highlighted since its inception in 2008, one security professional observed.\u201cThe most important research by and for the cybersecurity industry is out and it feels like the movie GroundHog Day, where we are waking up to the same results year after year since the first report in 2008,\u201d John Gunn, CEO of security firm Token, wrote in an email to Threatpost.One finding that reflects a threat that\u2019s risen to prominence in just the last few years, however, is that ransomware continued its upward trend. This type of cybercrime\u2013which locks up company\u2019s data through intrusion and won\u2019t release it until the organization pays a heft extortion sum\u2014had an almost 13 percent increase year-over-year in 2021. The rise was as big as the last five years combined, in which the occurrence of ransomware rose overall 25 percent, researchers noted.\u201cRansomware\u2019s heyday continues, and is present in almost 70 percent of malware breaches this year,\u201d they wrote.Indeed, though ransomware groups have come and gone and federal authorities have taken great strides to crack down on this type of cybercrime, the gain is so lucrative for criminals that it will likely stick around for a while, security experts noted.\u201cRansomware is by far the most reliable way that cybercriminals can capitalize on compromising their victims,\u201d observed Chris Clemens, vice president of solutions architecture for security firm Cerberus Sentinel, in an email to Threatpost. \u201cNo other action attackers can take comes close to the ease and magnitude of guaranteeing a payout from their operations.\u201dSupply Chain Under FireSignificant attacks on the supply chain\u2014in which a breach occurs in one system or software that can easily spread across organizations\u2013 that demonstrated lasting repercussions also rose in prominence and occurrence in 2021, researchers found.\u201cFor anyone who deals with supply chains, third parties and partners, this has been a year to remember,\u201d they wrote.Without mentioning it by name, the Verizon team cited as an example the now-infamous SolarWinds supply-chain attack that occurred at the very end of 2020 and still had companies scrambling to react to the fallout well into 2021.Indeed, \u201csupply chain was responsible for 62 percent of system-intrusion incidents this year,\u201d researchers reported.\u00a0 Moreover, unlike a financially motivated threat actor, perpetrators of these crimes are often state-sponsored actors who prefer to \u201cskip the breach and keep the access,\u201d maintaining persistence on organization\u2019s networks for some time, researchers said.These attacks are so dangerous because, since the attack can start with one company but quickly travel to its customers and partners, there can be so many victims involved, researchers.Further, often breaches that travel down the supply chain aren\u2019t discovered until long after attackers already have gained access to an organization\u2019s systems, making the potential for data breach and theft long-term more likely.Error, Human and OtherwiseTwo more key findings of the report are related in terms of where the ultimate responsibility lies\u2014someone either inside or outside an organization that makes a mistake. Indeed, human error continues to be a dominant trend for how and why breaches occur, researchers found.\u201cError continues to be a dominant trend and is responsible for 13 percent of breaches,\u201d researchers noted. This finding is primarily due to misconfigured cloud storage, which of course is typically the responsibility of the person or people responsible for setting up the system, they said.In fact, 82 percent of the breaches analyzed in the DBIR in 2021 involved what researchers call \u201cthe human element, which can be any number of things, they said.\u201cWhether it is the use of stolen credentials, phishing, misuse, or simply an error, people continue to play a very large role in incidents and breaches alike,\u201d researchers wrote.Oldest Risk in the BookSecurity experts expressed little surprise over the \u201chuman-element\u201d finding, which is one that\u2019s plagued the tech industry since even before security and the whole industry around it was a thing, noted one security professional.\u201cIt has been that way since the beginning of computers and likely will be that way for decades to come,\u201d noted Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist for security firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.Many of the errors that occur today are the result of clever social-engineering on the part of attackers, particularly in phishing attacks that trick people into clicking malicious files or links that allow computer access or provide personal credentials that can be used to compromise enterprise systems, he said.The only way to solve security issues created by human error is through education, whether it be about misconfiguration errors, the importance of patching, stolen credentials, and or just \u201cregular errors, such as when a user accidentally emails the wrong person data,\u201d Grimes said.\u201cHumans have always been a big part of the computing picture, but for some reason, we always thought only technology solutions alone can fix or prevent issues,\u201d he observed. \u201cThree decades of trying to fix cybersecurity issues by focusing on everything but the human element has shown that it is not a workable strategy.BreachCritical InfrastructureMalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Illinois-based Lincoln College was established during the U.S. Civil War. Since then it has weathered two world wars, the Spanish Flu, the Great Depression, the Great Recession and a devastating fire. But two things it couldn\u2019t survive?A ransomware attack and financial pressures tied to the impact of COVID-19 on its enrollment.On Friday, the university announced, due to financial distress from COVID-19 and cybersecurity issues, it is shutting its doors.\nIt\u2019s a warning sign for academic institutions around the country that have been disproportionately targeted by ransomware attacks. That\u2019s why some universities are now taking new and remarkable measures to protect themselves against the threat of ransomware attacks.The Ransomware AttackIn a March letter posted online and authored by Lincoln President David Gerlach, he explained the school\u2019s plight.\u201cThe institution experienced record-breaking student enrollment in Fall 2019, with residence halls at maximum capacity,\u201d he explained. But then, of course, \u201cthe coronavirus pandemic dramatically impacted recruitment and fundraising efforts.\u201dThus the 157-year-old college was in an already precarious financial state when, in Dec. 2021, it fell prey to ransomware.The attack \u201cthwarted admissions activities and hindered access to all institutional data, creating an unclear picture of Fall 2022 enrollment projections. All systems required for recruitment, retention, and fundraising efforts were inoperable.\u201d In an interview with The Chicago Tribune last month, Gerlach admitted that the college paid their ransom \u2013 under $100,000 \u2013 to their Iranian hackers. They got their data back, but it took months longer to fully restore their IT systems.Why Cybercriminals Target SchoolsAccording to Emsisoft, over 1,000 U.S. schools were targeted with ransomware last year alone \u2013 more than any other sector besides healthcare.Clearly colleges, many cash strapped like Lincoln, aren\u2019t goldmines. So why are cyber attackers targeting the education sector so relentlessly?Part of what makes schools attractive targets is the troves of unique and sensitive data they possess. As Edward Vasko, director at the Boise State Institute for Pervasive Cybersecurity, explained via email:\u201cThe data captured and stored by schools includes not only personally identifiable information (PII) of students, faculty and staff, but also PII of parents, donors and other partners of the school. This treasure trove of data, if captured and held for ransom, can easily bring an institution to its knees.\u201dThen consider the attack surface. New students every year travel to and from school buildings all the time. They carry all kinds of personal devices (read: infection vectors), and access all kinds of different networks and data when they do. IT administrators are at a loss, because there\u2019s no way around it.\u201cThe data within commercial or private sector companies is typically only accessible to employees, and often on a \u2018need to know\u2019 basis,\u201d James Turgal, vice president of Cyber Risk, Strategy and Board Relations at Optiv, pointed out via email.\u201cUniversity data is shared with academics all over the world, along with students and professors who access resources on their own \u2013 more often than not on unpatched devices, with universities maintaining little or no control over those personal devices,\u201d he said.There\u2019s also the problem of pain tolerance. As Lincoln demonstrated, recovery from ransomware attacks is a monthslong process, even after a ransom is paid.\u201cAnd while any business would struggle to survive after losing a quarter of the year,\u201d Ray Steen, chief strategy officer at MainSpring, told Threatpost. \u201cSchools run on a very tight schedule. That is part of the reason they are targeted by ransomware actors, who assume that administrators will be eager to pay a ransom to keep classes going.\u201dImmersive Labs found that educational institutions pay ransoms 25 percent of the time \u2013 more than any other sector.How Schools Can Defeat AttackersSchools face many unique cyber challenges, yet lack the resources to defend against them.There\u2019s no way to solve the first half of that problem without fundamentally hindering how schools operate. That\u2019s why some academic institutions are focusing on the second half.\u201cOne option open to schools and universities without significant endowments is to pool their resources and partner with other entities,\u201d wrote Scott Shackelford, professor in the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University (IU), via email. IU runs a cyber response center called OmniSOC.OmniSOC pools resources from nearly a half dozen universities, such as Rutgers, Northwestern and Purdue. \u201cOmniSOC monitors data and aggregates threat activity and intelligence across all member networks to identify threats faster, which then gets shared with member networks and on-campus teams for further investigation,\u201d Shackelford said.Boise State University\u2019s \u201cCyberdome\u201d offers something similar.\u00a0The program operates as a centralized cyber response hub for schools and other small and rural organizations across the state of Idaho. Its goal, according to Vasko, is \u201cto protect rural communities such as schools that often cannot afford to deploy, hire, and maintain critically needed security tools and personnel.\u201dCooperation among groups of academic institutions may be the answer to academia\u2019s ransomware problem. Because in the face of wealthy, well-resourced and sometimes state-sponsored threat actors, one school can hardly be expected to defend itself.Lincoln College learned that lesson the hard way.MalwareVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves declared a state of national cybersecurity emergency over the weekend following a financially motivated Conti ransomware attack against his administration that has hamstrung the government and economy of the Latin American nation.The attack\u2014attributed to the prolific Conti ransomware group\u2013occurred three weeks ago not long after Chaves took office; in fact, the state of emergency was one of his first decrees as president. The first government agency attacked was the Ministry of Finance, which has been without digital services since April 18, according to a published report.Other Costa Rican agencies affected include the Ministry of Labor and Social Security; the Ministry of Science, Innovation, Technology and Telecommunications; the National Meteorological Institute, among others.\u00a0At this time, the entire scope of the damage is not known.\nConti reportedly demanded a ransom of $10 million from Costa Rica\u2019s government in exchange for not releasing stolen information from the Ministry of Finance, according to a published report. Costa Rica so far has declined to pay, which resulted in Conti updating its data-leak site on Monday with 97 percent of the 672 GB of data that the group claims contains information stolen from Costa Rican government agencies, BleepingComputer \u00a0reported.Conti\u2014a top-tier Russian-speaking ransomware group\u2013is known as one of the most ruthless gangs in the game, with a take-no-prisoners approach specializing in double extortion, a method in which attackers threaten to expose stolen data or use it for future attacks if victims don\u2019t pay by a deadline.Conti acts on a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model, with a vast network of affiliates and access brokers at its disposal to do its dirty work. The group also is known for targeting organizations for which attacks could have life-threatening consequences, such as hospitals, emergency number dispatch carriers, emergency medical services and law-enforcement agencies.The attack on Costa Rica could be a sign of more Conti activity to come, as the group posted a message on their news site to the Costa Rican government that the attack is merely a \u201cdemo version.\u201d The group also said the attack was solely motivated by financial gain as well as expressed general political disgust, another signal of more government-directed attacks.Next-Level IncidentThe incident demonstrates how a cyber-attack can potentially be as serious as a military action or a natural disaster especially when it affects a developing nation like Costa Rica, a security professional observed.\u201cCosta Rica\u2019s state-of-emergency following an attack from Conti is an important rallying call to the rest of the world,\u201d Silas Cutler, principal reverse engineer for security firm Stairwell, wrote in an e-mail to Threatpost. \u201cWhile the emergency status may have a limited direct impact \u2026 it puts the severity of this breach into the same category as a natural disaster or military incident.\u201dThe double-extortion aspect of not only Conti\u2019s but also a number of other ransomware group\u2019s methods also can embolden more ransomware attacks because most targeted organizations will pay rather than risk the leak of sensitive data\u2014providing more incentive to threat actors, noted another security professional.\u201cIt is a large reason why most victims are paying today,\u201d observed Roger Grimes, data-driven defense evangelist for security firm KnowBe4, in an email to Threatpost.Conti likely has every employee\u2019s personal login credentials to any Costa Rican government site that they visited during the time the ransomware\u00a0was active on the system before it locked files, which poses a big problem for citizens using government services online if Conti indeed has leaked the info, he said.\u201cIf Costa Rica\u00a0was hosting customer-facing websites\u00a0in the compromised domains, like they likely were, their customers\u2019 credentials\u2013which are often reused on other sites and services the customers visit\u2013are likely compromised, too,\u201d Grimes said. \u201cNot paying the ransom puts not only Costa Rica\u2019s own services at risk, but those of their employees and customers.\u201dIndeed, last year the city of Tulsa, OK, put its citizens on alert for potential cyber fraud after Conti leaked some 18,000 city files, mostly police citations, on the dark web following a ransomware attack on the city\u2019s government.U.S. Offering AidTo help prevent future attacks like the one on Costa Rica, the U.S. government said last week that it\u2019s offering a hefty reward\u2013up to $10 million\u2013for information leading to the identification and/or location of any of Conti Group\u2019s leaders. The U.S. also will offer up to $5 million for info that can lead to the arrest or conviction of anyone conspiring in a Conti ransomware attack.To date, Conti has been responsible for hundreds of ransomware incidents over the past two years, with more than 1,000 victims paying more than $150 million to the group, according to the FBI. This gives Conti the dubious honor of being the costliest ransomware strain ever documented, according to the feds.While authorities pursue Conti, governments can take a number of steps to prevent ransomware attacks, security professionals noted. One is to adopt a cultural change when it comes to cybersecurity, observed Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at security firm Cerberus Sentinel.Governments should shift their focus from the historic mentality of cyber-security as an \u201cIT cost center\u201d toward one that views it as \u201ca culturally ingrained approach that identifies cybersecurity investment, both in tools and people, as a critical strategic defensive shield,\u2019 he said in an email to Threatpost.\u201cUntil this changes, the problem of cyber-attack is going to get worse before it gets any better,\u201d Clements said in an email to Threatpost.Governments also can take proactive steps such as conducting perimeter reviews as a means of mitigating some of the methods Conti-affiliated access brokers use to infiltrate systems, Cutler suggested. This can better secure their perimeters and allow them to react faster to attacks.However, even this \u201cwill not fully prevent these types of attacks\u201d given the network of affiliates and access brokers that RaaS groups like Conti have at its disposal to breach systems, he said.GovernmentMalware",

        "raw text": "Cryptocurrency thief Lazarus Group appears to be widening its scope into using ransomware as a way to rip off financial institutions and other targets in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, researchers have found.Financial transactions and similarities to previous malware in its source code link a recently emerged ransomware strain called VHD to the North Korean threat actors, also known as Unit 180 or APT35.Researchers at cybersecurity firm Trellix has been tracking attacks on financial institutions from what they believe is North Korea\u2019s cyber army\u2014which typically generate from Lazarus Group\u2014for the last few years. The group is perhaps best known for its deftness at ripping off the crypto-currency market through money-laundering schemes to raise money for the North Korean government.However, Lazarus also appears to have been playing the ransomware game for at least a year, Trellix revealed in a blog post this week. Researchers found that Bitcoin transactions and connections to code from ransomware previously used by the group make it likely that VHD, which emerged in March 2020, is the work of APT38, they said.Financial Attacks Raise SuspicionA significant precursor to linking Lazarus to VHD was an attempt by threat actors in February 2016 to transfer nearly US$1 billion through the SWIFT system towards recipients at other banks, according to the post by Trellix researcher Christian Beek.\u201cThe investigation, performed by several U.S. agencies, led to a North Korean actor, dubbed \u2018Hidden Cobra,'\u201d he wrote. \u201cEver since then, the group has been active, compromising numerous victims.\u201dHidden Cobra, active since 2014, is believed to be the work of Lazarus Group. In 2017, the FBI warned that the group was targeting U.S. businesses with malware- and botnet-related attacks.\u201cOver time we have observed several methods North Korea has used to gain money,\u201d Beek wrote \u201cAlthough not as frequently observed as other groups, there have also been attempts made to step into the world of ransomware.\u201dTrellix has followed North Korean-linked actors\u2019 attacks on financial institutions\u2014such as global banks, blockchain providers and users from South Korea\u2013over the last few years. Tactics used included spear-phishing emails as well as the use of fake mobile applications and companies, researchers noted.\u201cSince these attacks were predominantly observed targeting the APAC region with targets in Japan and Malaysia for example, we anticipate these attacks might have been executed to discover if ransomware is a valuable way of gaining income,\u201d Beek wrote.Code LinksKnowing that ransomware has emerged a part of the toolkit of the North Korean cyber army, Trellix researchers peered under the hood of the VHD code to find similarities that they believed pointed to reuse from previous ransomware, Beek wrote.\u201cUsing those [code] blocks as a starting point, a hunt was started from March 2020 onwards to discover related families,\u201d he wrote.Researchers identified code from four ransomware families known to be used by North Korean threat actors\u2014BGEAF, PXJ, ZZZZ and CHiCHi\u2013in the code of VHD.While the Tflower and ChiChi families share only generic-function code with VHD, \u201cthe ZZZZ ransomware is almost an exact clone of the Beaf ransomware family,\u201d which has been linked to North Korea, Beek wrote.\u201cAnother observation is that the four letters of the ransomware \u2018BEAF\u2019 \u2026 are exactly the same first four bytes of the handshake of APT38\u2019s tool known as Beefeater,\u201d he added.The use of the MATA framework in VHD\u2014which has been used to spread the Tflower ransomware family\u2014also links the VHD to Lazarus, as MATA has previously been linked to North Korea, researchers said.Following the MoneyResearchers then investigated the various ransomware families they\u2019d linked to North Korea, which all seemed to target specific entities in APAC regions, to try to find financial overlap between then.They extracted the Bitcoin \u00a0wallet addresses and started tracing and monitoring the transactions, though they did not find overlap in the wallets themselves, Beek wrote.\u201cWe did find, however, that the paid ransom amounts were relatively small,\u201d he wrote, linking a pattern between the ransomware families attributed to North Korean actors.For example, a transaction of 2.2 Bitcoin in mid-2020 was worth around $US20,00 and was transferred multiple times through December 2020, researchers found. At that time, a transaction took place on a Bitcoin exchange to either cash out\u2013as the value had roughly doubled\u2013or exchange for a different and less traceable cryptocurrency, they said.\u201cWe suspect the ransomware families \u2026 are part of more organized attacks,\u201d Beek wrote. \u201cBased on our research, combined intelligence, and observations of the smaller targeted ransomware attacks, Trellix attributes them to [North Korean] hackers with high confidence.\u201dGovernmentHacks",

        "raw text": "High-end Italian fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna revealed on Monday that it was the target of a ransomware attack last August \u2014 and that it managed to recover its systems from back-up without paying a ransom.The Milan-based firm already had revealed on Aug. 6, 2021, that it became aware of unauthorized access to its systems but did not disclose the specific type of breach.In a public filing this week, however, the company acknowledged that it was a ransomware attack that \u201cimpacted the majority of our IT systems\u201d and ultimately led to some private accounting data stolen in the incident to be leaked online.Indeed, the RansomExx ransomware operation claimed responsibility for the August attack and published leaked data stolen from the company online the day Zegna fist announced the incident, according to a report published by Bleeping Computer.\u201cAs we refused to engage in discussions relating to the payment of the ransom, the responsible parties published certain accounting materials extracted from our IT systems,\u201d Zegna wrote in the filing, an SEC Form 424B3. These forms are used to update a company\u2019s investment prospectus, in this case to inform them of risk related to cyber-incidents or data breaches.Zegna gradually restored its IT systems \u2014 which include multiple server locations, third-party cloud providers and a range of software applications for different regions and functions \u2014 from secure back-up servers during the weeks following the breach, the company said.\u201cAlthough our systems are diversified\u2026we periodically assess and implement actions to ameliorate risks to our systems, a significant or large-scale malfuction or interruption of our systems could adversely affect our ability to manage and keep our operations running efficiently, and damage our reputation if we are unable to track transactions and deliver products to our customers,\u201d the company said in the filing.Resisting the Pressure to PayWhile many companies choose to pay a ransom during such an attack to unlock data or prevent it from being leaked online, security professionals generally recommend that they don\u2019t because it only encourages cybercriminals.However, many ransomware groups now regularly resort to a method called double extortion, in which they not only lock up victims\u2019 IT systems but also threaten to leak sensitive data online if the organization doesn\u2019t pay by a certain time, which adds pressure and often results in a quick payout.\u201cAs these things go, it\u2019s fantastic that Ermenegildo Zegna recovered without capitulating to the cybercriminal gang\u2019s ultimatums,\u201d observed Chris Clements, vice president of solutions architecture at security firm Cerberus Sentinel, in an email to Threatpost. \u201cNot paying cybercriminals extortion demands is one of the most effective ways to deter cyberattacks, but far too few companies that find themselves in similar situations to restore operations in a timely fashion.\u201dIndeed, even if they can restore via back-up systems, it\u2019s the hurry to get back online and fully operational that often makes organizations cave to demands. But with ransomware such a common occurrence in the threat landscape, there is no excuse for companies not to plan for a speedy in-house recovery in the event of an attack, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve long since reached the point that organizations of any size and in any vertical must assume that they may potentially fall victim to a comparable cyberattack and implement a strategy not only for prevention, but also for restoring systems and data at company-wide scale should the worst happen,\u201d Clements said.The attack on Zegna also reiterates the scenario that any organization, no matter how large or small, can be a target of ransomware attacks, he added. Though it\u2019s one of the top menswear brands in the world in terms of revenue, Zegna, for example, has about 6,500 employees globally\u2013making it a relatively small fish compared to some global multinationals.\u201cWith ransomware extortion payouts routinely venturing into millions of dollars, cybercriminals have a powerful incentive to compromise every organization they are able to,\u201d Clements said.Moving to the cloud?

        "raw text": "Google is warning victims in Kazakhstan and Italy that they are being targeted by Hermit, a sophisticated and modular spyware from Italian vendor RCS Labs that not only can steal data but also record and make calls.Researchers from Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) revealed details in a blog post Thursday by TAG researchers Benoit Sevens and Clement Lecigne about campaigns that send a unique link to targets to fake apps impersonating legitimate ones to try to get them to download and install the spyware. None of the fake apps were found on either Apple\u2019s or Google\u2019s respective mobile app stores, however, they said.TAG is attributing the capabilities to notorious surveillance software vendor RCS Labs, which previously was linked to spyware activity employed by an agent of the Kazakhstan government against domestic targets, and identified by Lookout research.\u201cWe are detailing capabilities we attribute to RCS Labs, an Italian vendor that uses a combination of tactics, including atypical drive-by downloads as initial infection vectors, to target mobile users on both iOS and Android,\u201d a Google TAG spokesperson wrote in an email to Threatpost sent Thursday afternoon.All campaigns that TAG observed originated with a unique link sent to the target that then tries to lure users into downloading Hermit spyware in one of two ways, researchers wrote in the post. Once clicked, victims are redirected to a web page for downloading and installing a surveillance app on either Android or iOS.\u201cThe page, in Italian, asks the user to install one of these applications in order to recover their account,\u201d with WhatsApp download links specifically pointing to attacker-controlled content for Android or iOS users, researchers wrote.Collaborating with ISPsOne lure employed by threat actors is to work with the target\u2019s ISP to disable his or her mobile data connectivity, and then masquerade as a carrier application sent in a link to try to get the target to install a malicious app to recover connectivity, they said.Researchers outlined in a separate blog post by Ian Beer of Google Project Zero a case in which they discovered what appeared to be an iOS app from Vodafone but which in fact is a fake app. Attackers are sending a link to this malicious app by SMS to try to fool targets into downloading the Hermit spyware.\u201cThe SMS claims that in order to restore mobile data connectivity, the target must install the carrier app and includes a link to download and install this fake app,\u201d Beer wrote.Indeed, this is likely the reason why most of the applications they observed in the Hermit campaign masqueraded as mobile carrier applications, Google TAG researchers wrote.In other cases when they can\u2019t work directly with ISPs, threat actors use apps appearing to be messaging applications to hide Hermit, according to Google TAG, confirming what Lookout previously discovered in its research.iOS Campaign RevealedWhile Lookout previously shared details of how Hermit targeting Android devices works, Google TAG revealed specifics of how the spyware functions on iPhones.They also released details of the host of vulnerabilities\u2014two of which were zero-day bugs when they were initially identified by Google Project Zero\u2014that attackers exploit in their campaign. In fact, Beer\u2019s post is a technical analysis of one of the bugs: CVE-2021-30983 internally referred to as Clicked3 and fixed by Apple in December 2021.To distribute the iOS application, attackers simply followed Apple instructions on how to distribute proprietary in-house apps to Apple devices and used the itms-services protocol with a manifest file with com.ios.Carrier as the identifier, researchers outlined.The resulting app is signed with a certificate from a company named 3-1 Mobile SRL that was enrolled in the Apple Developer Enterprise Program, thus legitimizing the certificate on iOS devices, they said.The iOS app itself is broken up into multiple parts, researchers said, including a generic privilege escalation exploit wrapper which is used by six different exploits for previously identified bugs. In addition to Clieked3, the other bugs exploited are:CVE-2018-4344 internally referred to and publicly known as LightSpeed;CVE-2019-8605 internally referred to as SockPort2 and publicly known as SockPuppet;CVE-2020-3837 internally referred to and publicly known as TimeWaste;CVE-2020-9907 internally referred to as AveCesare; andCVE-2021-30883 internally referred to as Clicked2, marked as being exploited in-the-wild by Apple in October 2021.All exploits used before 2021 are based on public exploits written by different jailbreaking communities, researchers added.Broader ImplicationsThe emergence of Hermit spyware shows how threat actors\u2014often working as state-sponsored entities\u2014are pivoting to using new surveillance technologies and tactics following the blow-up over repressive regimes\u2019 use of Israel-based NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware in cyberattacks against dissidents, activists and NGOs, as well as the murders of journalists.Indeed, while use of spyware like Hermit may be legal under national or international laws, \u201cthey are often found to be used by governments for purposes antithetical to democratic values: targeting dissidents, journalists, human rights workers and opposition party politicians,\u201d Google TAG researchers wrote.The United States blacklisted NSO Group over the activity, which drew international attention and ire. But it apparently has not stopped the proliferation of spyware for nefarious purposes in the slightest, according to Google TAG.In fact, the commercial spyware industry continues to thrive and grow at a significant rate, which \u201cshould be concerning to all Internet users,\u201d researchers wrote.\u201cThese vendors are enabling the proliferation of dangerous hacking tools and arming governments that would not be able to develop these capabilities in-house,\u201d they said.Mobile SecurityPrivacy",

        "raw text": "An agent of the Kazakhstan government has been using enterprise-grade spyware against domestic targets, according to Lookout research published last week.The government entity used brand impersonation to trick victims into downloading the malware, dubbed \u201cHermit.\u201d Hermit is an advanced, modular program developed by RCS Lab, a notorious Italian company that specializes in digital surveillance. It has the power to do all kinds of spying on a target\u2019s phone \u2013 not just collect data, but also record and make calls.The timing of this spying operation holds extra significance. In the first week of 2022, anti-government protests were met with violent crackdowns across Kazakhstan. 227 people died in all, and nearly 10,000 were arrested. Four months later is when researchers discovered the latest samples of Hermit making rounds.The IntrusionHow do you get a target to download their own spyware?In this campaign, the perpetrators use OPPO \u2013 Guangdong Oppo Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Ltd \u2013 a Chinese mobile and electronics manufacturer \u2013 as its ploy to earn trust among targets. According to researchers, agents working on the behalf of the government send SMS messages purporting to come from OPPO, which is actually a maliciously hijacked link to the company\u2019s official Kazakh-language support page: http[://]oppo-kz[.]custhelp[.]com. (At the time of the report\u2019s publication, that support page had gone offline.) In some instances, the attackers also impersonate Samsung and Vivo, according to Lookout.The intrusion requires the victim to open the SMS message and click the link to the hijacked page. While it\u2019s loaded, the malware downloads simultaneously in the background of the target machine, then connects to a C2 server hosted by a small service provider in Nur-Sultan, the capital of the country.As Paul Shunk, security researcher at Lookout, wrote in a statement: \u201cThe combination of the targeting of Kazakh-speaking users and the location of the backend C2 server is a strong indication that the campaign is controlled by an entity in Kazakhstan.\u201d Though the Lookout researchers identified that entity as belonging to the state government, they did not attribute a particular government official or department.The MalwareHermit isn\u2019t just sophisticated, it\u2019s wholly customizable.It\u2019s built modularly, meaning that its owners can use or ignore some of its 25 known components, each of which serve a different function. It also means that the deployment of any given instance of Hermit might be different than the next.Among those many functions are the ability to record audio, make and redirect calls, and collect data on a victim\u2019s smartphone.Then there are more niche functions. For example, as the researchers noted in their report, \u201cthe spyware also attempts to maintain data integrity of collected \u2018evidence\u2019 by sending a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC). This allows the actors to authenticate who sent the data as well as ensure the data is unchanged.\u201d Why is this interesting? Because \u201cusing this method for data transmission may enable the admissibility of collected evidence.\u201d\u201cThe discovery of Hermit adds another puzzle piece to the picture of the secretive market for \u2018lawful intercept\u2019 surveillance tools,\u201d wrote Shunk. \u201cIf there is legitimate use of this technology, it certainly requires strict oversight and protections against abuse.\u201dMalwareMobile Security",

Catalonia\u2019s government and elected officials were also extensively targeted,\u201d wrote authors of the Citizen Lab report that included John Scott-Railton, Elies Campo, Bill Marczak, Bahr Abdul Razzak, Siena Anstis, G\u00f6zde B\u00f6c\u00fc, Salvatore Solimano and Ron Deibert.They wrote \u201cthe highest levels of Catalan government to members of the European Parliament, legislators, and their staff and family members\u201d were also targeted.Regarding who directed the attacks? Researchers said it was \u201cnot conclusively attributing the operations to a specific entity,\u201d however evidence suggests Spanish authorities were likely behind the operation. It called out Spain\u2019s National Intelligence Center (CNI) as the likely mastermind, citing the organization\u2019s history of surveillance and espionage scandals.CatalanGate: Malware SpecificsThe Catalan attackers infected victims through at least two exploits: zero-click exploits and malicious SMS messages. Zero-click exploits are challenging to defend against, given that they do not require victims to engage in any activity.Citizen Lab alleges, victims were targeted with the Pegasus malware using the zero-click iOS exploit (HOMAGE) and a known malicious SMS message vulnerability, circa 20215, used by the NSO Group to spread its Pegasus malware.Researchers wrote: \u201cThe HOMAGE exploit appears to have been in use during the last months of 2019, and involved an iMessage zero-click component that launched a WebKit instance in the com.apple.mediastream.mstreamd process, following a com.apple.private.alloy.photostream lookup for a Pegasus email address.\u201dHOMAGE was also believed to have been used six time in 2019 and 2020. Citizen Lab said Apple devices running a version of its mobile operating system greater than 13.1.3 (released September 2019) are not vulnerable to attacks.Other Malware/Exploits Used in CampaignsResearchers said the KISMET zero-click exploit was also used in the attacks. In December 2020, Citizen Lab said phones of 36 journalists were infected with KISMET by four separate APTs, possibly linked to Saudi Arabia or the UAE.The WhatsApp buffer overflow bug (CVE-2019-3568), exploited by the NSO Group in the CatalanGate attacks, had previously been reported by Citizen Lab in 2019 and was patched in May of 2019. At the time, the\u00a0Financial Times reported a \u201cprivate company\u201d believed to be the NSO Group created the zero-day attack to sell to its customers.As part of the Catalan attacks, researchers say four individuals were targeted or infected using the \u00a0Candiru spyware firm\u2019s spyware, also called Candiru. These attacks attempted to take advantage of two now patched zero-day bugs (CVE-2021-31979, CVE-2021-33771) \u2013 both Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerabilities \u2013 were used by Candiru. Both were discovered by Microsoft and patched in July 2021.\u201cWe identified a total of seven emails containing the Candiru spyware, via links to the domain name stat[.]email,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201cCandiru\u2019s spyware showed that Candiru was designed for extensive access to the victim device, such as extracting files and browser content, but also stealing messages saved in the encrypted Signal Messenger Desktop app.\u201dIn August 2021, Citizen Lab reported a never-before-seen, zero-click iMessaging exploit had been used to illegally spy on Bahraini activists with NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware.Citizen Lab described the campaigns as \u201chigh volume\u201d and examples of \u201cunrestrained abuses\u201d of privacy that point to a \u201cserious absence of regulatory constraints\u201d over the sale of spyware to government clients and others.\u201cIt is now well established that NSO Group, Candiru, other companies like them, as well as their various ownership groups, have utterly failed to put in place even the most basic safeguards against abuse of their spyware. What we find in Spain is yet another indictment of this industry,\u201d it wrote.\u00a0MalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "ForcedEntry \u2013 the exploit of a zero-click iMessage zero day that circumvented Apple\u2019s then-brand-new BlastDoor security feature starting a year ago \u2013 was picked apart not just by NSO Group with its Pegasus spyware but also by a newly uncovered, smaller smartphone-hacking toolmaker named QuaDream.Reuters published details on QuaDream last week. The outlet relied on input from five sources familiar with the matter, plus a look at two QuaDream product brochures dating from 2019 and 2020 that its reporters got their hands on.Three people familiar with the matter told Reuters that QuaDream and NSO Group have shared employees over the years. Two sources also said that QuaDream and NSO Group came up with the iPhone exploit techniques on their own, separately \u2014 as opposed to collaborating.In September, Citizen Lab published details about having captured NSO Group\u2019s ForcedEntry exploit in the wild, though its security researchers believe that it was first used in February 2021. Apple had just introduced BlastDoor, a structural improvement in iOS 14 meant to block message-based, zero-click exploits \u2013 a month prior to when NSO Group is believed to have started using it.Months earlier, in August, the privacy watchdog identified nine Bahraini activists whose iPhones were hacked with NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware between June 2020 and last February. Some of the activists were attacked with what Citizen Lab came to call the 2021 ForcedEntry exploit, while others\u2019 devices were remotely exploited and infected with spyware by the 2020 KISMET exploit: another zero-click iMessage exploit.BlastDoor was supposed to prevent this type of attack by acting as what Google Project Zero\u2019s Samuel Gro\u00df called at the time a \u201ctightly sandboxed\u201d service responsible for \u201calmost all\u201d of the parsing of untrusted data in iMessages. The ForcedEntry exploit managed to circumvent BlastDoor by targeting Apple\u2019s image rendering library: a sophisticated attack that was effective against Apple iOS, MacOS and WatchOS devices.QuaDream Got in on the FunQuaDream was allegedly in on the Bahraini malware infections, it turns out, including an attack on one living in London at the time.According to Reuters, the firm was founded in 2016 by Ilan Dabelstein, a former Israeli military official, and by two former NSO employees, Guy Geva and Nimrod Reznik. Reuters\u2019 sources for QuaDream\u2019s background were Israeli corporate records and two people familiar with the business.Its 2016 founding means that QuaDream has spent more than five years hacking iPhones and other iGadgets, prying them open so as to monitor calls and get access to users\u2019 microphones and cameras in real time. This type of powerful spyware gives its users access to their targets\u2019 email, photos, texts, contacts and instant messages, even in spite of what should be the end-to-end encryption promised by services such as WhatsApp, Telegram or Signal.There\u2019s So Much Talent Out There, UnfortunatelyCitizen Lab security researcher Bill Marczak, who\u2019s been studying both companies\u2019 tools, told Reuters that the zero-click capability of QuaDream\u2019s flagship product \u2013 called REIGN \u2013 seems \u201con par\u201d with NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware.As Reuters noted, security researchers at Google\u2019s Project Zero have called ForcedEntry \u201cone of the most technically sophisticated exploits\u201d they\u2019ve ever captured: an estimation confirmed by Citizen Lab director Ronald Deibert.On Monday, he pointed to Project Zero\u2019s \u201cvery thorough\u201d analysis of ForcedEntry as having demonstrated the level of engineering talent available to companies like NSO Group and others in the mercenary spyware marketplace.\u201cThat spyware can be engineered with such sophistication and stealth, and then abused widely to target broad cross sections of civil society, should give everyone serious pause,\u201d he told Threatpost via email.Israeli Police Linked to Widespread Pegasus SpyingA related piece of news emerged on Monday. According to a new report from the Israeli newspaper Calcalist, dozens of prominent Israelis have been hacked with Pegasus, including a son of former premier Benjamin Netanyahu, activists and senior government officials.\u201cCEOs of government ministries, journalists, tycoons, corporate executives, mayors, social activists and even the Prime Minister\u2019s relatives, all were police targets, having their phones hacked by NSO\u2019s spyware, prior to any investigation even opening and without any judicial authorization,\u201d Calcalist reported.Pegasus was also recently found on the devices of Finland\u2019s diplomatic corps serving outside the country as part of a wide-ranging espionage campaign, Finnish officials claimed. In December, Pegasus was also reportedly planted on the iPhones of at least nine U.S. State Department employees.QuaDream: Less Known But Just as PowerfulAccording to QuaDream\u2019s brochures for the REIGN \u201cPremium Collection,\u201d its malware tools offer similar capabilities as Pegasus, including \u201creal-time call recordings,\u201d \u201ccamera activation \u2013 front and back,\u201d and \u201cmicrophone activation,\u201d as Reuters reported.The outlet\u2019s sources said that QuaDream and NSO Group share several buyers, including Saudi Arabia and Mexico, both of which are among the many governmental Pegasus buyers that have been accused of illegally using spyware to target political opponents. QuaDream\u2019s first clients also allegedly include the Singaporean government. As well, the firm apparently made a pitch to the Indonesian government, though Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether Indonesia ponied up.Its prices appear to vary. According to the 2019 brochure, one offering that gave customers the ability to infect 50 devices per year was priced at $2.2 million, \u201cexclusive of maintenance costs,\u201d though two people familiar with REIGN\u2019s sales told Reuters that the price for REIGN \u201cwas typically higher.\u201dHow Vast *Is* the Spyware Market?Kudos to Reuters for digging up details on QuaDream: not an easy task, given how murky the company is. It reportedly has no website, and employees have reportedly been told to stay mum about the company on their social-media posts.John Bambenek, principal threat hunter at digital IT and security operations company Netenrich, told Threatpost on Monday that discretion is the hallmark of spyware sellers. \u201cEvery intelligence agency worth their salt (or more accurately their budgets) are developing these kinds of exploits in house or via closely-associated companies who do not do business with many other countries,\u201d he said via email. \u201cChina, for instance, has done great work in mobile exploitation that seems to have been government performed effort. For every player we know about, there are dozens that are much more secretive.\u201dThe fact that there are more spyware-makers than just NSO Group is no shocker.That was made clear in December by Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, which kicked six alleged spy-for-hire \u201ccyber-mercenaries\u201d to the curb, along with a mysterious Chinese law-enforcement supplier. Meta accused the entities of collectively targeting about 50,000 people for surveillance, issued cease-and-desist warnings to six of the groups, and undertook the task of warning targeted people in more than 100 countries.Mike Parkin, engineer at SaaS enterprise cyber-risk remediation firm Vulcan Cyber, told Threatpost that bleeding-edge attacks will continue to appear, given \u201can entire Dark-Web economy built around discovering exploits and selling them to the highest bidder, and state/state-sponsored actors having access to extraordinary financial and technical resources.\u201dThere are \u201calmost certainly\u201d exploits similar to ForcedEntry already being used in the wild, Parkin said: ones that haven\u2019t yet come to light \u201cbecause they are used sparingly and only against high-value targets.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand online town halls \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentHacksMalwareMobile SecurityPrivacyVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "The controversial Pegasus spyware, developed by NSO Group, has been found on the devices of Finland\u2019s diplomatic corps serving outside the country as part of a wide-ranging espionage campaign, according to Finnish officials.They also said the infections were of the zero-click variety.\u201cThe highly sophisticated malware has infected users\u2019 Apple or Android telephones without their noticing and without any action from the user\u2019s part,\u201d Finland\u2019s Ministry for Foreign Affairs announced.\u00a0 \u201cThrough the spyware, the perpetrators may have been able to harvest data from the device and exploit its features.\u201dThe disclosure said the espionage campaign was shut down and that the case was being investigated throughout the \u201cautumn and winter 2021-2022.\u201dAlthough Finnish diplomatic communications conducted over mobile devices are usually not of the highest sensitivity, the Ministry added, the compromise is something the government is taking seriously.\u201cInformation transmitted by telephone is public or classified at level 4 at the maximum, which is the lowest level of classified information,\u201d the Ministry said.\u00a0 \u201cHowever, it is worth noting that even if information is not directly classified, the information itself and its source may be subject to diplomatic confidentiality.\u201dThe Pegasus, NSO Group Threat This is precisely the type of scenario that put Israeli company NSO Group in the headlines when it was discovered the company had tools capable of monitoring private WhatsApp messages between journalists and human rights activists during a lawsuit filed by WhatsApp parent company Facebook in Oct. 2019.Last summer, the Guardian newspaper published a report from journalists who reviewed data leaked from NSO Group that found 50,000 phone numbers they believe were being monitored for their clients, dating back to 2016, including Amnesty International employees, human rights lawyers and more.NSO Group denies that it peddles malware to governments for spying and that it isn\u2019t helping nations monitor other countries or their citizens. But just last month, the U.S. State Department said it found Pegasus installed on the iPhones of at least nine employees working abroad \u2014 echoing the recent Finnish announcement.NSO said Pegasus doesn\u2019t work on devices in the U.S., but those outside the country could be targeted by the spyware. A Washington Post investigation turned up evidence Pegasus was downloaded on the devices of about a dozen Americans working overseas as journalists, aid workers and diplomats.Last November, NSO Group was added to the sanctions list by the U.S. Government for creating and selling the dangerous malware.The latest reports from Finland seem to fit the Pegasus pattern.Finland Also Targeted With Facebook Messenger Phishing Campaign Adding to Finland\u2019s cybersecurity woes, the country\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre warned that its citizens were being targeted by a Facebook Messenger phishing scam aimed at tricking users to give up their two-factor authentication codes and phone numbers to hijack their Facebook accounts.\u201cThe best way to protect yourself from this scam is to be wary of Facebook messages from all senders, including people you know,\u201d the Cyber Security center cautioned.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand online town halls\u00a0\u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.MalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "Attackers are targeting industrial enterprises with spyware campaigns that hunt for corporate credentials so they can be used both for financial gain and to cannibalize compromised networks to propagate future attacks, researchers have found.The campaigns use off-the-shelf spyware but are unique in that they limit the scope and lifetime of each sample to the bare minimum, according to researchers at Kaspersky ICS CERT who uncovered the campaigns.Researchers dubbed the attacks \u201canomalous\u201d because they veer from typical spyware attacks, Kaspersky\u2019s Kirill Kruglov wrote in a report published this week on the SecureList blog. Attackers use spearphishing emails sent from compromised corporate mailboxes that include malicious attachments that deliver spyware, he explained.\nThe attackers use SMTP services of industrial enterprises not only to send spearphishing emails but also to collect data stolen by spyware as a one-way command-and-control (C2) so they can mount future attacks, Kruglov explained.\u201cWe believe that initially stolen data is used by threat operators primarily to spread the attack inside the local network of the attacked organization (via phishing emails) and to attack other organizations in order to collect more credentials,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe attackers use corporate mailboxes compromised in earlier attacks as the C2 servers for new attacks.\u201dThe malware used in the attacks typically belong to \u201cwell-known commodity spyware families,\u201d such as AgentTesla/Origin Logger, HawkEye, Noon/Formbook, Masslogger, Snake Keylogger, Azorult and Lokibot, he noted.However, \u201cthese attacks stand out from the mainstream due to a very limited number of targets in each attack and a very short lifetime of each malicious sample,\u201d Kruglov wrote.Targeting ICS EnterprisesAbout 45 percent of targeted computers in the campaigns appear to be industrial control system (ICS)-related and have access to the corporate email service of their respective company, researchers said.Kaspersky researchers have identified more than 2,000 corporate email accounts belonging to industrial companies that have been stolen and abused as next-attack C2 in the campaigns. However, they estimate that more than 7,000 have actually been stolen, sold on the internet or \u201cabused in other ways,\u201d Kruglov wrote.\u201cAmongst attacks of this kind, we\u2019ve noticed a large set of campaigns that spread from one industrial enterprise to another via hard-to-detect phishing emails disguised as the victim organizations\u2019 correspondence and abusing their corporate email systems to attack through the contact lists of compromised mailboxes,\u201d he explained.Independent, Low-Skilled PerpetratorsResearchers believe the actors behind the analogous campaigns are \u201clow-skilled individuals and small groups\u201d operating independently, they said. Their aim is either to commit financial crimes using stolen credentials or to make money by selling access to corporate network servers and services.Indeed, they identified more than 25 different marketplaces where threat actors are selling the data stolen in the campaigns against industrial enterprises.\u201cAt these markets, various sellers offer thousands of RDP, SMTP, SSH, cPanel, and email accounts, as well as malware, fraud schemes, and samples of emails and webpages for social engineering,\u201d Kruglov explained.More dangerous threat actors like Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) and ransomware groups also can use the credentials to mount attacks, he added.To avoid compromise by the campaigns, Kaspersky recommends implementing two-factor authentication for corporate email access and other internet-facing services such as RDP and VPN-SSL gateways.Researchers also advise that organizations shore up endpoint security, train personnel to securely approach all incoming email, regularly check spam folders instead of just emptying them and monitor the exposure of the organization\u2019s accounts to the web, among other protections.Cannibal burger photo courtesy of Jack Lawrence.

        "raw text": "Researchers have tracked new spyware \u2013 dubbed \u201cPseudoManuscrypt\u201d because it\u2019s similar to \u201cManuscrypt\u201d malware from the Lazarus advanced persistent threat (APT) group \u2013 that\u2019s attempted to scribble itself across more than 35,000 targeted computers in 195 countries.Kaspersky researchers said in a Thursday report that from Jan. 20 to Nov. 10, the actors behind the vast campaign were targeting government organizations and industrial control systems (ICS) across a range of industries, including engineering, building automation, energy, manufacturing, construction, utilities and water management. At least 7.2 percent of all attacked computers are part of ICS, researchers said.Manuscrypt, aka NukeSped, is a family of malware tools that have been used in espionage campaigns in the past. One such was a February spear-phishing campaign linked to Lazarus \u2013 a prolific North Korean APT \u2013 that used the Manuscrypt malware family\u2019s \u2018ThreatNeedle\u2019 tool cluster to attack defense companies.Fake Pirated InstallersThe operators behind PseudoManuscrypt are using fake pirated software installer archives to initially download the spyware onto targets\u2019 systems.The fake installers are for for \u201cICS-specific software, such as an application designed to create a MODBUS Master Device to receive data from a PLC [programmable logic controller], as well as more general-purpose software, which is nevertheless used on OT networks, such as a key generator for a SolarWinds tool for network engineers and systems administrators,\u201d researchers said.They suspect that the threat actors are getting the fake installers off a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) platform that\u2019s offering them up to operators of multiple malicious campaigns, not just this widely dispersed PseudoManuscrypt campaign.However, Kaspersky also shared a screen capture \u2013 shown below \u2013of the listings for fake installers they found via a Google search.Fake installers found via a Google search. Source: Kaspersky.Kaspersky outlined two variants of the module, both of which are outfitted with advanced spyware capabilities. One version rode in via the infamous Glupteba botnet: a hard-to-scrub-off, 1 million-strong botnet of compromised Windows and internet of things (IoT) devices that Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group (TAG) disrupted earlier this month.The tie-in with Glupteba is a clue that PseudoManuscrypt\u2019s could have originated on a MaaS platform, researchers said, given that the botnet\u2019s main installer \u201cis also distributed via the pirated software installer distribution platform.\u201dShanghaing Systems with Full Spyware CapabilitiesBoth of the module variants have brawny spyware capabilities, researchers said. PseudoManuscrypt\u2019s main module has a full tool kit for spying every which way, including, among many other things, the ability to:Steal VPN connection dataLog keystrokesGrab screenshots and take screen videosUse a system\u2019s microphone to eavesdrop and record soundFilch clipboard dataSteal OS event log data \u2013 which also makes it possible to steal Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) authentication data.In other words, it can completely take over infected systems, researchers said: \u201cEssentially, the functionality of PseudoManuscrypt provides the attackers with virtually full control of the infected system.\u201dIs This an APT On a Bender?For an APT, this one\u2019s weirdly promiscuous, what with those 35,000 attacks on systems across the globe: a spread that doesn\u2019t indicate that it\u2019s targeted. \u201cSuch a large number of attacked systems is not characteristic of the Lazarus group or APT attacks as a whole,\u201d researchers noted.The PseudoManuscrypt campaign attacks what they called \u201ca significant number of industrial and government organizations, including enterprises in the military-industrial complex and research laboratories.\u201dSimilarities to ManuscryptKasperskiy\u2019s ICS-CERT team first detected the PseudoManuscrypt series of attacks in June, when the malware triggered antivirus detection designed to spot Lazarus activity. The full picture didn\u2019t point to Lazarus, however, given the atypical, untargeted splatter of tens of thousands of attacks.However, Kaspersky subsequently found similarities between the new PseudoManuscrypt and Lazarus\u2019s Manuscrypt malwareThe PseudoManuscrypt malware loads its payload from the system registry and decrypts it, researchers explained, with the payload using a registry location that\u2019s unique to each infected system.\u201cBoth malicious programs load a payload from the system registry and decrypt it; in both cases, a special value in the CLSID format is used to determine the payload\u2019s location in the registry,\u201d they said. \u201cThe executable files of both malicious programs have virtually identical export tables.\u201dComparison of PseudoManuscrypt and Manuscrypt export tables. Source: Kaspersky.The two malwares also use similar executable file naming formats.Executable file names. Source: Kaspersky.Another commonality between the two malwares is that some of the organizations attacked by PseudoManuscrypt have business and production ties with victims of the Lazarus ThreatNeedle campaign, Kaspersky noted.With regards to the geographic reach of the PseudoManuscrypt campaign, nearly a third \u2013 29.4 percent \u2013 of the targeted, non-ICS computers are located in Russia (10.1 percent), India (10 percent) and Brazil (9.3 percent), Kaspersky found, which is a distribution that\u2019s similar to that for ICS computers.\u201cThe number of attacked systems is large and we see no clear focus on specific industrial organizations,\u201d they concluded. \u201cHowever, the fact that a large number of ICS computers across the globe (many hundreds according to our telemetry alone \u2013 and in reality very likely to be much more) have been attacked in this campaign certainly makes it a threat that merits the very closest attention of specialists responsible for the security and safety of shop-floor systems and their continuous operation.\u201dWho\u2019s Behind PseudoManuscrypt?Researchers listed these clues as to the adversary\u2019s origin or its ties:Some malware samples contain comments in Chinese in executable file metadata.Data is sent to the attackers\u2019 server using a library that has previously been used only in malware of the Chinese group APT41.When connecting to the command-and-control server, the malware specifies Chinese as the preferred language.The malicious file contains code for connecting to Baidu, a popular Chinese cloud storage for files.The time of day at which new versions of the PseudoManuscrypt loader were uploaded by the developer falls within the 11 am to 7 pm interval in the GMT+8 time zone, in which several East Asian and Asia-Pacific countries are located.Execution FlowIn a detailed drilldown on its ICS-CERT website, Kaspersky researchers said that the execution flow for PseudoManuscrypt installation has numerous possible variants, with malware installers downloading and executing loads of other malicious programs, including spyware, backdoors, cryptocurrency miners and adware.As well, at each stage, they saw a slew of different droppers installed and modules downloaded, with different modules designed to steal data and each module having its own command-and-control (C2) server.Below is the execution flow for one of the two variants spotted by Kaspersky: the one that uses the Glupteba botnet\u2019s infrastructure and malware installers.Execution flow for the variant that uses the Glupteba infrastructure and malware installers.

        "raw text": "An unknown assailant planted NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware on the iPhones of at least nine U.S. State Department employees, according to four of Reuters\u2019 sources who are familiar with the matter.Two of the sources said that the attacks took place over the last several months, hitting targets either based in Uganda or focused on matters concerning the East African country, the news service reported on Friday.We want to know what your biggest cloud security concerns and challenges are, and how your company is dealing with them. Weigh in with our exclusive, anonymous Threatpost Poll!The Israeli spyware company has repeatedly said that its surveillance tools don\u2019t work against smartphones based in the United States, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily protect Americans traveling overseas or using foreign phones. Two of Reuters\u2019 sources said that the targeted State Department employees were using iPhones registered with foreign telephone numbers, without the U.S. country code.An investigation conducted by the Washington Post along with 16 other news organizations and published in July found that Pegasus had been planted on the phones of journalists and activists worldwide. The United States was no exception: Documented surveillance targets included overseas phone numbers for about a dozen Americans, including journalists, aid workers, diplomats and others, the news organizations ascertained.One such U.S. target is New York Times journalist Ben Hubbard: As cybersecurity watchdog and spyware-scrutinzer Citizen Lab has concluded, Hubbard was \u201crepeatedly targeted with NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware over a three-year period from June 2018 to June 2021,\u201d while he was reporting on Saudi Arabia and writing a book about Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Potentially state-sponsored mobile cyberattacks have included the reported hack of Jeff Bezos\u2019 phone, which reports say occurred after the Amazon CEO opened a seemingly benign WhatsApp video in 2018 from the account of the Saudi Crown Prince. Similarly, Hubbard has said that someone tried to hack his phone by sending him an Arabic text message with a link for a website. Beyond these high-profile instances, various journalists and human rights activists were targeted globally after a WhatsApp zero-day vulnerability was exploited by attackers who were able to inject spyware onto victims\u2019 phones.Apple Alerts State Department VictimsApple sends threat notifications to surveillance targets, including one it sent last month to Ugandan President of the Democratic Party Norbert Mao. Mao shared the notification on Twitter:\u201cWhen you wake up to a threat notification from @Apple that your iPhone is being targeted then you know that cyber terrorism from state sponsored cyber terrorists is real.\u201d \u2014@norbertmaoWhen you wake up to a threat notification from @Apple that your iPhone is being targeted then you know that cyber terrorism from state sponsored cyber terrorists is real. pic.twitter.com/1uZ9eIf1FR\u2014 Norbert Mao (@norbertmao) November 24, 2021Apple declined to comment, but a spokesperson pointed Threatpost to the company\u2019s announcement last week that it was suing NSO Group \u201cto curb the abuse of state-sponsored spyware.\u201dOn the same day that it announced its lawsuit, Apple also said that it would notify what it called the \u201csmall number\u201d of users that it discovered may have been targeted by FORCEDENTRY.FORCEDENTRY is a zero-day exploit successfully deployed against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.6 that blew by Apple\u2019s BlastDoor sandboxing feature to install spyware on the iPhones of Bahraini activists, including one who was living in London at the time.Reuters\u2019 sources said that in this case with the State Department, Apple notified victims that included U.S. citizens who were \u201ceasily identifiable as U.S. government employees,\u201d given that the email addresses associated with their Apple IDs ended in \u201cstate.gov.\u201dMobile Threat Is \u2018Very Real\u2019J.T. Keating, senior vice president of marketing for mobile security provider Zimperium, said in a Monday post that the incident \u201cshould be treated as a wake-up call rather than an isolated attack.\u201d\u201cWe have been detecting and stopping attacks like Pegasus for over ten years,\u201d he wrote.The mobile threat is \u201cvery real,\u201d he said, regardless of how sophisticated the targeted organization or how much faith they put in protections. \u201cEven the most sophisticated organizations are successfully attacked on mobile devices. If the U.S. State Department can be compromised, any organization can be.\u201dKeating referred to a customer panel Zimperium hosted at a recent Gartner Security & Risk Summit in which \u201cEvery customer reiterated that mobile attacks are real and increasing. Then we had our customer advisory meeting and the attendees stated the same thing.\u201dOn Monday, a State Department spokesperson told Threatpost that it\u2019s unable to confirm the attack on State Department employees\u2019 phones.The spokesperson did, however, refer to the addition of NSO Group and Candiru to the country\u2019s Entity List last month, based on evidence that the companies developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used the tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists and academics.At the time, NSO Group said that it would fight the trade ban, clinging to its oft-repeated mantra that its tools actually help to prevent terrorism and crime.Threatpost has also contacted NSO Group itself, the National Security Council (NSC) and the Uganda embassy in Washington, but they didn\u2019t immediately reply.On Thursday, NSO Group told Reuters that it hasn\u2019t found evidence that its tools were used against State Department employees, but that it\u2019s canceled access for its relevant customers. The company is planning to investigate based on Reuters\u2019 findings, NSO Group said in a statement:\u201cIf our investigation shall show these actions indeed happened with NSO\u2019s tools, such customer will be terminated permanently and legal actions will take place\u2026 [NSO Group will] cooperate with any relevant government authority and present the full information we will have.\u201d \u2014NSO Group spokesperson, as quoted by Reuters.How Were the iPhones Infected?Chris Risley, CEO at Bastille Networks, told Threatpost via email on Sunday evening that what\u2019s striking about this story is that \u201c[at least nine] phones were compromised at once.\u201dEither that many employees \u201cwere tricked into clicking on the wrong link, or more likely, the spyware was installed using \u2018zero-click\u2019 attacks,\u201d Risley said.There\u2019s a lesson to be learned about how many vulnerable smartphones enter workplaces daily, and how much risk that entails, he said: \u201cAny smartphone can now be hacked invisibly. A hacked smartphone can be used as a portal into an enterprise\u2019s most important secrets, earnings data, trading data, merger and acquisition data.\u201dIt\u2019s a \u201d new world of smartphone spyware.\u201d he continued, making it \u201cimperative to have security protocols in place to manage the secure use of smartphones in the workplace. If security teams didn\u2019t think smartphones in the facility were an important threat yesterday, they certainly should think they are an important threat now.\u201dRisley imagined that there are \u201cprobably some rooms in the U.S. Embassy in Uganda where no cell phones were allowed.\u201d Hopefully, those are the only rooms where classified conversations took place, he said.If embassies don\u2019t have phone-free rooms, they should set them up \u201cimmediately,\u201d he said. As well, organizations should be aware that turning off phones isn\u2019t enough to ensure that spyware can\u2019t be used to spy on targets, given that spyware can turn phones on.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "In the wake of a zero-click zero-day exploit that was deployed against iPhone users, Apple has filed a lawsuit against NSO Group.The complaint alleges that the maker of the infamous Pegasus mobile spyware is responsible for the illegal surveillance of Apple users. The computing giant is looking for the court to issue a permanent injunction on the Israeli company, banning it from using any Apple software, services or devices \u2013 and also an unspecified amount in monetary damages.\u201cIn a free society, it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,\u201d said Ivan Krsti\u0107, head of apple security engineering and architecture, in an Apple statement, issued Monday.NSO Group is also facing other lawsuits \u2013 notably a complaint brought by Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp that aimed to hold NSO Group accountable for distributing Pegasus via the messaging service to at least 1,400 targets. That suit has sparked legions of amicus briefs from Cisco, Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), GitHub, Google, the Internet Association, LinkedIn, Microsoft and VMware, among others.Earlier this month, a U.S. appeals court rejected NSO Group\u2019s argument that it\u2019s protected from the suit under sovereign immunity laws, which will allow the suit to move forward and which will make it necessary for the company to respond to discovery efforts. That verdict likely acted as a green light for Apple\u2019s decision to file its own suit, researchers noted.\u201c[The Apple suit] isn\u2019t particularly surprising considering that NSO just recently lost their legal bid for a defense of sovereign immunity,\u201d Jake Williams, co-founder and CTO at BreachQuest, said via email. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that Apple has been considering this move for some time, but was waiting for the WhatsApp case to make its way through the federal appeals court.\u201dIn addition to the permanent injunction, the lawsuit also seeks redress for NSO Group\u2019s \u201cflagrant violations of U.S. federal and state law, arising out of its efforts to target and attack Apple and its users.\u201d Apple said that it will be donating any awarded damages to \u201corganizations pursuing cybersurveillance research and advocacy,\u201d along with an additional $10 million from its corporate coffers.Apple also said that it will support Pegasus specialists Citizen Lab with pro-bono technical, threat intelligence and engineering assistance going forward.Pegasus Takes FlightPegasus is a notorious, military-grade\u00a0tool for surveillance\u00a0that\u2019s been linked to highly targeted cyberattacks by repressive regimes against dissidents, activists and NGOs (not to mention the\u00a0murders\u00a0of\u00a0journalists). It can access the microphone, camera, messages and other sensitive data on Apple and Android devices.NSO Group, for its part, maintains that it sells Pegasus only for legitimate law-enforcement and anti-terrorist activities, to vetted governments that uphold civil rights. That\u2019s a claim that researchers have largely rejected, including in a recent analysis\u00a0from Amnesty International and Citizen Lab.The U.S. government has also pushed back on that notion of innocence, earlier this month banning any trade with the company by American citizens or organizations. The U.S. Commerce Department added NSO Group its \u201cEntity List,\u201d which was previously mainly used to limit the flow of money to people and organizations with links to kinetic terror activities.Pegasus Took a Bite of AppleApple has a legitimate beef: NSO Group has not hesitated to target Apple users in the past. In August, cybersecurity watchdog Citizen Lab warned that Pegasus had added a zero-click, zero-day Apple exploit dubbed FORCEDENTRY to its bag of tricks. The spyware was seen successfully deploying against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.6, blowing past Apple\u2019s new BlastDoor sandboxing feature to land on the iPhones of Bahraini activists. Apple rushed an emergency fix for the bug.And, last December, four nation-state-backed advanced persistent threats (APTs) hacked Al Jazeera journalists, producers, anchors and executives, in a Pegasus espionage attack leveraging another zero-day exploit for Apple iPhone, researchers said.\u201cState-sponsored actors like the NSO Group spend millions of dollars on sophisticated surveillance technologies without effective accountability. That needs to change,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, in the statement. \u201cApple devices are the most secure consumer hardware on the market \u2014 but private companies developing state-sponsored spyware have become even more dangerous. While these cybersecurity threats only impact a very small number of our customers, we take any attack on our users very seriously, and we\u2019re constantly working to strengthen the security and privacy protections in iOS to keep all our users safe.\u201dApple\u2019s legal complaint provides new information on FORCEDENTRY, Apple noted: \u201cTo deliver FORCEDENTRY to Apple devices, attackers created Apple IDs to send malicious data to a victim\u2019s device \u2014 allowing NSO Group or its clients to deliver and install Pegasus spyware without a victim\u2019s knowledge.\u201dResearchers React to Apple\u2019s NSO LawsuitCybersecurity researchers, for their part, applauded Apple\u2019s move. Joseph Carson for instance, chief security scientist and advisory CISO at ThycoticCentrify, touted it as a win for privacy.\u201cGovernments and others have been known to use and abuse the Pegasus spyware to gain access to mobile devices data without the victim knowing or needing to click on anything,\u201d he said via email. \u201cTo protect privacy means the need to have good security. When security is broken, it puts everyone at risk.\u00a0 The balance of privacy is at risk more than ever before and it looks like Apple has decided to defend and fight for privacy.\u00a0 It is important to protect citizens as governments are here to serve and provide services for the citizens, not to control. This means governments must work together to limit safe havens for those who abuse citizens\u2019 rights and when diplomacy fails, it looks like Apple are now taking the legal action path.\u201dBreachQuest\u2019s Williams noted that even if NSO Group\u2019s targeting of the Apple platform can\u2019t be prevented with any technical measures, the suit adds to the already formidable headwinds that the company faces.\u201cObviously NSO will be able to bypass this from a technical standpoint,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, it likely gives Apple additional legal recourse if NSO continues to offer exploits and backdoors that clearly rely on access to Apple products and services for engineering and testing. This can\u2019t be good news for NSO, which is reportedly in danger of default with over $500 million in debt, a recent leadership shakeup with their CEO, and France pulling out of a planned purchase after the U.S. sanctions.\u201dJohn Bambenek, principal threat hunter at Netenrich, said that NSO Group has simply pushed it too far.\u201cThis is the natural consequence of the weaponization of vulnerabilities against large enterprises and their customers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn years back, these legal tools were used against security researchers until the d\u00e9tente of bug-bounty programs was reached. NSO Group and others are simply now on the business end of these legal tools that have existed but have been dormant for some time. And while I\u2019m skeptical of near-monopolies, [Apple and others] nonetheless have access to court systems all over the world to fight back hard against these entities and I\u2019m glad that they are doing so.There\u2019s a sea of unstructured data on the internet relating to the latest security threats.

        "raw text": "Researchers discovered new Android spyware that provides similar capabilities to NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus controversial software. Called PhoneSpy, the mobile surveillance-ware has been spotted activity targeting South Koreans without their knowledge.PhoneSpy disguises itself as a legitimate application and gives attackers complete access to data stored on a mobile device and grants full control over the targeted device, according to a Zimperium zLabs report published Wednesday.Pegasus spyware, developed by Israeli-based NSO Group, which has been blacklisted by the U.S. government, has been linked to cyberattacks against dissidents, activists and NGO workers. However, it\u2019s unclear from the Zimperium report who is behind PhoneSpy and whether it is being sold commercially. Also unclear from the report is whether high-profile victims or random individuals are being targeted by PhoneSpy.According to Zimperium, attackers are weaponizing PhoneSpy for similar purposes as the NSO Group did. However, researchers conceded they are unsure why thousands in South Korea are targeted or what connection they have to each other.Hiding in Plain SightThe spyware is potentially more dangerous than Pegasus, researchers assert. They argue that PhoneSpy \u201chides in plain sight, disguising itself as a regular application with purposes ranging from learning yoga to watching TV and videos, or browsing photos,\u201d Zimperium researcher Aazim Yaswant wrote in the post.PhoneSpy features include stealing data, eavesdropping on messages and viewing images stored on the phone. Researchers said attackers can also gain full remote control of Android phones. So far, Yaswant wrote, Zimperium has identified 23 applications surreptitiously containing the spyware.Click to register for our LIVE event!\u201cThese malicious Android apps are designed to run silently in the background, constantly spying on their victims without raising any suspicion,\u201d Yaswant wrote. \u201cWe believe the malicious actors responsible for PhoneSpy have gathered significant amounts of personal and corporate information on their victims, including private communications and photos.\u201dAnother reason for concern over PhoneSpy\u2019s appearance is it is written with off-the-shelf code, showing that spyware on par with Pegasus is not just limited to organized and sophisticated companies such as NSO. It also means it\u2019s easier for the cybercriminals behind the spyware to cover their tracks, as the spyware doesn\u2019t carry specific fingerprints of a certain organization, Yaswant wrote.Specific CapabilitiesSo far researchers have found PhoneSpy\u2014which disguises itself as various lifestyle apps\u2013targeting only Android users in South Korea, they said. Since it hasn\u2019t been sighted on Google\u2019s official app store or other third-party Android app stores, Yaswant surmised PhoneSpy is being distributed via social engineering tactics as opposed to delivery via a zero-day vulnerability.Once installed, the spyware treads a typical path for malware of its type. It first requests permissions and opens a phishing page that imitates the login page of the popular South Korean messaging app \u201cKakao Talk\u201d to steal credentials, Yaswant explained. This info can then be used to login into other services in South Korea with a single-sign-on feature, he said.Meanwhile, in the background, the spyware acts like a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), abusing permissions to exfiltrate data to a command-and-control server and leaving the device open to access for the threat actors, researchers found.In addition to stealing data, other capabilities of PhoneSpy include recording or live-streaming video or audio; viewing SMS messages (such as two-factor authentication messages); sending SMS messages as the device\u2019s owner; editing contact info in the device\u2019s address book; enabling call forwarding; and viewing the GPS location of the device.PhoneSpy also can install or uninstall any of the apps on the device, including security apps, thus giving itself an additional way to avoid detection, Yaswant wrote.Want to win back control of the flimsy passwords standing between your network and the next cyberattack?

        "raw text": "NSO Group \u2013 the Israeli-based maker of the notorious, military-grade Pegasus spyware that\u2019s been linked to cyberattacks against dissidents, activists and NGOs (and murders of journalists) at the hands of repressive regimes \u2013 has been blacklisted by the United States.NSO Group is one of four spyware developers or traffickers that the U.S. Commerce Department added to its \u201cEntity List\u201d on Wednesday, effectively banning trade with the company. The list is used to restrict those deemed to pose a risk to the country\u2019s national security or foreign policy.Also added was fellow Israeli company Candiru \u2013 aka Sourgum, Grindavik, Saito Tech or Taveta \u2013 which allegedly sells the DevilsTongue surveillance malware to governments around the world and which was founded by engineers who left NSO.The State Department said that both NSO Group and Candiru were added because they \u201cdeveloped and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used this tool to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics and embassy workers.\u201dThe third entity added to the trade-ban was Russia\u2019s Positive Technologies, which was sanctioned in April for its work with Russian intelligence.And finally, also blacklisted was the Singaporean security company Computer Security Initiative Consultancy (COSEINC), which the State Department said was added to the list for trafficking in malicious cyber-tools \u201cused to gain unauthorized access to information systems in ways that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy of the United States, threatening the privacy and security of individuals and organizations worldwide.\u201dCompanies placed on the Entity List are subject to trading restrictions: They can\u2019t purchase U.S. technology or goods without explicit permission from the Commerce Department, which they aren\u2019t likely to secure, since the rules don\u2019t allow license exceptions for exports.NSO\u2019s Non-Winning Business PlanNSO Group\u2019s blacklisting is likely the least surprising of the four new Entity List entries, given the history of its spyware repeatedly being used to target civil society and government officials.But it\u2019s not just the targeting that got NSO banned. Jake Williams, co-founder and CTO at incident response firm BreachQuest, conjectured that it\u2019s the fact that NSO\u2019s tools have allegedly been used to go after targets the U.S. likes.\u201cIt isn\u2019t just the targeting of these individuals that got NSO in hot water, it\u2019s that entities unfriendly to the U.S. used NSO tools to target friendly journalists, activists, etc. That\u2019s never a winning business plan,\u201d he told Threatpost.It\u2019s not surprising to see Positive Technologies on the list either, Williams commented. The addition of COSEINC is the most surprising, he said, given that for the most part, it\u2019s flown under the public radar until now, though it was identified as a zero-day vendor in 2018.NSO Says It\u2019s \u2018Dismayed\u2019According to a statement that NSO\u00a0 sent to media outlets on Wednesday and eventually to Threatpost on Friday, the company was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the U.S. decision and claimed that its tools actually help to prevent terrorism and crime.It\u2019s going to call for the United States to reverse the ban, NSO said, sticking to its oft-repeated claim that it has the \u201cworld\u2019s most rigorous\u201d human rights and compliance systems. The full statement:NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed. We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world\u2019s most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based [on] the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products.As the New York Times reported, regardless of NSO Group\u2019s claims, its spyware keeps appearing \u201con the phones of journalists, critics of autocratic regimes, even children. Some of NSO\u2019s targets \u2014 like Ahmed Mansoor, a critic of the United Arab Emirates \u2014 have been imprisoned and held in solitary confinement for years after NSO\u2019s spyware was found on their phones.\u201dThe ban marks a first: The Entity List hasn\u2019t historically included technology companies. Rather, the blacklist is typically reserved for abusers of human rights or others that the U.S. thinks deserve the rating of \u201cworst enemy.\u201dSo far this year, the Biden administration has added Myanmar entities in response to the country\u2019s military coup as well as entities in Russia, Switzerland and Germany. China and Venezuela are also included in the list.The addition of the tech companies to the list reveals the United State\u2019s sharpened concern with spyware as it relates to national security. It\u2019s apparently right to be concerned: Besides all of the journalists and activists who\u2019ve allegedly been surveilled by foreign governments using NSO\u2019s spyware, the mobile phone of a senior U.S. diplomat, Robert Malley, was also found on a leaked list of individuals selected as potential targets of surveillance by NSO\u2019s clients, as The Guardian has reported. So too was a list of French officials that reached all the way up to President Emmanuel Macron.\u2018Hitting Puddles With Sledgehammers\u2019Bill Lawrence, CISO of the risk-management acceleration platform vendor SecurityGate, said that the ban on spyware will put some economic hurt on the blacklisted companies, but such economic measures can feel \u201clike hitting puddles with sledgehammers\u201d as they reform in other ways.Oliver Tavakoli, CTO at cybersecurity company Vectra AI, agreed, telling Threatpost that these sanctions, for the most part, represent \u201ca speed bump\u201d for the surveillance companies.Meanwhile, contracts have language that can be flexibly interpreted when it comes to what constitutes \u201cappropriate use\u201d of such tools, Tavakoli said.\u201cThe murky business of supplying offensive cyber-capabilities to governments across the world invariably leads these companies to make a judgment on what constitutes \u2018appropriate use\u2019 of the technologies and whether their clients can be trusted to honor the spirit of constraints \u2013 often expressed in vague terms referring to \u2018threats\u2019 and \u2018security\u2019 \u2013 written into contracts,\u201d he said via email.Tavakoli continued: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that most governments ignore those constraints and do what they believe to be in the self-interest of the government and its current leader, though the companies can then claim plausible deniability.\u201dThe ban, while being a good step, would be even better if the U.S. would itself stop \u201ctrying to get \u2018back doors\u2019 installed in its own citizens\u2019 electronics,\u201d Lawrence told Threatpost on Thursday via email. One example jumps out: the FBI\u2019s repeated attempts to compel Apple to install backdoors.Cybersecurity for multi-cloud environments is notoriously challenging.

        "raw text": "A never-before-seen, zero-click iMessaging exploit has been allegedly used to illegally spy on Bahraini activists with NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware, according to cybersecurity watchdog Citizen Lab.The digital researchers are calling the new iMessaging exploit FORCEDENTRY.In a report published on Tuesday, researchers said that they\u2019ve identified nine Bahraini activists whose iPhones were inflicted with Pegasus spyware between June 2020 and February 2021. Some of the activists\u2019 phones suffered zero-click iMessage attacks that, besides FORCEDENTRY, also included the 2020 KISMET exploit.The activists included three members of Waad (a secular Bahraini political society), three members of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, two exiled Bahraini dissidents, and one member of Al Wefaq (a Shiite Bahraini political society), Citizen Lab wrote.At least one of the activists lived in London when the exploit was unleashed, Citizen Lab said. That\u2019s a new twist, given that researchers have only seen the Bahraini government spying in Bahrain and Qatar, never in Europe. It could mean that the activist in London \u201cmay have been hacked by a Pegasus operator associated with a different government.\u201d Citizen Lab suggested.At least four of the targets were attacked by LULU: a Pegasus operator that Citizen Lab attributes with \u201chigh confidence\u201d to the Bahraini government, which has a history of using commercially available spyware.One of the activists was targeted in 2020 several hours after they revealed during an interview that their phone was infected with Pegasus in 2019.New iPhone Zero-Click Exploit Popped Up in FebruaryCitizen Lab first observed NSO Group deploying the new zero-click FORCEDENTRY iMessage exploit \u2013 which circumvents Apple\u2019s BlastDoor feature \u2013 in February 2021. Apple had just introduced BlastDoor, a structural improvement in iOS 14 meant to block message-based, zero-click exploits like this \u2013 the month before. BlastDoor was supposed to prevent this type of Pegasus attack by acting as what Google Project Zero\u2019s Samuel Gro\u00df called a \u201ctightly sandboxed\u201d service responsible for \u201calmost all\u201d of the parsing of untrusted data in iMessages.So much for all that. \u201cWe saw the FORCEDENTRY exploit successfully deployed against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.6 as a zero-day,\u201d Citizen Lab said. \u201cWith the consent of targets, we shared these crash logs and some additional phone logs relating to KISMET and FORCEDENTRY with Apple, Inc., which confirmed they were investigating.\u201dApple RespondsIvan Krsti\u0107, head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, told Threatpost on Tuesday that attacks such as the ones described by Citizen Lab are highly targeted and thus nothing to worry about \u2026 for most people, at any rate. In a statement, Krsti\u0107 said that such attacks are \u201chighly sophisticated, cost millions of dollars to develop, often have a short shelf life, and are used to target specific individuals.\u201dAs such, they\u2019re \u201cnot a threat to the overwhelming majority of our users,\u201d Krsti\u0107 wrote, although Apple continues to \u201ctry to protect all of its customers and is constantly adding new protections for their devices and data.\u201dAnother Apple spokesperson noted to Threatpost that BlastDoor isn\u2019t the end-all, be-all when it comes to securing iMessage, that Apple has significantly boosted defenses in iOS 15 and will continue to do so. Security is, after all, a dynamic process, and Apple is constantly working to respond to new threats as they emerge, the spokesperson said.What to Do If You\u2019re Not \u2018Most People\u2019Besides Apple\u2019s iMessage, NSO Group has a track record of exploiting other messaging apps, such as WhatsApp, in order to deliver its malware. Still, Citizen Lab thinks that in this particular case, with these particular attacks, disabling iMessage and FaceTime might have thwarted the threat actors. \u201cDisabling iMessage and FaceTime would not offer complete protection from zero-click attacks or spyware,\u201d researchers noted.Plus, it has tradeoffs: \u201cDisabling iMessage means that messages exchanged via Apple\u2019s built-in Messages app would be sent unencrypted (i.e., \u2018green messages\u2019 instead of \u2018blue messages\u2019), making them trivial for an attacker to intercept,\u201d according to the report.Of course, there are other end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to consider when it comes to minimizing your attack surface. Taylor Gulley, senior application security consultant at app security provider nVisium, told Threatpost on Tuesday that disabling widely used methods of communication can at least force attackers to jump through more hoops, given that it forces them \u201cto invest more time and effort into discovering new exploits for the avenues that remain.\u201dTo minimize attack surface via messaging, that means limiting the number of messaging apps installed, only accepting messages from known contacts, and preventing those messages received from automatically fetching media, Gulley noted. \u201cAll of these act as additional barriers between you and a malicious message.\u201dGulley pointed out that there have been a number of vulnerabilities in recent years for both iOS and Android messaging apps.Hank Schless, senior manager of security solutions at endpoint-to-cloud security company Lookout, noted that there\u2019s an Android version of Pegasus known as Chrysaor, uncovered in 2017 by Lookout and Google. It has almost the exact same capabilities on Android as Pegasus does on iOS, Schless said, including gaining root access to the target device and being able to read anything on the device even if it\u2019s in an app with encrypted messaging.Chrysaor differs from Pegasus in that it doesn\u2019t rely on zero-day vulnerabilities in order to infect the device, Schless said in an email. Rather, it relies on a well-known rooting technique called Framaroot.Still, the attack chains of both Pegasus and Chrysaor are the same: \u201cThe attacker sends the targeted individual a socially engineered message across any platform with messaging capabilities and silently delivers the vicious surveillanceware to the device,\u201d he described. \u201cUnfortunately, this means that targets are at risk regardless of the OS their device runs on. It also means that almost no data is safe, since root access to a device gives the attacker control and access to everything.\u201dAn attempted jailbreak or root of a device is one of the biggest signs of malware being present on the device, Schless said. Admins of mobile apps \u2013 including Lookout \u2013 \u201ccan set policies that block a device from the internet and alert the user as soon as that malicious functionality is detected\u201d he noted.A better option than either Android or iOS may be to use an open-source messaging app built from the ground up with security in mind, such as Signal, Gulley said via email. That gives you two fallbacks: \u201cAuditing the code yourself as a user or to some degree, relying on the community to audit it for you.\u201dOpen source apps aren\u2019t necessarily any more secure than proprietary apps, Gulley suggested, but at least they can be independently audited. \u201cDespite their best intentions, securing your data and device is secondary to these companies who \u2014 let\u2019s be honest \u2014 are ultimately there to make money off ads, devices, and services,\u201d the consultant observed. \u201cIf these kinds of zero-day flaws were easy to discover, they would be less likely to have been created in the first place. This is evident by the fact that numerous open- and closed-source apps have been exploited by zero-day attacks \u2014 an unfortunate reality that will continue well into the future.\u201dNSO Group Sort of RespondsNSO Group said in a statement given to Bloomberg that it hadn\u2019t yet seen the report, but nonetheless, the company questions Citizen Lab\u2019s methods and motives. \u201cIf NSO receives reliable information related to the misuse of the system, the company will vigorously investigate the claims and act accordingly,\u201d according to its statement.Threatpost reached out to NSO Group with a number of questions, the first being whether or not anybody at the Israeli company has gotten around to reading Citizen Lab\u2019s report yet. We also asked NSO Group to explain what specific questions it has about Citizen Lab\u2019s \u201cmethods and motives;\u201d what source, and the nature of the information, that it would consider reliable; example(s) of when NSO Group has launched an investigation into misuse of its technology; and what the outcome has been.An NSO Group spokesperson said that these questions are addressed in the company\u2019s Transparency and Responsibility Report (PDF), which claims that since 2016, it\u2019s cut off five customers following an investigation of misuse. The pamphlet doesn\u2019t identify the customers.Lookout\u2019s Schless pointed out that ever since Lookout and Citizen Lab first discovered Pegasus back in 2016, NSO has maintained the stance that its spyware is only sold to a handful of intelligence communities within countries that have been thoroughly vetted for human rights violations. \u201cTheir proactive statements about the Citizen Lab is just another attempt at maintaining this narrative in the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThe recent exposure of 50,000 phone numbers linked to targets of NSO Group customers was all people needed to see right through what NSO claims.\u201dSchless called\u00a0 Citizen Lab \u201ca leader in the security research field\u201d that \u201copenly works together with private sector organizations to ensure that the world is made aware of threats across the Internet as a means to stay safer and more secure.\u201dAdd This to the Growing PileAs far as NSO Group\u2019s own methods and motives go, they\u2019re getting beaucoup scrutiny in the courts and in protests by infuriated citizens and lawmakers around the world. It\u2019s on the hot seat in these cases:Budapest: Last month, about 1,000 people protested and Hungary\u2019s opposition called for ministerial resignations from Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s far-right government over allegations that it secretly, illegally surveilled journalists, media owners and opposition political figures with Pegasus.India: Also in July, protests erupted in India\u2019s parliament, with the opposition party calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government\u2019s alleged use of NSO Group\u2019s military-grade Pegasus to spy on political opponents and others \u201ca national security threat.\u201dFrance: Last month, French President Emmanuel Macon switched his phone and number after reports that he, along with 14 French ministers, were allegedly flagged for potential Pegasus surveillance by Morocco. French lawmakers launched an investigation into the allegations.California: Facebook\u2019s suing NSO Group in U.S. federal court over alleged spying on WhatsApp users. In December 2020, a roster of tech companies filed amicus briefs in support of its legal action, including Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and VMWare.United Nations: Also in July, the UN human rights chief decried the widespread use of Pegasus to illegally undermine the rights of those under surveillance, including journalists and politicians, calling it \u201cextremely alarming\u201d and saying that it confirmed \u201csome of the worst fears\u201d surrounding the potential misuse of such technology. Human rights experts working with the UN called for a moratorium on the sale and transfer of spyware and other surveillance technology until they\u2019ve instituted \u201crobust regulations that guarantee its use in compliance with international human rights standards.\u201dAmnesty International: The human rights group has accused Saudi Arabia of using Pegasus to spy on its employees. In 2019, Amnesty announced that it was taking the Israeli Ministry of Defense (MoD) to court to force it to revoke NSO Group\u2019s export license.Check out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentHacksMalwareVulnerabilitiesWeb Security",

        "raw text": "French lawmakers have launched an investigation into Israeli offensive cybersecurity company NSO Group after they learned French President Emmanuel Macron topped a list of 14 heads of states potentially targeted by the company\u2019s spyware.Amnesty International said Tuesday the French leader was a potential spyware target, along with presidents Imran Khan of Pakistan, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa and Barham Salih of Iraq. Heads of state, including the prime ministers and the king of Morocco, Mohammed VI, were also high-profile potential targets of NSO\u2019s software known as Pegasus.\u201cThe unprecedented revelation \u2026 should send a chill down the spine of world leaders,\u201d wrote Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general, in a statement.\nThe world leaders were potential targets, according to a list of 50,000 phone numbers believed linked to the NSO Group and leaked to Amnesty International and the Paris-based journalism nonprofit Forbidden Stories. The extensive list is believed to date back to 2016 and includes people of interest by clients of NSO.On Sunday, a consortium of 17 media partners published a bombshell report shedding light onto what they believe is a systemic and widespread use of the Pegasus spyware by sometimes repressive regimes against human rights activists, political dissidents, journalists and religious and world leaders.French Outraged French daily Le Monde, said after it launched its own investigation into the NSO leaked data, it determined that 15 members of the French government may have been among potential targets, along with Macron.On Wednesday, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed to the Associated Press it was investigating the suspected widespread use of NSO\u2019s Pegasus spyware on French politicians. The Washington Post also reported that France\u2019s prime minister, Jean Castex, told French lawmakers at the country\u2019s National Assembly that the government had ordered investigations.The Post published a statement by the official residence of the President of the French Republic, \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, stating:\u201cIf the facts are confirmed, they are clearly very serious. All light will be shed on these press revelations. Certain French victims have already announced that they would take legal action, and therefore judicial inquiries will be launched.\u201dNSO Founder Denies AllegationsIn an exclusive interview with publication Calcalist, NSO founder and CEO Shalev Hulio doubled down on its assertion that the list of 50,000 phone numbers, potentially targeted by Pegasus spyware, is bogus.\u201cThis is an engineered list unrelated to us,\u201d Hulio said.A statement by Hulio to Calcalist reads:\u201cAround one month ago we received the first approach from an information broker. He said that there is a list circulating in the market and that whoever holds it is saying that the NSO servers in Cyprus were hacked and that there is a list of targets there and that we should be careful. We looked into it. We don\u2019t have servers in Cyprus and don\u2019t have these types of lists, and the number doesn\u2019t make sense in any way so it has nothing to do with us. He insisted that it does. We were later approached by two different clients who said that brokers have come to them claiming that they have a list related to NSO. We eventually received some screenshots of the list the brokers managed to get a hold of and based on that we understood that this doesn\u2019t look like the Pegasus system, certainly on the server, and that this is an engineered list unrelated to us. We looked over it with the clients and it slowly became clear to us that it is an HLR Lookup server and has nothing to do with NSO. We understood that this was a joke.\u201d Hulio said it works with 45 customers a year who target an average of 100 phones a year. He maintains the list of 50,000 alleged targets has nothing to do with NSO.Still, a forensic analysis of 67 of the phones on the list 50,000 revealed that 37 had traces of Pegasus software. Amnesty International and Forbidden Stories editors emphasized the list of phone numbers does not indicate that all of those phones were targeted with an attack.Tech World Recoils in Disgust News of possible widespread use of the notorious Pegasus mobile spyware from NSO Group has drawn a sharp rebuke by those in the security community. Reactions have been varied, with many voicing concern over the level of security in Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem. According to reports, the NSO Group made use of a zero-click zero-day in Apple\u2019s iMessage feature\u00a0in its Pegasus mobile spyware.Noted Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green suggests Apple could do more to beef up security around its iMessage technology.\u201cThere is good evidence that Apple realizes the bind they\u2019re in, since they\u00a0tried\u00a0to fix iMessage by barricading it behind a specialized \u201cfirewall\u201d called\u00a0BlastDoor. But firewalls haven\u2019t been particularly successful at preventing targeted network attacks, and there\u2019s no reason to think that BlastDoor will do much better. (Indeed, we know it\u2019s probably not doing its job now.),\u201d he wrote in a recent blog post titled \u201cA case against security nihilism\u201c.In a statement to Threatpost, Amazon said it shut down NSO accounts that were \u201cconfirmed to be supporting the reported hacking activity.\u201d Amazon, who was identified in the Pegasus report, said the accounts had violated its terms of use.DigitalOcean, another tech firm that hosted NSO servers, told the Associated Press \u201cAll of the infrastructure outlined in the Amnesty report is no longer on DigitalOcean.\u201dCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentMalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "News of a zero-click zero-day in Apple\u2019s iMessage feature being incorporated into the notorious Pegasus mobile spyware from NSO Group has drawn a variety of reactions from the security community, including concerns about the security of Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem, and varying views on NSO Group\u2019s culpability for how Pegasus is used.Since its initial discovery by Lookout and Citizen Lab in 2016, Pegasus has continued to evolve, making it easier and easier to infect mobile devices, noted Aaron Cockerill, chief strategy officer at Lookout. In fact, this isn\u2019t even the first zero-click zero-day used by the surveillance solution.\u201cIt has advanced to the point of executing on the target\u2019s mobile device without requiring any interaction by the user, which means the operator only has to send the malware to the device,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cConsidering the number of apps iOS and Android devices have with messaging functionality, this could be done through SMS, email, social media, third-party messaging, gaming or dating apps.\u201dThat\u2019s a problem, he said, especially given that as a closed ecosystem, Apple\u2019s code is not as available for review and bug hunting as it could be, he said (though Apple does have a bug-bounty program).\u201cThis means vulnerabilities may remain undiscovered by attackers for longer, but they may also not be so readily discovered and reported by security researchers and other responsible parties,\u201d Cockerill said. \u201cOn top of ensuring the security and integrity of its own software, Apple faces the additional challenge of doing the same for millions of apps developed by third parties and submitted to the App Store.\u201dHe added, \u201cApple aims their statements about security and privacy at consumers. However, the majority of the individuals targeted by the NSO group are not categorized as typical consumers and Apple needs to recognize that securing these individuals may require help from third parties.\u201dOliver Tavakoli, CTO at Vectra, told Threatpost that Apple\u2019s coding practices could be tighter, too.\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the iOS iMessage service is a bit of a mess from a security perspective,\u201d he said. \u201cApple has added more and more functionality to it \u2013 and every piece of functionality comes with the potential for exploitable vulnerabilities.\u201dAlso, the fact that iMessage does not distinguish how it handles inbound messages from known contacts vs. strangers opens phones up to exploitation, he added: \u201cAccepting and processing messages from anyone is the equivalent of running a network connected to the internet with no firewall,\u201d Tavakoli said.Researchers should all pitch in to combat against surveillance misuse, according to Setu Kulkarni, vice president of strategy at NTT Application Security.\u201cThis provides a time for us to get behind Apple and others (including Google) as they up the ante against what was originally intended to be \u2018spyware\u2019 for societal good,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Apple and other manufactures, this is a moment of reckoning to get further entrenched with the governments to create more checks and balances while they make their platform more impenetrable for bad actors.\u201dNSO Group: Misunderstood or Miscreant?As for NSO Group, it maintains that Pegasus serves a legitimate function to help law enforcement and government agencies track down terrorists and bad actors. Researchers speaking to Threatpost largely rejected the notion that it doesn\u2019t sell to repressive regimes for anti-democratic purposes, echoing the results of an analysis from Amnesty International and Citizen Lab making headlines this week.Not everyone Brian Higgins, security specialist at Comparitech, said that the NSO Group does \u201ctheir best to control its deployment contractually,\u201d but noted that it\u2019s hard for the firm to govern how government customers use Pegasus.\u201cThere will always be consumers who will seek to re-purpose its functionality to their own ends,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cThis story is still developing but it is already apparent that the numbers of potential victims quoted do not accurately reflect the amount of malicious activity currently facilitated by this software. It is an unfortunate reality that talented developers can never totally understand the full spectrum of uses their ideas may fulfill in the future.\u201dPaul Bischoff, a privacy advocate at Comparitech and Higgins\u2019 colleague, takes a much harder line on the shadowy Israeli tech firm.\u201cNSO Group has been suspected of selling its spyware to some of the world\u2019s most oppressive governments and leaders,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cAmnesty International and Citizen Labs\u2019 findings further support these suspicions. NSO Group is in effect a weapons dealer, and there\u2019s very few restrictions on to whom it can sell its weapons. Pegasus is used by governments and other authorities to commit crimes, notably against journalists and political opponents. There is no legitimate and legal use for Pegasus\u2026We need to end the commercial market for malware by putting a moratorium on the sale of all hacking tools.\u201dErich Kron, security awareness advocate at KnowBe4, has a similar opinion.\u201cThe issue of surveillance products can become a serious threat based on who the developer decides is worthy of its use,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cWhile the U.S. may feel justified using Pegasus, we may not agree on others that the NSO believes should be allowed the technology.\u00a0 A troubling part of this is the potential targeting of government officials, journalists and even religious leaders. Due to the potential for abuse and the ability to blatantly invade the privacy of so many people while remaining clandestine in its actions, severe restrictions need to apply to its use.\u201dThe stakes are high and getting higher, though as of yet, governmental sources haven\u2019t weighed in on the existence of Pegasus or the bombshell report showing how widespread it is for use against dissidents and others.\u201cNSO Groups\u2019s tactics are yet another example of how tools and techniques that were once the sole purview of nation-states have made their way into the private sector,\u201d Mark Bowling, vice president of security response service at ExtraHop, told Threatpost. \u201cUnlike ransomware syndicates like Darkside or REvil, NSO Group began as a legitimate operation selling commercial software. As this latest reporting makes clear, however, the tactics they employ look a lot like nation-state espionage, and indeed, amount to the privatization of cyber-espionage at a scale not previously seen.\u201dPegasus Mobile Surveillance Ban UnlikelyA ban is much easier said than done, given that many governments want to be able to leverage smartphone spying for their national-security purposes, according to Mike Fong, CEO and founder of Privoro.\u201cAs a result, stopping one company or trying to ban the commercial spyware industry is only a Band-Aid,\u201d he told Threatpost. \u201cMany companies do it and successful bans will simply drive development underground or force governments that aren\u2019t already doing it themselves to develop programs to do so.\u201dNTT\u2019s Kulkarni said that while an outright ban is unlikely, lawmakers can nonetheless create consequences for misuse of what he termed \u201csuch utilities.\u201d\u201cI hope this does not end up in a situation where the measures taken end up taking away an otherwise legitimate tool that law enforcement have to keep society safe,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, for NSO Group, Apple and law agencies, the lesson is that with great power comes great responsibility. It is time to step it up and find a way forward where NSO Group, Apple and law agencies can further improve their collaboration rather than take a step back.\u201dLittle Protection Against SpywareOne thing that researchers agree on is the rising threat of mobile attacks \u2014 and the fact there\u2019s little than can be done to combat zero-click threats that require no user interaction, other than applying patches as they\u2019re rolled out.\u201cIn our modern, tech-surrounded world where we are closely connected to digital devices, it is no surprise that this type of software exists for use by law enforcement or other entities,\u201d KnowBe4\u2019s Kron said. \u201cWe keep our contact lists, emails, text messages and other private digital correspondence in our front pockets and our trust and comfort level with them can make us oblivious to the risks involved in keeping this information secure. No longer do people have to break into your home and into a safe to get sensitive data \u2014 they only need to send a malicious email or convince you to download an infected application.\u201d\u201cThe breadth and depth of phone capabilities and the extensive global supply chains create a huge attack surface,\u201d Fong added. \u201cThe incentive and value of hacking a smartphone is off the charts. People now carry a mic, camera and tracker with them all day long, on top of the data on the phone itself and the communication it enables.\u201dHe added, \u201cboth of these facts equate to dim prospects for the phone ever being secure against sophisticated attackers. We need layered defense and special purpose protection designed from the ground up to fill a limited purpose: security and protection.\u201dCheck out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.\u00a0MalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Pegasus spyware from the Israeli firm NSO Group is nearly invisible. It sends messages to compromise targeted phones without setting off any alarm bells to the phone\u2019s user. There\u2019s little you can do to protect yourself, say experts.But little isn\u2019t nothing.Our guest today is Adam Weinberg, white hat mobile hacker and CTO of FirstPoint Mobile Guard. He joined us on the Threatpost podcast to discuss the news about the use of Pegasus \u2013 the notorious, military-grade spyware sold by the Israeli company NSO Group that\u2019s been linked to cyberattacks and murders of journalists and NGOs \u2013 to surveil citizens.\nAs tracked in an investigation conducted by The Washington Post and 16 media partners, a data leak led the consortium to a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers of activists, journalists, business executives and politicians \u2014 possible iPhone and Android targets of the Pegasus malware.The leaked data from the NSO Group is hinting at widespread Pegasus infections.Early forensics of phones \u2013 representing just a tiny sliver of the handsets tied to the 50,000 phone numbers \u2013 reveal that traces of Pegasus have been found in 37 smartphones belonging to journalists, human rights activists, business executives and two women close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.At least if you live in Israel, where FirstPoint has collaborated with wireless carriers, you have an option to protect your phone from spyware. As far as the rest of us go, there might be some protection in getting a new SIM card, along with service provided by a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO): a reseller for wireless communications services.In this podcast, Weinberg explains how spyware attacks happen and how protection works. His advice can hopefully help\u00a0 journalists, activists, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and companies as they seek to protect themselves from the governments and other cyberattackers that are targeting them with Pegasus-like spyware.Download the podcast here, listen to the episode below, or scroll down to read a lightly edited transcript.\nCheck out our free upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.072121 11:36 UPDATE: Corrected Adam Weinberg\u2019s title. He is CTO.TranscriptWhat follows is a lightly edited transcript of the podcast.Lisa Vaas: Hi. Welcome to the Threatpost podcast. I\u2019m Lisa Vaas. And I\u2019m your host today? Our guest is Adam Weinberg, white hat, mobile hacker, and CEO of first point mobile guard. He is here to chat with us. The shocking news today about Pegasus software and the NS group, and how many phones were affected specifically, Adam is here to tell us how we can protect ourselves from spyware, Adam.Welcome. It\u2019s a pleasure to have you. It\u2019s an honor to have. Thank you. Thank you. So you said that as I understand it, you can explain how media organizations and companies can protect themselves from Pegasus and similar technology. Because as we all know, it\u2019s certainly not the only or spyware out there that can do tremendous damage and leave quite a lot.Victims in its wake, particularly media organizations, human rights, activists and companies. So what are your thoughts on the news today, Adam?Adam Weinberg: Okay. So as we, or most of us know where cellular devices, eh very vulnerable to 2, 2, 2 different types of attacks. Actually, we pay for the sake of convenience that we that we all of us want to have, you know, being connected all the time and being able to to be found and to be to be available to anybody anywhere we pay for this convenience.With the price of being actually vulnerable to a different type of attacks. So we genuinely a. Eh, you CA you can, eh, generally fell two desktops, two to three types of attacks, which are accomplished by you know, organizations, some of them with, eh, some legal capabilities provided by the relevant government anywhere, some of them. Illegal body for individuals and thought, but usually take care of, take advantage of in model of the vulnerabilities that are available in the cell network.And usually there are three types of vulnerabilities. The first one is, eh, You\u2019ll seeing the fact that the seller long network is built in such a way that and a mess. Do you want to comment something? Oh no, no, no. I\u2019m sorry. Sorry. Ignore me. Okay. So the first vulnerability is based on the fact that the cell around network and the connectivity between cell networks around the world is built in such a way that whenever there is some, some sort of message call or any other message to be others to you.The connectivity in the network is such that you can be from, which means that. Yeah. Also, I take care of that knows how this information is forwarded in the exchange between the fellow networks can use the defect to perform a lot of damages. First of all, what we call location, tracking anybody. We, with the height knowledge in the high-tech to the silver.Global seller network. It could, it could activity between networks can quite easily find the find out about your location. And sometimes this is very you know, very important and relevant and, and knowing and intuition in your privacy. And. But then some valuable, very valuable information to the taker.Lisa Vaas:\u00a0Well, forgive me for interrupting Adam, but it, it can also be deadly as we\u2019ve seen in the murder of, of journalists, w the one in Mexico who was gunned down outside of a carwash.Adam Weinberg:\u00a0I will prefer not to fail to abuses of these possibilities and so on, but the possibility is the possibility there. And by manipulating the connectivity between the settlement networks, eh take care of can do a lot of damage. In addition to to, to take a given location, they can listen in to your, to the content of your communication as well.And they also add the images. So this is the first type of Vulnerability that is utilized by a attackers to utilizing the fact that the, the intrinsic need or necessity for a cell around it networks to exchange information in order to provide you with the service that you expect to eventually want to be found by someone that One to send some information to you.So this is the first type of attack. Second, second type of attack. If utilizing the fact that once you are using a mobile device you\u2019re connected over there. Our our channel to the nearest base station and the settler network is built in such a way that your phone is looking for the. Best sail around to be connected to an attacker.So using this effect to with with a device which pretends to be a genuine best station in the network, when actually it\u2019s not genuine, it\u2019s a fake best station utilized by, by the care for the purpose of convincing you have divided the field, the device with the genuine, eh best session your device has no way to usually has no way to differentiate between fake methylation and the real one, because all the information that is presented over the LF channel.But the fact that session seems to be Noma there. Then when the device. The target device is connected to the fake best dish and operated by the target. You know, there are many type of\u00a0 take the, can be implemented, like, eh, listening in on your communication, delivering malware to your device and the, and much more. So [00:07:00] this is a, the second type of, eh, of the texts utilized by taken of for, for implementing a tech fellow, the vices and the third type of a tech, if, if more commonly known as cyber techs utilizing the fact that eventually your cellular device.Connected to the, over the set alarm network, but eventually it is connected to the open internet and the like any device connected to the open internet. It\u2019s a volume. The. Different types of attacks like malware, malicious side, and the routing of your communications were so malicious gateways and so on.So in this respect, Your phone is like lepto one. It is the exposed to the open internet. It\u2019s a window to a different type of fintechs. So those are, those are generally the suite type of attacks, which we mentioned are utilized by let\u2019s say values organization. Some of them, you know, with legal authority, some of them without legal authority, but the, the, the possibilities up there and the device, the cellular devices are exposed to, to, to, to Two, a attackers, which are capable of implementing a lot of damages and extort a lot of significant information from the settler devices.Now we are. We, we mentioned also the possibility of protecting against such attacks. So this is the wartime in involved in the recent years. I have. In, in my Bitcoin, I was implementing, you know some, let me call it intelligence gathering solutions for certain, the organizations and also commercial intelligence gathering solutions for, for some companies that I\u2019ve worked for.And some. Five six ago, years ago together with partner of mine, we have decided to move on, to go to the other side of the street. Let me say, and use the experience that we have gathered in the implementing, eh taking solution into providing, eh, eh, protection solution, which you know, Very unique and, and can provide the complaints of protection against all the types of threats.To settle our devices, as I mentioned. So it\u2019s from the no, for me an activity from the signaling and connectivity between within the Celeron networks and between I think from fake best stations and implemented over the open internet connectivity. And this is we\u2019ve been, this is what we\u2019ve been doing in the last year.Lisa Vaas: Oh, well, let\u2019s take a little bit, a little bit of a closer look at one of those types of attacks, which would be the stingray scenario that you described where the cell towers are. I mean, how in the world would you convince a phone\u2019s technology? Not. To be able to differentiate between a stingray attack and real cell cell tower signaling.Adam Weinberg: Okay. So let me just describe generally, without going into too much technical details, our solution is implemented, with two major components. One component is integrated with the core network of the mobile network operator with virtually part of the integrated within the coordinator called the mobile network pivotal.The other part is implemented as a small piece of source software, which we\u2019ll call the in-app plate, which is implemented on the same card of the protected device. And the we have a photo of protected. Keep a live link between the power that is on the same and the power that you\u2019ve on the. Home network and by comparing various parameters about the connectivity to the network, we can we can detect possibilities.Eh, we can raise the suspect that the conductivity is being made. Eh, eh, eh, we\u2019re fake business. Also the, the possibility that the, by using distinct varied, the device is completely disconnected from the rail network. So the part that on the scene, the tech the situation, because the link to the home network, if disconnected now applies, and once we detect the situation, We start the process of challenging the the network from the SIM point of view and by this, eh, The challenge is met in such a way that only if it\u2019s a tall cell, eh, we get the expected apply.And if not, we we decide that if, if the, the, the connectivity to the network effect factor, [00:13:00] this is really interesting. So this has done in coordination with the wireless carrier. Did you say? Yeah. The part that, yeah, the part that is integrated with the home network is of course being implemented with support and coordination of of the mobile carrier.Lisa Vaas: Well, not that raises some interesting aspects of the the report. About how US phones. IPhones are protected. And we were wondering like, what makes us iPhones? So protected, is it is it because the wireless carriers in the us are working with solutions like yours to protect them?And they\u2019re not in other countries. I mean, how, when you say you\u2019re working with the wireless carriers in what countries are you, do you have that kind of cooperation in.Adam Weinberg: Well, the only a country that we can disclose so far is this. We are walking with in cooperation with the largest carrier in England, working in other countries as well.We still do not have any working solution with with the U S with scale. Mm. Yeah. Why not? Like what is it very difficult to iron these things out with the carriers? I mean, you know, young company, we are working on this, it\u2019s still implemented. Fair enough. So does your solution work with Androids and iPhones?I mean, I know the question I had about the report was. One of the major benefits of the. Solution of the ports that we have tooken in the, as I mentioned, if the tower solution is actually not implemented on the device itself, we just implemented on the seam in the device. And from the point of view of the scene, it doesn\u2019t matter.What is the AR device that\u2019s better? What is the operating system of the device, whether it\u2019s Android or\u00a0iPhone, it doesn\u2019t matter what a, you know, what version of the operating 50 with the some recent tab that was downloaded, the ethanol doesn\u2019t matter, but also if it says some device connected to. Over the film over the cellular round network is out any operating system, like a small controller, like let\u2019s say power meter or any, any device that is connected to the cellular network.And they\u2019re the same inside, or is. Can be protected with, by our solution. This is was our basic support. One of the unique, a unique things about the solution, right.Lisa Vaas: But I\u2019m still curious how journalists and activists and businesses can protect themselves. If they\u2019re not in Israel, do you have advice for them?Adam Weinberg:\u00a0Yeah. Working in cooperation also with. So called the global MBA knows the carrier, which can provide you could activity globally. And let\u2019s say one other 16 countries around the globe. And since we are already integrated with them by providing. You with the same of this global or no, we can, you can get protected connectivity everywhere in the globe, including in the us.Lisa Vaas: And you, I\u2019m sorry, you said a global NGO, Nongovernment organization?Adam Weinberg:\u00a0MVNO, mobile virtual network operator.Lisa Vaas: Thank you so much. I didn\u2019t didn\u2019t hear that. Okay. So, so there\u2019s still protection out there. Even if you\u2019re not in Israel, that\u2019s good to know. So what do\u00a0 people do to get that protection?What exactly are the steps that they have to do? Get a new SIM card. Is it as simple as that?Adam Weinberg:\u00a0Just to just get a new SIM card and you are protected.Lisa Vaas:\u00a0That\u2019s reassuring.I would hope to a lot of people who might be targeted well, well, awesome. Is there anything else, any other advice you\u2019d like to share with people who are probably a bit unnerved by the power of this spyware?Adam Weinberg: Just, you know, just the usual advice regarding cyber security, be careful be aware of, of messages to us safe, do not connect to any link that you are. Get from unknown people.Lisa Vaas: Well, that\u2019s a advice. We give them all the time and then you get something like this and it\u2019s like, it\u2019s done without [00:18:00] messages.It is sent by the messages that doesn\u2019t give off any alerts. And it\u2019s like, oh, but you\u2019re right. Of course the standard advice is going to apply to many situations. I\u2019m sure. Unless you have anything else you\u2019d like to add, Adam, I\u2019m going to let you go. Thank you so much for coming on the threat post today, Adam, this is such an important story and I\u2019m glad somebody figured out how to protect some people from these horrible attacks.Adam Weinberg: Thank you. Thank you, Lisa. Be well, thank you so much. Bye-bye.GovernmentHacksMalwareMobile SecurityNewsmaker InterviewsPodcasts",

        "raw text": "Israeli-based NSO Group is being blasted in a groundbreaking report that alleges that the company\u2019s controversial Pegasus malware is being used to target activists, journalists, business executives and politicians on a widespread level, using a variety of exploits \u2014 including a zero-click zero-day in iOS.A consortium of journalists leveled the allegations in a report called Pegasus Project, which was published Sunday. It examined leaked data from the NSO Group, which revealed a cache of more than 50,000 mobile phone numbers worldwide that the firm was storing, according to the report published by the Guardian newspaper.The report accuses NSO Group of selling its spy tool, Pegasus, to unidentified third-parties, including governments, who then use it to infect the phones of dissidents and other people who may be critical of a given regime. The malware can secretly take remote control of the phone to monitor activity, enabling \u201ccustomers\u201d to even read encrypted messages of their targets sent via Signal and Telegram.\u201cThe leak contains a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, it is believed, have been identified as those of people of interest by clients of NSO since 2016,\u201d according to the Guardian report.The Guardian, along with 16 additional media organizations, concluded that the NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus malware is in widespread use and used to target more than just criminals and terrorists, as the company insists are the primary and only targets of its spyware.In a statement issued by the NSO Group, it denies claims made in the Guardian report and those made by the Pegasus Project. It countered the report\u2019s conclusions are based on \u201cuncorroborated theories\u201d that are \u201cbased on misleading interpretation of leaked data.\u201dAmnesty International found in its report that the spyware is under active development, consistently adding zero-day exploits into the mix, including in iPhone attacks observed as recently as this month. Those attacks have been effective against the latest version of iOS, and are \u201czero-click,\u201d meaning that no user interaction or action is required to deliver an infection, according to the report.\u201cOn the iPhone of a French human rights lawyer (CODE FRHRL2), we observed a lookup of a suspicious iMessage account unknown to the victim, followed by an HTTP request performed by the \u2018com.apple.coretelephony\u2019 process,\u201d according to Amnesty International. \u201cThis is a component of iOS involved in all telephony-related tasks and likely among those exploited in this attack. We found traces of this HTTP request in a cache file stored on disk at /private/var/wireless/Library/Caches/com.apple.coretelephony/Cache.db, containing metadata on the request and the response. The phone sent information on the device including the model\u00a09,1\u00a0(iPhone 7) and iOS build number\u00a018C66 (version 14.3) to a service fronted by Amazon CloudFront, suggesting NSO Group has switched to using AWS services in recent months. At the time of this attack, the newer iOS version 14.4 had only been released for a couple of weeks.\u201dThe report added that zero-click attacks have been observed since May 2018; the most recent attack was observed exploiting multiple zero-days to attack a fully patched iPhone 12 running iOS 14.6 in July.Reported Pegasus VictimsThe Paris-based Forbidden Stories and Amnesty International were initially given access to the leaked list of 50,000 phone numbers. The Pegasus Project is careful to point out that the list of phone numbers does not indicate that all of those phones were targeted with an attack.\u201cThe presence of a phone number in the data does not reveal whether a device was infected with Pegasus or subject to an attempted hack. However, the consortium believes the data is indicative of the potential targets [that] NSO\u2019s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance attempts,\u201d according to the report.Reporters worked with researchers at Amnesty\u2019s Security Lab to examine 67 phones believed to be targeted with the Pegasus malware. It found that more than half (37) had \u201ctraces of Pegasus activity\u201d on them. Also, forensic analysis of leaked NSO Group data \u201csuggested\u201d the Pegasus spyware was used by Saudi Arabia and UAE to target phones of people close to murdered Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the months after his death.NSO in the HeadlinesIn October 2019, Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp sued NSO Group for creating tools allegedly used by its clients for reading the protected WhatsApp messages of journalists and human rights workers.NSO Group maintains to this day that its spy tools are meant to help law enforcement fight crime and terror. It has often asserted it is not complicit in any government\u2019s misuse of its technology.Meanwhile, a separate report by Citizen Lab published last week revealed that a private company, called variously Candiru, Grindavik, Saito Tech and Taveta (and dubbed \u201cSourgum\u201d by Microsoft), is hawking a malware dubbed DemonTongue that\u2019s being used for surveillance of dissidents by repressive regimes, even though it says itself that it sells its wares exclusively to governments to combat terror, similar to the NSO Group.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentMalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "A set of unique spyware strains created by an Israeli firm and allegedly used by governments around the world to surveil dissidents has been defanged by Microsoft, the software giant said.The private company, called variously Candiru, Grindavik, Saito Tech and Taveta (and dubbed \u201cSourgum\u201d by Microsoft), reportedly sells its wares exclusively to governments, according to Citizen Lab, which first analyzed the malware and flagged it for Microsoft. The code, collectively known as \u201cDevilsTongue,\u201d has been used in highly targeted cyberattacks against civil society, according to an advisory issued Thursday \u2013 making use of a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities in Windows (now patched).The victims number more than 100, and include politicians, human-rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers and political dissidents, Citizen Lab and Microsoft said. The targets have been global, located in Armenia, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, Singapore, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom and Yemen.\u201cSourgum generally sells cyberweapons that enable its customers, often government agencies around the world, to hack into their targets\u2019 computers, phones, network infrastructure and internet-connected devices,\u201d according to Microsoft\u2019s tandem advisory. \u201cThese agencies then choose who to target and run the actual operations themselves.\u201dCitizen Lab researchers said that DevilsTongue can exfiltrate data and messages from various accounts, including Facebook, Gmail, Skype and Telegram. The spyware can also capture browsing history, cookies and passwords, turn on the target\u2019s webcam and microphone, and take pictures of the screen.\u201cCapturing data from additional apps, such as Signal Private Messenger, is sold as an add-on,\u201d according to the firm.Microsoft noted that the stolen cookies can later be used by the attacker to sign in as the victim to websites to enable further information gathering.The code can infect and monitor Android phones, cloud accounts, iPhones, Macs and PCs, Citizen Lab researchers said, noting that DevilsTongue\u2019s command-and-control (C2) infrastructure involves more than 750 websites, including \u201cdomains masquerading as advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International, the Black Lives Matter movement as well as media companies.\u201dMillions of EurosDevilsTongue as a kit goes for millions of Euros, according to a leaked proposal [PDF] obtained by Citizen Lab. It can be deployed in a number of attack vectors, including via malicious links,\u00a0 attached files in emails and man-in-the-middle attacks. The cost depends on the number of concurrent infections a user would like to maintain.\u201cThe \u20ac16 million project proposal allows for an unlimited number of spyware infection attempts, but the monitoring of only 10 devices simultaneously,\u201d according to Citizen Lab. \u201cFor an additional \u20ac1.5M, the customer can purchase the ability to monitor 15 additional devices simultaneously, and to infect devices in a single additional country. For an additional \u20ac5.5M, the customer can monitor 25 additional devices simultaneously, and conduct espionage in five more countries.\u201dIt added, \u201cFor a further additional \u20ac1.5M fee, customers can purchase a remote-shell capability, which allows them full access to run any command or program on the target\u2019s computer. This kind of capability is especially concerning, given that it could also be used to download files, such as planting incriminating materials, onto an infected device.\u201dUse of DevilsTongue is restricted in a handful of countries, including China, Iran, Israel, Russia and the U.S. However, there are, apparently, loopholes.\u201cMicrosoft observed Candiru victims in Iran, suggesting that in some situations, products from Candiru do operate in restricted territories,\u201d Citizen Lab researchers said. \u201cIn addition, targeting infrastructure disclosed in this report includes domains masquerading as the Russian postal service.\u201dZero-Day ExploitsThe spyware exploits two elevation-of-privilege security vulnerabilities in Windows, CVE-2021-31979 and CVE-2021-33771, both of which were addressed in Microsoft\u2019s July Patch Tuesday update this week. The attacks are carried out via \u201ca chain of exploits that impacted popular browsers and our Windows operating system,\u201d Microsoft noted.Both bugs give an attacker the ability to escape browser sandboxes and gain kernel code execution, Microsoft said:CVE-2021-31979: An integer overflow within Windows NT-based operating system (NTOS). \u201cThis overflow results in an incorrect buffer size being calculated, which is then used to allocate a buffer in the kernel pool,\u201d according to Microsoft. \u201cA buffer overflow subsequently occurs while copying memory to the smaller-than-expected destination buffer. This vulnerability can be leveraged to corrupt an object in an adjacent memory allocation. Using APIs from user mode, the kernel pool memory layout can be groomed with controlled allocations, resulting in an object being placed in the adjacent memory location. Once corrupted by the buffer overflow, this object can be turned into a user mode to kernel mode read/write primitive. With these primitives in place, an attacker can then elevate their privileges.\u201dCVE-2021-33771: A race condition within NTOS resulting in the use-after-free of a kernel object. \u201cBy using multiple racing threads, the kernel object can be freed, and the freed memory reclaimed by a controllable object,\u201d explained Microsoft. \u201cLike the previous vulnerability, the kernel pool memory can be sprayed with allocations using user mode APIs with the hopes of landing an object allocation within the recently freed memory. If successful, the controllable object can be used to form a user mode to kernel mode read/write primitive and elevate privileges.\u201dTo mitigate the attacks, Microsoft said that it \u201cbuilt protections into our products against the unique malware Sourgum created,\u201d in addition to the patching.\u201cThese attacks have largely targeted consumer accounts, indicating Sourgum\u2019s customers were pursuing particular individuals,\u201d according to Microsoft. \u201cThe protections we issued this week will prevent Sourgum\u2019s tools from working on computers that are already infected and prevent new infections on updated computers and those running Microsoft Defender Antivirus as well as those using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.\u201dPrivate brokers of cyberattack kits for government surveillance have been publicized mainly thanks to another Israeli firm, NSO Group, which created the Pegasus spyware that enables customers to remotely exploit and monitor mobile devices. NSO Group has long maintained that its kit is meant to be a tool for governments to use in fighting crime and terror, and that it\u2019s not complicit in any government\u2019s misuse of it. However, critics say that repressive governments use it for more nefarious purposes to track dissidents, journalists and other members of civil society \u2014 and that NSO Group assists them. In December, Pegasus added an exploit for a zero-day in Apple\u2019s iMessage feature for iPhone.Check out our free\u00a0upcoming live and on-demand webinar events \u2013 unique, dynamic discussions with cybersecurity experts and the Threatpost community.GovernmentMalwareMobile SecurityVulnerabilities",

        "raw text": "Android mobile phone users across the U.K. and Europe are being targeted by text messages containing a particularly nasty piece of spyware called \u201cFlubot,\u201d according to the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre. And the U.S. could be the next target.Victims are asked to download a fake app from a malicious website. Click to enlarge.The malware is delivered to targets through SMS texts and prompts them to install a \u201cmissed package delivery\u201d app. Instead, it takes victims to a scam website where they download the \u201capp\u201d \u2014 which is really just the spyware. Once installed, it then sets about gaining permissions, stealing banking information and credentials, lifting passwords stored on the device and squirreling away various pieces of personal information. It also sends out additional text messages to the infected device\u2019s contact list, which allows it to \u201cgo viral\u201d \u2014 like the flu.The U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued security guidance about how to identify and remove FluBot malware, while network providers including\u00a0Three\u00a0and\u00a0Vodafone\u00a0have also issued warnings to users over the text message attacks.So far, most of the phishing texts are branded to look like they are being sent from DHL, the NCSC said, but warned, \u201cthe scam could change to abuse other company brands.\u201dOne victim posted a message posing as a link from the Royal Mail.Another user on Twitter spotted this scam \u201cAmazon\u201d message which they point out swaps the \u201co\u201d for a zero in the link.Telecom carriers Vodafone UK, Three UK and EE have all confirmed the scam is traversing their networks, which collectively have more than 58 million subscribers across the country.\u26a0\ufe0fSCAM TEXT ALERT \u26a0\ufe0fIf you receive a text message that looks like the one below:IGNORE: Do not click any links.REPORT: Report it by forwarding to 7726.DELETE: Remove the text from your phone. pic.twitter.com/ailKcmXYh4\u2014 Vodafone UK (@VodafoneUK) April 22, 2021Anyone who receives what they believe to be a scam text is advised not to click on any links and forward the text to \u201c7726\u201d a \u201cfree spam-reporting line\u201d established to combat fraud in the U.K. Finally, delete the message and block the sender.If a user has already clicked on the link, the NCSC warned not to enter any password or other personal information. To remove the malware from the infected device, \u201cPerform a factory reset as soon as possible,\u201d the NSCS guidance reads. \u201cThe process for doing this will vary based on the device manufacturer\u2026Note that if you don\u2019t have backups enabled, you will lose data.\u201dThe NCSC added that if a user has entered their personal information, it\u2019s critical to change those passwords immediately to prevent further compromise.To prevent future attacks, NSCS said users should back up any important information, only install a minimal number of apps from trusted sources and use available virus protection offered by Google Play and others.SMS Phishing (\u2018Smishing\u2019) On the Rise These types of SMS phishing scams, also known as \u201csmishing,\u201d aren\u2019t anything new. In February, attackers were harvesting personal data of users in the U..K. with fake messages promising tax refunds for overpayment. \u00a0Mobile phishing has been a booming business since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say, which they expect will only continue to grow.Paul Ducklin, researcher at Sophos, explained why smishing is becoming such a popular choice for threat actors in discussing the February campaign.\u201cSMSes are limited to 160 characters, including any web links,\u201d Ducklin said. \u201cSo there\u2019s much less room for crooks to make spelling and grammatical errors, and they don\u2019t need to bother with all the formalized cultural pleasantries (such as \u2018Dear Your Actual Name\u2019) that you\u2019d expect in an email.\u201dDucklin also pointed out the small mobile screen makes it harder for users to detect a scam, adding \u201conce you\u2019ve tapped on the link and the browser window has filled the screen, it\u2019s harder to spot that you are on an imposter site.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook, \u201c2021: The Evolution of Ransomware,\u201d to help hone your cyber-defense strategies against this growing scourge.

        "raw text": "Researchers allege, attackers have compromised the update mechanism of NoxPlayer, which is software that allows gamers to run Android apps on their PCs or Macs. They then installed malware onto victims\u2019 devices with surveillance-related capabilities.NoxPlayer is developed by BigNox, which is a China-based company that claims that it has over 150 million users worldwide (notably, however, BigNox users are predominantly in Asian countries). When contacted by researchers, BigNox denied being affected by the attack. Threatpost has reached out to BigNox for further comment.\u201cWe have contacted BigNox about the intrusion, and they denied being affected,\u201d said Ignacio Sanmillan, malware researcher with ESET,\u00a0on Monday. \u201cWe have also offered our support to help them past the disclosure in case they decide to conduct an internal investigation.\u201dOn the heels of the alleged attack, which occurred January 2021, three different malware families have been deployed \u2013 reportedly from tailored, malicious updates \u2013 to a very select set of victims.\u00a0Researchers said, out of more than the 100,000 users in their telemetry that have Noxplayer installed on their machines, only five users received a malicious update, showing the attack is a \u201chighly targeted operation.\u201d These victims are based in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sri Lanka.Sanmillan told Threatpost researchers haven\u2019t been able to find the reasons why these individuals were targeted.\u201cWe were unsuccessful finding correlations that would suggest any relationships among victims,\u201d said Sanmillan. \u201cHowever, based on the compromised software in question and the delivered malware exhibiting surveillance capabilities, we believe this may indicate the intent of collecting intelligence on targets somehow involved in the gaming community.\u201dResearchers claim that the attack vector stems from NoxPlayer\u2019s update mechanism.\u00a0They said they have \u201csufficient evidence\u201d to show that the BigNox infrastructure (res06.bignox.com) was compromised to host malware. They also assert that BigNox\u2019s HTTP API infrastructure (api.bignox.com),\u00a0used for requests and responses between the clients and BigNox servers, may have been compromised as well.The location of victims. Credit: ESETA normal NoxPlayer update process works as follows: Upon launch NoxPlayer queries the update server via the BigNox HTTP API (api.bignox.com) in order to retrieve specific update information. If NoxPlayer detects a newer version of the software, it prompts the user with an option to install it. If the user chooses to update, the main NoxPlayer binary application (Nox.exe) supplies update parameters received to another binary in its toolbox (NoxPack.exe), which is in charge of downloading the update.For victims, the attack occurs when the\u00a0BigNox API server responds to the client request with specific update information, including the URL to download the update from BigNox legitimate infrastructure. Here, researchers believe that either the legitimate update stored in BigNox infrastructure may have been replaced with malware, or that the URL given by the BigNox API server is not used for legitimate updates. Either way, malicious files are then deployed via the update mechanism, \u00a0and malware is then installed on the victim\u2019s machine.Unlike legitimate BigNox updates, these malicious files are not digitally signed, strongly suggesting that the BigNox build system was not compromised, but just its systems that distribute updates, said researchers.Also, \u201cwe are highly confident that these additional updates were performed by Nox.exe supplying specific parameters to NoxPack.exe, suggesting that the BigNox API mechanism may have also been compromised to deliver tailored malicious updates,\u201d said Sanmillan.While it could be argued that the attack is a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack rather than a full-on compromise, researchers said they believe this is \u201cunlikely.\u201d MiTM attacks occur\u00a0when an attacker intercepts communications between two parties in order to modify traffic traveling between the two.\u00a0However, researchers said the attacker already had a foothold on the BigNox infrastructure. Also, they said they were unable to reproduce the download of the malware samples while using the HTTPS protocol (hosted on\u00a0res06.bignox.com) from a test machine.Researchers observed three different malware variants utilized in the attacks. While the first malware variant had not been previously detected, the second variants deployed a final payload consisting of a variant of\u00a0the known Gh0st malware, a remote access trojan (RAT) that has keylogger capabilities. The third variant meanwhile deployed the known PoisonIvy RAT, which has spying capabilities, as its final payload.While all three malware samples had slight variations in how they were deployed and their bundled components, all had basic monitoring capabilities. For instance, all malware variants were able to download specific files and directories from the victims, delete specified files from the disk, and upload files.\u201cThe malware we analyzed contain data exfiltration, keylogging and arbitrary command execution,\u201d Sanmillan told Threatpost. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that the last capability open a very wide range of opportunity for the attackers.\u201dThe targeted gaming victimology makes this campaign stand out, said researchers, as cyberespionage attacks are typically instead targeted at governments\u00a0or human-rights activists.\u201cWe have detected various supply-chain attacks in the last year, such as\u00a0Operation SignSight\u00a0or the compromise of\u00a0Able Desktop\u00a0among others,\u201d said Sanmillan. \u201cHowever, the supply-chain compromise involved in Operation NightScout is particularly interesting due to the targeted vertical, as we rarely encounter many cyberespionage operations targeting online gamers.\u201dDownload our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World, sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "Facebook subsidiary WhatsApp has received new high-caliber support in its case against Israeli intelligence company NSO Group. The court case aims to hold NSO Group accountable for distributing its Pegasus spyware on the popular WhatsApp messaging service with the intent of planting its spyware on phones of journalists and human rights workers.A group of companies\u2013including tech giants Google, Microsoft and Cisco Systems\u2013have filed a legal brief called an amicus to support WhatsApp against NSO\u2019s alleged illegal cyber-surveillance activities, including selling \u201ccyber-surveillance as a service\u201d to foreign governments and other companies. VMWare and GitHub also signed the brief along with LinkedIn\u2013a Microsoft subsidiary\u2013and the Internet Association, which represents dozens of tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook and Twitter.Meanwhile, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed an amicus brief of its own to support WhatsApp, asserting that the case is not merely a battle of tech companies, but has a potential outcome that will have \u201cprofound implications for millions of Internet users and other citizens of countries around the world.\u201dAmicus briefs are known as \u201camicus curiae\u201d in legal terms, which is Latin for \u201cfriend of the court.\u201d The briefs are common in appellate cases to make points or provide new information that the principle litigators in the case may not have addressed.In this case, the briefs are aimed at lending support to WhatsApp in an effort to convince the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to hold NSO accountable for its activities. The current case in front of the court is an appeal for immunity that the NSO filed after a federal judge allowed a suit WhatsApp originally filed in October 2019 to move forward earlier this year.NSO President Shiri Dolev has defended the company, saying it should be protected against legal action since it sells its tools to governments and law enforcement who use them to go after criminals and find victims of disasters, among other benevolent activities.Tech companies and the original judge in the case so far haven\u2019t been convinced by this argument. \u201cEven if the tools are sold to governments who use them for narrowly targeted attacks, there are a variety of ways they can still fall into the wrong hands,\u201d Tom Burt, Microsoft corporate vice president of customer security and trust, said in a blog post published Monday supporting the amicus.\u201cThe expansion of sovereign immunity that NSO seeks would further encourage the burgeoning cyber-surveillance industry to develop, sell and use tools to exploit vulnerabilities in violation of U.S. law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPrivate companies should remain subject to liability when they use their cyber-surveillance tools to break the law, or knowingly permit their use for such purposes, regardless of who their customers are or what they\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201dThe EFF, which often butts heads against tech companies over privacy issues, in this case is aligned with them against NSO.\u201cCorporate complicity in human rights abuses is a widespread and ongoing problem, and the Ninth Circuit should not expand the ability of technology companies like NSO Group to avoid accountability for facilitating human rights abuses by foreign governments,\u201d EFF senior staff attorneys Sophia Cope and Andrew Crocker wrote in a blog post also published Monday regarding the EFF\u2019s amicus.In the original case, WhatsApp sued NSO Group for allegedly creating tools such as Pegasus so its clients can spy on and read the protected WhatsApp messages of journalists and human rights workers. The case stemmed from the discovery in May 2019 of a\u00a0zero-day vulnerability\u00a0in WhatsApp\u2019s messaging platform, exploited by attackers who were able to inject the Pegasus spyware onto victims\u2019 phones in targeted campaigns.The lawsuit alleges that\u00a0NSO Group\u00a0developed the surveillance code and used vulnerable WhatsApp servers to send malware to approximately 1,400 mobile devices, including those of more than 100 human-rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society in at least 20 countries across the globe.\u201cAs we gathered the information that we lay out in our complaint, we learned that the attackers used servers and internet-hosting services that were previously associated with NSO,\u201d said Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, in a\u00a0post when the lawsuit was filed. \u201cIn addition, as our complaint notes, we have tied certain WhatsApp accounts used during the attacks back to NSO. While their attack was highly sophisticated, their attempts to cover their tracks were not entirely successful.\u201dWhatsApp has claimed that the attack violates various U.S. state and federal laws, including the\u00a0U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and aims with the suit to bar NSO Group from using Facebook and WhatsApp services, among seeking other unspecified damages.Download our exclusive FREE Threatpost Insider eBook Healthcare Security Woes Balloon in a Covid-Era World , sponsored by ZeroNorth, to learn more about what these security risks mean for hospitals at the day-to-day level and how healthcare security teams can implement best practices to protect providers and patients.

        "raw text": "Threat actors continue to take advantage of the hype surrounding the release of the videogame Cyberpunk 2077 in a variety of ways. The latest twist is ransomware targeting Android devices disguised as a legitimate download of the new open-world game.Kaspersky researcher Tatyana Shishkova discovered the malware earlier this week, and in a tweet described the sample as a type of CoderWare ransomware, more specifically of the \u201cBlack Kingdom\u201d family.\u00a0 She noted that the malware code was being promoted as a download of Cyberpunk 2077 from a fake version of the Google Play mobile app marketplace.The listing for the game, which is named \u201cCyberpunk 2077 Mobile (Beta),\u201d even had reviews from users so as to appear legitimate \u2013 as seen on one of several screenshots of the scam that Shishkova posted on Twitter.\nIf users click on the download and execute the binary, they received a message informing them that they\u2019ve been infected with CoderWare ransomware. Next, victims are advised, via the ransomware note, to take a screenshot of the message, which contains information for decryption. Hackers request that victims pay $500 in Bitcoin to obtain the key for unlocking decrypted files.New Android #Ransomware disguised as #Cyberpunk2077 game.Downloaded from fake website imitating Google Play Store.Extension: .coderCryptFamily: CoderWare/BlackKingdom https://t.co/JBudDP6vG1 pic.twitter.com/TdM4SAkFWl\u2014 Tatyana Shishkova (@sh1shk0va) December 16, 2020Shishkova, however, noted that CoderWare ransomware uses\u00a0a hardcoded key, which means that paying the ransom may not be necessary if someone falls victim to the scam.\u201cRC4 algorithm with hardcoded key (in this example \u2013 \u201821983453453435435738912738921\u2019) is used for encryption,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThat means that if you got your files encrypted by this #ransomware, it is possible to decrypt them without paying the ransom.\u201dCoderWare: A Magnet for Cyber PunksCoderWare has been linked to Cyberpunk 2077 in the past. The Malware Hunter team tweeted in November that they had discovered a version of the ransomware for Python disguised as a Windows Cyberpunk 2077 installer, according to a report in BleepingComputer. Both that version of CoderWare and the one discovered by Shishkova appear to be variants of the Black Kingdom ransomware, which was seen earlier this year in attacks on Pulse Secure VPNs.The hotly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 lets players create a character called \u201cV\u201d who lives in Night City and even features a digital Keanu Reeves as a major character. Before the game was even released, threat actors were exploiting its popularity with scams offering \u201cfree copies\u201d of the game while stealing personal information, something researchers at Kaspersky also uncovered.The latest scam is similar but with a twist, as the game is already available for purchase and download for PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Stadia, with compatibility with PS5 and Xbox Series X for a price tag of $60.Rocky Release of Cyberpunk 2077As if cyber threats surrounding the game aren\u2019t enough to turn game enthusiasts off, there are myriad other issues with Cyberpunk 2077 that gamers have reported with the initial release of the title, including poor performance and numerous bugs and glitches that make the user experience less than pleasant.It\u2019s gotten so bad that Sony even pulled the game from the PlayStation store, offering those who purchased it already a full refund. To make matters even worse, some users seeking refunds then experienced problems with downloading the form to register for that refund, something Sony said it would fix as soon as possible.\u201cWhat a mess!\u201d tweeted James Webber, a writer and director who already downloaded and played Cyberpunk 77\u2014expressing what is likely a similar sentiment among early adopters. \u201cDespite quite enjoying the game so far, I\u2019ve encountered almost too many bugs to count.

        "raw text": "New spyware is targeting iOS and Android frequenters of adult mobile sites by posing as a secure messaging application in yet another twist on sextortionist scams.The spyware, dubbed Goontact, targets users of escort-service sites and other sex-oriented services \u2013 particularly in Chinese-speaking countries, Korea and Japan, according to research published by Lookout Threat Intelligence on Wednesday.The ploy and malware can ultimately be used to exfiltrate data from targets. Data siphoned from devices include phone number, contact list, SMS messages, photos and location information. The nature of the data sweep and the context of the attacks \u201csuggests that the ultimate goal is extortion or blackmail,\u201d researchers Robert Nickle, Apurva Kumar and Justin Albrecht observed in a report published online Wednesday.Click to register.Sextortionist scams, in which threat actors claim they have video or other information that links a potential victim to illicit activity that could threaten a marriage, job or other significant relationship or interest, are nothing new. However, attackers typically use email to deliver these type of scams, using a range of tactics to get past email defenses and trick victims.The new campaign uses a different and evolving tack. It lures a potential target by inviting them through an ad on a hosted illicit site to connect with women for free by using KakaoTalk or Telegram secure messaging apps. If someone takes the bait and initiates a conversation, it is Goontact operators with whom the person makes contact, researchers said.\u201cTargets are convinced to install (or sideload) a mobile application on some pretext, such as audio or video problems,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe mobile applications in question appears to have no real user functionality, except to steal the victim\u2019s address book, which is then used by the attacker ultimately to extort the target for monetary gain.\u201dThe specifics of the attack are different depending on if a victim is using an iOS or Android device. The iOS attacks have less capability to steal data, lifting only the victim\u2019s phone number and contact list, researchers said. In some later iterations of the spyware, it connects to a secondary command-and-control (C2) server and displays a message tailored to the user before exiting the app.The Android-based attack has significantly more threat capability, researchers said. \u201cIn addition to contact stealing, these samples contain more advanced functionality such as exfiltration of SMS messages, photos and location,\u201d researchers wrote.The Lookout team believes that the information stolen in the campaign will be used to blackmail or defraud victims, although so far they said they have seen no evidence proving this scenario.The campaign itself bears resemblance to one reported by researchers in 2015, and Lookout researchers suspect it\u2019s been around and operated by a crime affiliate rather than nation-state actors since 2013.\u201cHowever, the Goontact malware family is novel and is still actively being developed,\u201d with the earliest sample having been observed in November 2018, researchers said.Lookout researchers have contacted Google and Apple about Goontact as well as informed Threat Advisory Services customers with additional intelligence on the spyware and other threats.Put Ransomware on the Run:\u00a0Save your spot for \u201cWhat\u2019s Next for Ransomware,\u201d a\u00a0FREE Threatpost webinar\u00a0on\u00a0Dec. 16 at 2 p.m. ET.\u00a0Find out what\u2019s coming in the ransomware world and how to fight back.\u00a0Get the latest from John (Austin) Merritt, Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst at Digital Shadows; Limor Kessem, Executive Security Advisor, IBM Security; and Allie Mellen, a security strategist in the Office of the CSO at Cybereason,\u00a0on new kinds of attacks.

The last piece of major development news came in 2018, when developers behind the malware made key changes to the RAT\u2019s code in an attempt to decrease antivirus detection.Recently though, Kaspersky researchers spotted updated GravityRAT code indicating an overhaul of the the malware. \u201cFurther investigation confirmed that the group behind the [GravityRAT] malware had invested effort into making it into a multiplatform tool\u2026the campaign is still active,\u201d according research published on Monday.The malware is capable of retrieving device data, contact lists, email addresses, call logs and SMS messages and can exfiltrate various types of documents and files.Following the RAT\u2019s BreadcrumbsOn the mobile front, Kaspersky was tipped off that GravityRAT was back when researchers observed a piece of malicious code inserted in an Android travel application for Indian users.After some code analysis, they were able to determine that the malware module was in fact a relative of GravityRAT. Then, researchers decided to look further, since the code \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like a typical piece of Android spyware,\u201d researchers said.\u201cAnalysis of the command-and-control (C2) addresses the module used revealed several additional malicious modules, also related to the actor behind GravityRAT,\u201d they explained.Malicious travel app. Source: Kaspersky.Overall, the analysis turned up more than 10 new versions of GravityRAT, all distributed within trojanized applications \u2013 including those masquerading as secure file-sharing applications or media players. Used together, these modules represent a multiplatform code base that enables the group to tap into Windows OS, MacOS and Android.\u201cThe main modification seen in the new GravityRAT campaign is multiplatformity,\u201d researchers said. \u201cBesides Windows, there are now versions for Android and macOS. The cybercriminals also started using digital signatures to make the apps look more legitimate.\u201dOnce installed, the spyware receives commands from the server. Commands include Get-command information about the system; search for files on the computer and removable disks (with the extensions .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, .xls, .xlsx, .pdf, .odt, .odp, and .ods); upload files to the server; get a list of running processes; intercept keystrokes; take screenshots; execute arbitrary shell commands; record audio and scan ports.The campaign is continuing, mainly targeting victims in India. This continues GravityRAT\u2019s standard victimology. Kaspersky also believes that the malware is spreading in the same way that older versions did such as social media, where targeted individuals are sent links pointing to malicious apps and programs.\u201cIn 2019,\u00a0The Times of India\u00a0published an\u00a0article\u00a0about the cybercriminal methods used to distribute GravityRAT during the period 2015-2018,\u201d according to the analysis. \u201cVictims were contacted through a fake Facebook account, and asked to install a malicious app disguised as a secure messenger in order to continue the conversation. Around 100 cases of infection of employees at defense, police, and other departments and organizations were identified.\u201dThe main change in the tactics is the investment into expanding the group\u2019s target base, researchers concluded.\u201cOur investigation indicated that the actor behind GravityRAT is continuing to invest in its spying capacities,\u201d said Tatyana Shishkova, security expert at Kaspersky, in a statement. \u201cCunning disguise and an expanded OS portfolio not only allow us to say that we can expect more incidents with this malware in the APAC region, but this also supports the wider trend that malicious users are not necessarily focused on developing new malware, but developing proven ones instead, in an attempt to be as successful as possible.\u201dMalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A wide-open app-building API would allow an attacker to build a malicious application that could access Fitbit user data, and send it to any server.Kev Breen, director of cyber threat research for Immersive Labs, created a proof-of-concept for just that scenario, after realizing that Fitbit devices are loaded with sensitive personal data.\u201cEssentially, [the developer API] could send device type, location and user information including gender, age, height, heart rate and weight,\u201d Breen explained. \u201cIt could also access calendar information. While this doesn\u2019t include PII profile data, the calendar invites could expose additional information such as names and locations.\u201dClick to Register!Since all of this information is available via the Fitbit application developer API, it was a simple process to create an application to carry out the attack. Breen\u2019s efforts resulted in a malicious watch face, which he was then able to make available through the Fitbit Gallery (where Fitbit showcases various third-party and in-house apps). Thus, the spyware appears legitimate, and increases the likelihood it would be downloaded.\u201cUsing a dashboard used by development teams to preview apps, I submitted our spyware and soon had our own URL at https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/<redacted>,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur spyware was now live on fitbit.com. It is important to note that while Fitbit doesn\u2019t count this as \u2018available for public download\u2019, the link was still accessible in the public domain and our \u2018malware\u2019 was still downloadable. \u201dIncreasing the air of legitimacy, when the link was clicked on any mobile device, it opened inside the Fitbit app with \u201call thumbnails perfectly rendered as if it were a legitimate app,\u201d Breen said. \u201cFrom there, it was just a quick click to download and install, which I did with both Android and iPhone.\u201dBreen also found that Fitbit\u2019s fetch API allows the use of HTTP to internal IP ranges, which he abused to turn the malicious watch face into a primitive network scanner.\u201cWith this functionality, our watch face could become a threat to the enterprise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be used to do everything from identifying and accessing routers, firewalls and other devices, to brute-forcing passwords and reading the company intranet \u2013 all from inside the app on the phone.\u201dFitbit FixesAfter contacting Fitbit about the issues, Breen said the company was responsive and vowed to make the necessary changes to mitigate future breaches.\u201cThe trust of our customers is paramount, and we are committed to protecting consumer privacy and keeping data safe,\u201d Fitbit told Threatpost, in a statement. \u201cWe responded immediately when contacted by this researcher and worked quickly and collaboratively to address the concerns they raised. We are not aware of any actual compromise of user data.\u201dFitbit has added a warning message for users within the UI when installing an app from a private link, and it has made it easier for consumers to identify which installed apps/clocks on the mobile device are not publicly listed.Breen said that Fitbit also has committed to adjusting default permission settings during the authorization flow to being opted out by default.As for the ease of uploading the malicious app to the gallery, \u201cwe we were advised that apps submitted to the Fitbit Gallery for public download undergo manual review and that obvious spyware or applications masquerading as something else are likely to be caught and blocked from being published.\u201dHowever, Breen\u2019s malicious watch face was still publicly accessible as of early Friday. [It was removed later in the day \u2014 ed.]\u201cWe encourage consumers to only install applications from sources they know and trust and to be mindful of what data they\u2019re sharing with third parties,\u201d Fitbit concluded. \u201cWe give our users control over what data they share and with whom.\u201dFitbit isn\u2019t alone in representing an internet-of-things threat surface. The sheer exploding numbers of IoT devices coming online every day is making it hard for the security community to stay ahead of malicious actors.Last month, researchers realized the Mozi botnet peer-to-peer malware accounted for a full 90 percent of traffic on IoT devices. And\u00a0 Bluetooth spoofing bug was recently found to leave billions of devices vulnerable. Even a connected male chastity device was recently discovered to be easily hacked, leaving the unsuspecting user stuck and in need of rescue.As the rest of the industry catches up, it is end users who need to be empowered to take precautions to protect their data.Breen offers this advice; \u201cif in doubt, don\u2019t install it.\u201d\u00a0On October 14 at 2 PM ET\u00a0Get the latest information on the rising threats to retail e-commerce security and how to stop them.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this FREE Threatpost webinar, \u201cRetail Security: Magecart and the Rise of e-Commerce Threats.\u201d Magecart and other threat actors are riding the rising wave of online retail usage and racking up big numbers of consumer victims.

        "raw text": "Researchers say they have uncovered a new Android spyware variant with an updated command-and-control communication strategy and extended surveillance capabilities that snoops on social media apps WhatsApp and Telegram.The malware, Android/SpyC32.A, is currently being used in active campaigns targeting victims in the Middle East. It is a new variant of an existing malware operated by threat group APT-C-23 (also known as Two-Tailed Scorpion and Desert Scorpion). APT-C-23 is known to utilize both Windows and Android components, and has previously targeted victims in the Middle East with apps in order to compromise Android smartphones.\u201cOur research shows that the APT-C-23 group is still active, enhancing its mobile toolset and running new operations,\u201d according to researchers with ESET in a report released Wednesday. \u201cAndroid/SpyC32.A \u2013 the group\u2019s newest spyware version \u2013 features several improvements making it more dangerous to victims.\u201dAPT-C-23\u2019s activities \u2013 including its mobile malware \u2013 were first described in 2017 by several security research teams. Meanwhile, the updated version, Android/SpyC23.A, has been in the wild since May 2019 and was first detected by researchers in June 2020.The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn\u2019t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name.\u00a0Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware.Researchers also said they don\u2019t know how this fake WeMessage app\u00a0was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the \u201cDigitalApps\u201d store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the \u201cDigitalApps\u201d store.New UpdatesPreviously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users.Legitimate WeMessage app. Credit: ESETThis latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from social media and messaging apps. The spyware can now record victims\u2019 screens and take screenshots, record incoming and outgoing calls in WhatsApp and read text of notifications from social media apps, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype and Messenger.The malware also leverages a tactic where it creates a blank screen overlay to put on the Android screen while it makes calls, which helps it hide its call activity. In another technique to hide its activity the malware can dismiss its own notifications. Researchers say this is an unusual feature, possibly used in case of errors or warnings displayed by the malware.Finally, the new version of the malware can dismiss notifications from built-security security apps for Android devices (allowing it to hide security warnings of suspicious activity from the victim), including Samsung notifications, SecurityLogAgent notifications on Samsung devices, MIUI Security notifications on Xiaomi devices and Phone Manager on Huawei devices.The malware\u2019s C2 communications have also received a facelift. In older versions, the malware used hardcoded C2, either available in plain text or trivially obfuscated \u2013 meaning it was easier to identify. In the updated version, however, the C2 is well hidden using various techniques and can be remotely changed by the attacker, making detection much more difficult, researchers said.Other APT-C-23 SightingsIt\u2019s not the first analysis of APT-C-23 this year. At the beginning of 2020, Check Point Research\u00a0reported\u00a0new mobile malware attacks attributed to the APT-C-23 group.\u00a0In April 2020, meanwhile, @malwrhunterteam\u00a0tweeted\u00a0about a new Android malware variant, which researchers \u2013 in cooperation with @malwrhunterteam \u2013 recognized to be part of the APT-C-23 operations. Then in June 2020, @malwrhunterteam\u00a0tweeted\u00a0about another Android malware sample, which was connected to the sample from April.APT-C-23 malware timeline. Credit: ESETTo avoid falling victim to spyware, researchers advised Android users to only install apps from the official Google Play app store and to scrutinize apps\u2019 permissions.\u201cIn cases where privacy concerns, access issues or other restrictions prevent users from following this advice, users should take extra care when downloading apps from unofficial sources,\u201d said researchers. \u201cWe recommend scrutinizing the app\u2019s developer, double-checking the permissions requested, and using a trustworthy and up-to-date mobile security solution.\u201dMalwareMobile Security",

        "raw text": "Researchers have discovered a new Android spyware campaign pushing a \u201cPro\u201d version of the TikTok app that is exploiting fears among its young and gullible users that the popular social media app is on the cusp of being banned in the United States. The malware can take over basic device functions\u2014such as capturing photos, reading and sending SMS messages, making calls and launching apps\u2014as well as uses a phishing tactic to steal victims\u2019 Facebook credentials.The rogue app called TikTok Pro is being promoted by threat actors using a variant of a campaign already making the rounds, which urges users via SMS and WhatsApp messages to download the latest version of TikTok from a specific web address, said Zscaler senior security researcher Shivang Desai, in a report published Tuesday.The first wave of the campaign spread a fake\u00a0app, containing malware dubbed \u201cTikTok Pro,\u201d which asks for credentials and Android permissions\u2013including camera and phone permissions\u2014and resulted in the user being bombarded with advertisements, he said.Click to RegisterThe new wave has leveled up with a completely new app delivering \u201cfull-fledged spyware with premium features to spy on victim with ease,\u201d Desai wrote.Once installed and opened, the new \u201cTik Tok Pro\u201d spyware launches a fake notification which then disappears along with the app\u2019s icon. \u201cThis fake notification tactic is used to redirect the user\u2019s attention, meanwhile the app hides itself, making the user believe the app to be faulty,\u201d he said in his report.The malware also has another anti-detection capability in that it has an additional payload stored under the /res/raw/ directory, \u201ca common technique used by malware developers to bundle the main payload inside the Android package,\u201d Desai wrote. The payload is just a decoy rather than possesses actual app functionality, he added.The spyware\u2019s main execution capability comes from an Android service named MainService, which acts as the \u201cbrain\u201d of the spyware and controls its functionality\u2014\u201dfrom stealing the victim\u2019s data to deleting it,\u201d Desai wrote.In addition to having the ability to take over common smartphone functions\u2014such as capturing photos, sending SMS messages, executing commands, capturing screenshots, calling phone numbers and launching other apps on the device\u2014the spyware also has a unique feature it uses to steal Facebook credentials.Similar to phishing campaigns, \u201cTik Tok Pro\u201d launches a fake Facebook login page that, as soon as the victim tries to log in, stores the victim\u2019s credentials in /storage/0/DCIM/.fdat. An additional command, IODBSSUEEZ, then sends the stolen credentials to the malware\u2019s command and control server.Desai noted that this type of phishing tactic can be extended to steal other critical user credentials, such as bank-account or financial log-in data, though this type of activity wasn\u2019t seen in the observed campaign.Moreover, the new spyware has numerous functionalities similar to other more well-known versions of this type of malware, such as Spynote and Spymax, \u201cmeaning this could be an updated version of these Trojan builders,\u00a0which allow anyone, even with limited knowledge, to develop full-fledged spyware,\u201d Desai noted.However, the Facebook credential-stealing capability is unique to \u201cTik Tok Pro\u201d and not something that\u2019s been observed before with these spyware apps, he said.The persistence of using the TikTok brand to spread malware is likely the result of the current controversy over the popular video-sharing app, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance and has been criticized for its questionable data-collection tactics.President Trump has threatened to ban in the app in the United States and several U.S. companies\u2014including Microsoft and Wal-Mart\u2014are eyeing a purchase of the app. India recently banned TikTok as well as many other Chinese apps over a political dispute.\u201cUsers looking forward to using the TikTok app amidst the ban might look for alternative methods to download the app,\u201d Desai wrote in his report. \u201cIn doing so, users can mistakenly install malicious apps, such as the spyware mentioned in this blog.\u201dDesai reiterated the usual warnings to Android users not to trust unknown links received in SMS or other messages and to only install apps from official stores like Google Play to avoid falling victim to the new spyware campaign.Another mitigation tactic is to keep the \u201cUnknown Sources\u201d option disabled in the Android device, which won\u2019t let a device install apps from unknown sources, he added.To check to see if the new spyware is running undetected on an Android device, users can search for the app\u00a0in device settings\u00a0by going to \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSettings -> Apps ->\u00a0\u00a0Search for icon that was hidden and search for \u201cTikTok Pro,\u201d Desai advised.On Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.Mobile Security",

        "raw text": "Google has deleted six apps from its Google Play marketplace that were infecting users with the Joker malware (a.k.a. Bread).Together, the apps \u2013 which tout functionalities ranging from text messaging to emoji wallpaper \u2013 account for nearly 200,000 installs, researchers with Pradeo said in a post this week. As of Wednesday, Google confirmed with Threatpost that all infected applications have been removed from Google Play, but researchers said that they are still installed on the devices of their users, and urged users to immediately delete the apps.\u201cMost apps embedding Joker malware are programmed to load and execute external code after being published on the store,\u201d Roxane Suau, with Pradeo, told Threatpost. \u201cFirst, these apps are riddled with permission requests and submitted to Google Play by their developers. They get approved, published and installed by users. Once running on users\u2019 devices, they automatically download malicious code. Then, they leverage their numerous permissions to execute the malicious code.\u201dThe apps found with malware are: Convenient Scanner 2 (with 100,000 installs), Separate Doc Scanner (with 50,000 installs), Safety AppLock (with 10,000 installs), Push Message-Texting & SMS (with 10,000 installs), Emoji Wallpaper (with 10,000 installs) and Fingertip GameBox (with 1,000 installs). More information on these apps can be found here.The apps were expressly developed by individuals who programmed them to act maliciously, Suau told Threatpost. Suau said that looking at the apps\u2019 ratings revealed several red flags, including reviews that say the apps are fake (see graphic, below).Credit: PradeoJoker is a billing-fraud family of malware (which researchers categorize as \u201cfleeceware\u201d) that emerged in 2017 but began to ramp up in 2019.It advertises itself as a legitimate app, but once installed, simulates clicks and intercepts SMS messages to subscribe victims to unwanted, paid premium services (unbeknownst to them), researchers said.Malicious apps spreading the Joker have continued to\u00a0skirt Google Play\u2019s protections\u00a0since 2019, because the malware\u2019s author kept making\u00a0small changes to its code.\u201cBy using as little code as possible and thoroughly hiding it, Joker generates a very discreet footprint that can be tricky to detect,\u201d Suau said.In 2020, the Joker malware has continued to thrive on Google Play. In July, Google removed 11 malicious Android apps from the store that were spreading the malware, and in January, researchers revealed that Google had removed 17,000 Android apps at that point that had been conduits for the Joker malware.Hank Schless, senior manager for Security Solutions at Lookout, said that researchers continue to see Joker popping up in Android apps \u2014 and now with workforces going remote due to the current, ongoing pandemic, the threat of Joker being spread via productivity apps is increasing.\u201cBecause of how frequently Joker and other discreet malware appear in a wide variety of apps, mobile users need to leverage mobile security in order to keep themselves and their organizations safe,\u201d he said via email. \u201cEspecially in a time of global remote work, mobile devices and tablets are used for both work and personal reasons. If you download an app infected with Joker or other malware, you\u2019re giving the threat actor access to your personal data as well as any company data you access from that device.\u201dThe re-emergence of Joker malware in the Google Play Store also highlights the fundamental challenge of how users can know if a piece of software is reasonably secure, Jonathan Knudsen, senior security strategist with Synopsys said.\u201cIn an app store, it\u2019s impractical to understand the development processes for every app, so the store must rely on security testing to assess submitted apps,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many organizations, however, the procurement process offers untapped opportunities to assess how vendors build software, to perform rigorous testing, and to make informed decisions based on risk.\u201dOn Wed Sept. 16 @ 2 PM ET:\u00a0Learn the secrets to running a successful Bug Bounty Program.\u00a0Register today\u00a0for this\u00a0FREE\u00a0Threatpost webinar \u201cFive Essentials for Running a Successful Bug Bounty Program\u201c.\u00a0Hear from top\u00a0Bug Bounty Program experts\u00a0how to juggle public versus private programs and how to navigate the tricky terrain of managing Bug Hunters, disclosure policies and budgets.\u00a0Join us Wednesday Sept. 16, 2-3 PM ET for this\u00a0LIVE\u00a0webinar.MalwareMobile SecurityWeb Security",

        "raw text": "A campaign aimed at Mac users is spreading the XCSSET suite of malware, which has the capability to hijack the Safari web browser and inject various JavaScript payloads that can steal passwords, financial data and personal information, deploy ransomware and more.Infections are propagating via Xcode developer projects, researchers noted; the cybercriminals behind the campaign are injecting the malware into them, according to Trend Micro. Xcode consists of a suite of free, open software development tools developed by Apple for creating software for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS. Thus, any apps built on top of the projects automatically include the malicious code.The initial discovery of the threat came when \u201cwe learned that a developer\u2019s Xcode project at large contained the source malware \u2014 which leads to a rabbit hole of malicious payloads,\u201d according to an analysis [PDF] from Trend Micro, released on Friday. \u201cThe threat escalates when affected developers share their projects via platforms such as GitHub, leading to a supply-chain-like attack for users who rely on these repositories as dependencies in their own projects. We have also identified this threat in other sources including VirusTotal and Github, which indicates this threat is at large.\u201dThe initial payload tucked into the projects comes in the form of a Mach-O executable. The researchers were able to trace an infected project\u2019s Xcode work data files and found a hidden folder containing Mach-O, located in one of the .xcodeproj files.When executed, the Mach-O malware connects to a hardcoded command-and-control (C2) server address, and begins to take screenshots of the current desktop at the rate of once a minute; once a new screenshot is taken, the previous one is deleted, the analysis noted.However, Mach-O\u2019s main purpose is to download and run the second-stage payload, an AppleScript file called main.scpt, which carries out most of the malicious behavior.The research noted that when the \u201cMain\u201d payload is executed, it first harvests basic system information of the infected user, then kills certain running processes if present, including various browsers (Opera, Edge, Firefox, Yandex and Brave) as well as \u201ccom.apple.core,\u201d \u201ccom.oracle.java\u201d and others.The payload then gets down to real business, obtaining and compiling malicious code into a Mac app package. The package name is mapped to an installed, well-known application name, such as Safari. Researchers detailed that it then replaces the app\u2019s corresponding icon file and \u201cInfo.plist\u201d to make the fake app look like a real, normal app \u2013and thus, users go to open the normal app, the malicious one opens instead.According to the analysis, when opened, the fake app package\u2019s malicious capabilities are then executed, in the form of deploying a raft of modules used for various goals: Taking over browsers; stealing information from installed apps including Evernote, Skype and Telegram; and spreading to other hosts. It also has ransomware modules that it can deploy and dozens of other capabilities. Below is a partial list:The malware also uses a zero-day vulnerability in Data Vault that allows it to bypass macOS\u2019 System Integrity Protection (SIP) feature, in order to steal Safari cookies; and a Safari for WebKit Development zero-day that allows universal cross-site scripting (UXSS), which clears the way to inject JavaScript into the development version of Safari and other browsers without worrying about sandboxing.In the latter case, the malware injects the malicious JavaScript code into a current browser page. The attackers can then manipulate browser results; manipulate and replace found Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency addresses; replace a Chrome download link with a link to an old version package; steal Google, Yandex, Amocrm, SIPmarket, PayPal and Apple ID credentials; steal credit-card data linked in the Apple Store; prevent the user from changing passwords and also record new passwords; and take screenshots of certain accessed sites.Threatpost has reached out to Trend Micro to see if the zero-days have been reported and if any further particulars are available on them \u2013 scant details were offered in the analysis.The firm said that it was able to collect a list of victim IP addresses from the C2; this consisted of 380 individual infected targets; most were in China and India. Trend Micro noted that it observed the XCSSET malware affecting two Xcode projects so far, but warned that the campaign is very likely to spread.\u201cWith the OS X development landscape rapidly growing and improving \u2013 as proven by news on the latest Big Sur update, for instance \u2013 it\u2019s no surprise that malware actors now also leverage both aspiring and seasoned developers alike for their own benefit,\u201d Trend Micro concluded. \u201cProject owners should continue to triple-check the integrity of their projects in order to definitely nip unwarranted problems such as a malware infection in the future.\u201dIt\u2019s the age of remote working, and businesses are facing new and bigger cyber-risks \u2013 whether it\u2019s collaboration platforms in the crosshairs, evolving insider threats or issues with locking down a much broader footprint.

        "raw text": "Since COVID-19 cast its pall in March, the Agent Tesla remote-access trojan (RAT) has exploited the pandemic and added a raft of functionality that has helped it dominate the enterprise threat scene.Though Agent Tesla first made a splash six years ago, it hasn\u2019t lost any momentum \u2013 in fact, it is featured in more attacks in the first half of 2020 compared to the infamous TrickBot or Emotet malware, according to SentinelOne\u2019s SentinelLabs.\u00a0In April for instance, it was seen in targeted campaigns against the oil-and-gas industry.This continued success in attacking businesses is thanks to its continued ability to adapt to the latest cyber-landscape, the firm noted, with a fresh passel of variants appearing over the course of the year so far. It has most recently been spreading via coronavirus-themed phishing campaigns, Jim Walter, senior threat researcher at SentinelOne, noted in research issued on Monday.Click to register!Historically specializing in keylogging and data-stealing, Agent Tesla\u2019s new binaries offer \u201cmore robust spreading and injection methods as well as discovery and theft of wireless network details and credentials,\u201d Walter wrote.Further, it\u2019s now able to harvest configuration data and credentials from a number of common VPN clients, FTP and email clients and web browsers, the researcher said. This includes Apple Safari, BlackHawk, Brave, CentBrowser, Chromium, Comodo Dragon, CoreFTP, FileZilla, Google Chrome, Iridium, Microsoft IE and Edge, Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, OpenVPN, Opera, Opera Mail, Qualcomm Eudora, Tencent QQBrowser and Yandex, among others.\u201cThe malware has the ability to extract credentials from the registry as well as related configuration or support files,\u201d Walter explained. \u201cHarvested data is transmitted to the command-and-control (C2) via SMTP or FTP. The transfer method is dictated per the malware\u2019s internal configuration, which also includes credentials (FTP or SMTP) for the attacker\u2019s C2.\u201dAnother new trick for this old RAT is the fact that variants will now fetch secondary executables to install onto a victim\u2019s machine, and then inject code into those second-stage binaries \u2013 as an evasion-detection method. The variables will also attempt to inject into known (and vulnerable) binaries already present on targeted hosts.In one campaign, Walter\u2019s team observed Agent Tesla dropping a copy of RegAsm.exe and injecting additional code into it; subsequently, RegAsm.exe became responsible for handling the main jobs of data-harvesting and exfiltration. The injection is done using process hollowing, the research noted, in which which sections of memory are unmapped (hollowed) with that space then being reallocated with the desired malicious code.Other improvements can be seen in the malware\u2019s execution behavior. Upon launch, the malware gathers local system information, installs the keylogger module and initializes routines for discovering and harvesting data. Part of this process includes the ability to discover wireless network settings and credentials.\u201cAgent Tesla has been around for several years now, and yet we still see it utilized as a commodity in many low-to-mildly sophisticated attacks,\u201d Walter concluded. \u201cAttackers are continually evolving and finding new ways to use tools like Agent Tesla successfully while evading detection.\u201dComplimentary Threatpost Webinar: Want to learn more about Confidential Computing and how it can supercharge your cloud security?
